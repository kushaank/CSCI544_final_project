NEW research,look.01,into,,Affirmative,"NEW research is looking into the effects of children 's exposure to potentially dangerous PM10 particulate matter in urban , rural and mining - related settings . "
"A / Professor Andrea Hinwood , of",say.01,there is,,Affirmative,"A / Professor Andrea Hinwood , of Edith Cowan University , says there is considerable debate about the importance of size and type of particulate matter in terms of health effects , especially in dusty environments and those associated with mining . "
PM10,penetrate.01,deep into,,Affirmative,"With fine suspended particulates less than 10 microns in diameter , PM10 is capable of penetrating deep into the upper respiratory tract . "
Professor Hinwood,say.01,"are limited , with",,Affirmative,"Studies of the relationship between environmental exposure to PM10 and metals from mining activities are limited , with few studies focussing on iron ore dust , A / Professor Hinwood says . "
The study,see.01,70 children between,,Affirmative,"The study saw 70 children between the ages of six and 12 selected from Port Hedland , the nearby residential community South Hedland , and Perth . "
participants,provided.01,personal exposure to,,Affirmative,"Over 24 - hour periods , participants provided personal exposure to PM10 data collected by a SKC Aircheck sampler worn on their bodies , as well as hair and urine samples , daily activity diaries and information about potential exposure to particulate matter and metals through such things as cigarette smoke and bushfire smoke . "
by,collect.01,PM10 data collected by,,Affirmative,"Over 24 - hour periods , participants provided personal exposure to PM10 data collected by a SKC Aircheck sampler worn on their bodies , as well as hair and urine samples , daily activity diaries and information about potential exposure to particulate matter and metals through such things as cigarette smoke and bushfire smoke . "
The study,find.01,concentrations to be,,Affirmative,"Overall , the study found personal exposure PM10 concentrations to be generally low , though some extreme concentrations were recorded . "
Professor Hinwood,say.01,concentrations were elevated in,,Affirmative,"Hair metals concentrations were elevated in some cases , and there were some significant differences between children in the three areas , but concentrations could not be related to PM10 , A / Professor Hinwood says . "
from,benefit.01,concern,,Affirmative,"However , one area of concern that could benefit from further study was the elevated levels of manganese in hair samples from Port Hedland , possibly as a result of stockpiles and shipping of materials or exposure to iron ore dust . "
The study,suggest.01,is low,,Affirmative,"While the study suggests that children 's exposure to PM10 overall in Port Hedland is low , despite its mining activity , a larger study is recommended due to the current study 's small sample size . "
The University of,collaborate.01,in,,Affirmative,"The University of Western Australia , ChemCentre and The University of Queensland also collaborated in this study . "
