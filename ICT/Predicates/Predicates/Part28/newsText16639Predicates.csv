Dartmouth scientists,find.01,melting was not,,Affirmative,"Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Dartmouth scientists found that the melting was not the result of climate change alone , as conventional thinking had suggested . "
the researchers,say.01,change will result in,,Affirmative,"However , researchers also said that continued climate change will result in widespread annual melting by the end of the century . "
"Kaitlin Keegan ,",say.01,required,,Affirmative,"Kaitlin Keegan , lead author of the study , said : The widespread melting of the Greenland ice sheet required the combination of both of these effects - lowered snow albedo from ash and unusually warm temperatures - to push the ice sheet over the threshold . "
The widespread melting of,require.01,the combination of both of,,Affirmative,"Kaitlin Keegan , lead author of the study , said : The widespread melting of the Greenland ice sheet required the combination of both of these effects - lowered snow albedo from ash and unusually warm temperatures - to push the ice sheet over the threshold . "
the researchers,find.01,experienced,,Affirmative,"However , researchers found over 97 % of the sheet experienced surface melt in 2012 . "
97 % of,experience.01,surface melt in 2012,,Affirmative,"However , researchers found over 97 % of the sheet experienced surface melt in 2012 . "
the researchers,analyse.01,six of,,Affirmative,"Analysing six of the shallow ice cores from the dry snow region , researchers found that the most recent widespread melt prior to 2012 was in 1889 . "

"The forest fires , believed",reduce.01,lower albedo -LRB- the term for the reflecting power of a surface -RRB-,,Affirmative,"The forest fires , believed to have originated in Siberia and North America , reduced the albedo to below a critical threshold , causing large - scale melting , the authors said . "
the authors,say.01,reduced,,Affirmative,"The forest fires , believed to have originated in Siberia and North America , reduced the albedo to below a critical threshold , causing large - scale melting , the authors said . "
the researchers,assess.01,future melting,,Affirmative,"Assessing future melting , the researchers said that both Arctic temperatures and the frequency of forest fires are expected to rise , meaning melt events will take place almost annually by 2100 . "
the researchers,say.01,are expected,,Affirmative,"Assessing future melting , the researchers said that both Arctic temperatures and the frequency of forest fires are expected to rise , meaning melt events will take place almost annually by 2100 . "
this,alter.01,the surface mass balance of,,Affirmative,"This will alter the surface mass balance of the ice sheet , meaning the Greenland ice sheet will be at even greater risk of melting . "
