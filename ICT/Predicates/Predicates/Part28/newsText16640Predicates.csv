the meltwater,percolate.01,into,,Affirmative,"Melting in the dry snow region does not contribute to sea level rise ; instead , the meltwater percolates into the snowpack and refreezes , causing less sunlight to be reflected -- which scientists refer to as lower albedo -- and leaving the ice - sheet surface even more susceptible to future melting . "

"Kaitlin Keegan ,",say.01,", caused",,Affirmative,"Forest fires burning far from Greenland provided the ash that , along with the warm temperatures , caused widespread melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet , said Kaitlin Keegan , the lead author of the paper , which appears today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . "
Greenland,require.01,the combination of both of,,Affirmative,"It required the combination of both of these effects -- lowered snow albedo from ash and unusually warm temperatures -- to push the ice sheet over the threshold , said Keegan . "

"
the presence of,indicate.01,source was,,Affirmative,"The study did not focus explicitly on analyzing the ash to determine the source of the fires , but the presence of a high concentration of ammonium concurrent with the black carbon indicates the ash 's source was large boreal forest fires in Siberia and North America in June and July 2012 . "
which forest fires,deposit.01,ash,,Affirmative,"As for 1889 , there are historical records of testimony to Congress of large - scale forest fires in the Pacific Northwest of the United States that summer , but it would be difficult to pinpoint which forest fires deposited ash onto the ice sheet that summer .

The massive Greenland ice sheet,experience.01,annual melting,,Affirmative,"The massive Greenland ice sheet experiences annual melting at low elevations near the coastline , but melting at the surface is rare in the dry snow region at higher elevations in its center . "
97 percent of,experience.01,"surface melt ,",,Affirmative,"In mid-July 2012 , however , more than 97 percent of the ice sheet experienced surface melt , the first widespread melt during the era of satellite observation . "
analysis of,confirm.01,melt occurred in 1889,,Affirmative,The Dartmouth - led team 's analysis of six Greenland shallow ice cores from the dry snow region confirmed that the most recent prior widespread melt occurred in 1889 . 
"An ice core ,",demonstrate.01,reduced albedo below,,Affirmative,"An ice core , a cylinder of ice , from the center of the ice sheet demonstrated that exceptionally warm temperatures combined with black - carbon sediments from Northern Hemisphere forest fires reduced albedo below a critical threshold in the dry snow region and caused the large - scale melting events in both 1889 and 2012 . "

results,suggest.01,may begin,,Affirmative,"If , as expected , Arctic temperatures and the frequency of forest fires increase with climate change , the researchers ' results suggest that large - scale melt events on the Greenland ice sheet may begin to occur almost annually by the end of century . "
These events,alter.01,the surface mass - balance of,,Affirmative,"These events are likely to alter the surface mass - balance of the ice sheet , leaving the surface susceptible to further melting . "
