by warming alone,drive.02,the melt events,,Affirmative,"Rising temperatures and ash from Northern Hemisphere forest fires combined to cause large - scale surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet in 1889 and 2012 , contradicting conventional thinking that the melt events were driven by warming alone , a Dartmouth College - led study finds . "
The findings,suggest.01,change will result in,,Affirmative,"The findings suggest that continued climate change will result in nearly annual widespread melting of the ice sheet 's surface by the year 2100 , and that a positive feedback mechanism may be set in motion . "
the meltwater,percolate.01,into,,Affirmative,"Melting in the dry snow region does not contribute to sea level rise ; instead , the meltwater percolates into the snowpack and refreezes , causing lower albedo and leaving the ice sheet surface even more susceptible to future melting . "
the meltwater,cause.01,lower albedo,,Affirmative,"Melting in the dry snow region does not contribute to sea level rise ; instead , the meltwater percolates into the snowpack and refreezes , causing lower albedo and leaving the ice sheet surface even more susceptible to future melting . "
the meltwater,leave.01,sheet surface,more susceptible to,Affirmative,"Melting in the dry snow region does not contribute to sea level rise ; instead , the meltwater percolates into the snowpack and refreezes , causing lower albedo and leaving the ice sheet surface even more susceptible to future melting . "

by,support.01,The research,,Affirmative,The research was supported by the National Science Foundation and NASA . 
The widespread melting of,require.01,the combination of both of,,Affirmative,"The widespread melting of the Greenland ice sheet required the combination of both of these effects - lowered snow albedo from ash and unusually warm temperatures - to push the ice sheet over the threshold , says Kaitlin Keegan , the study 's lead author and a Dartmouth doctoral student . "
"Kaitlin Keegan ,",say.01,required,,Affirmative,"The widespread melting of the Greenland ice sheet required the combination of both of these effects - lowered snow albedo from ash and unusually warm temperatures - to push the ice sheet over the threshold , says Kaitlin Keegan , the study 's lead author and a Dartmouth doctoral student . "
The massive Greenland ice sheet,experience.01,annual melting,,Affirmative,"The massive Greenland ice sheet experiences annual melting at low elevations near the coastline , but surface melt is rare in the dry snow region in its center . "
97 percent of,experience.01,"surface melt ,",,Affirmative,"In July 2012 , however , more than 97 percent of the ice sheet experienced surface melt , the first widespread melt during the era of satellite observation . "
"Keegan ,",add.02,critical information,to,Affirmative,"Keegan , who added critical information to NASA 's announcement of the 2012 melt , studies firn , the newly deposited layers of snow atop the two - mile - thick ice sheet . "
analysis of,confirm.01,melt occurred in 1889,,Affirmative,"In the new study , the Dartmouth - led team 's analysis of six Greenland shallow ice cores from the dry snow region confirmed that the most recent prior widespread melt occurred in 1889 . "
An ice core from,demonstrate.01,reduced albedo below,,Affirmative,An ice core from the center of the ice sheet demonstrated that exceptionally warm temperatures combined with black carbon sediments from Northern Hemisphere forest fires reduced albedo below a critical threshold in the dry snow region and caused the large - scale melting events in both 1889 and 2012 . 
warm temperatures combined with,cause.01,scale melting events in,,Affirmative,An ice core from the center of the ice sheet demonstrated that exceptionally warm temperatures combined with black carbon sediments from Northern Hemisphere forest fires reduced albedo below a critical threshold in the dry snow region and caused the large - scale melting events in both 1889 and 2012 . 
the presence of,indicate.01,source was,,Affirmative,"The study did n't focus explicitly on analyzing the ash to determine the source of the fires , but the presence of a high concentration of ammonium concurrent with the black carbon indicates the ash 's source was large boreal forest fires during the summer in Siberia and North America in June and July 2012 . "
which forest fires,deposit.01,ash,,Affirmative,"As for 1889 , there are historical records of testimony to Congress of large - scale forest fires in the Pacific Northwest of the United States that summer , but it would be difficult to pinpoint which forest fires deposited ash onto the ice sheet that summer . "
the researchers ',use.01,Intergovernmental Panel,to project,Affirmative,The researchers also used Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change data to project the frequency of widespread surface melting into the year 2100 . 
the researchers ',project.01,the frequency of,,Affirmative,The researchers also used Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change data to project the frequency of widespread surface melting into the year 2100 . 
results,suggest.01,may begin,,Affirmative,"Since Arctic temperatures and the frequency of forest fires are both expected to rise with climate change , the researchers ' results suggest that large - scale melt events on the Greenland ice sheet may begin to occur almost annually by the end of century . "
These events,alter.01,the surface mass balance of,,Affirmative,"These events are likely to alter the surface mass balance of the ice sheet , leaving the surface susceptible to further melting . "
These events,leave.01,the ice sheet 's surface,susceptible to,Affirmative,"These events are likely to alter the surface mass balance of the ice sheet , leaving the surface susceptible to further melting . "
"Professor Mary Albert , co-author of",say.01,Earth is,,Affirmative,"Our Earth is a system of systems , says Thayer Professor Mary Albert , co-author of the study and the director of the U.S. Ice Drilling Program Office . "
one challenge,face.01,the next generation of engineers and scientists,,Affirmative,"Improved understanding of the complexity of the linkages and feedbacks , as in this paper , is one challenge facing the next generation of engineers and scientists - people like Kaitlin . "
