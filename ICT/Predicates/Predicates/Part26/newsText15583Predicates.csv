Marine Science Professor Graeme Hays,say.01,turtles are unusual in,,Affirmative,"Professor Hays says sea turtles are unusual in that the sex of hatchlings is determined not by sex chromosomes - as is the case in humans and other mammals - but by the incubation temperature , through a phenomenon known as ' temperature dependent sex determination . "
the majority of,produce.01,female hatchlings and,,Affirmative,"' Above a certain pivotal incubation temperature , typically near 29Â°C , the majority of sea turtle eggs produce female hatchlings and vice versa . "
This,mean.01,", may cause",,Affirmative,"This means that warming temperatures , occurring as part of global climate change , may cause the feminisation of sea turtle populations through the production of only female hatchlings . "

Marine Science Professor Graeme Hays,say.01,is not imminent in,,Affirmative,"Professor Hays says that despite predicted warming and increasingly female skewed sex ratios , entire feminisation of this population is not imminent in the next few decades . "
warm incubation temperatures,have.03,an unexpected conservation benefit of increasing,,Affirmative,In fact warm incubation temperatures may have an unexpected conservation benefit of increasing the number of breeding females and hence the total size of the population . 
Marine Science Professor Graeme Hays,say.01,", there have been",,Affirmative,"While this threat of feminisation of sea turtle populations has been known for many years , there have been few attempts to predict how the sex ratio of populations may change in the future and the resulting extinction risk , he said . "
