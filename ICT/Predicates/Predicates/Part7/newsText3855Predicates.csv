also by Petron and,performed.01,research performed from 2008-2010,,Affirmative,"The new paper provides independent confirmation of findings from research performed from 2008-2010 , also by Petron and her colleagues , on the magnitude of air pollutant emissions from oil and gas activities in northeastern Colorado . "
the team,use.01,detection instruments packed into,,Affirmative,"In the earlier study , the team used a mobile laboratory - sophisticated chemical detection instruments packed into a car - and an instrumented NOAA tall tower near Erie , Colorado , to measure atmospheric concentrations of several chemicals downwind of various sources , including oil and gas equipment , landfills and animal feedlots . "
the scientists,determine.01,were,,Affirmative,"Back then , the scientists determined that methane emissions from oil and gas activities in the region were likely about twice as high as estimates from state and federal agencies , and benzene emissions were several times higher . "
Weld County,have.03,wells,,Affirmative,"In 2008 , northeastern Colorado 's Weld County had about 14,000 operating oil and gas wells , all located in a geological formation called the Denver - Julesburg Basin . "
The new work,rely.01,on,,Affirmative,"The new work relied on a different technique , too , called mass - balance . "
Petron and,contract.02,to measure,with,Affirmative,"In 2012 , Petron and her colleagues contracted with a small aircraft to measure the concentrations of methane and other chemicals in the air downwind and upwind of the Denver - Julesburg Basin . "

Petron and,calculate.01,were emitted hourly in,,Affirmative,Petron and her team calculated that 26 metric tons of methane were emitted hourly in a region centered on Weld County . 
the authors,subtract.01,inventory estimates of,,Affirmative,"To estimate the fraction from oil and gas activities , the authors subtracted inventory estimates of methane emissions from other sources , including animal feedlots , landfills and wastewater treatment plants . "
Petron and,find.01,emitted,,Affirmative,"Petron and her team found that during those two days , oil and gas operations in the Denver - Julesburg Basin emitted about 19 metric tons of methane per hour , 75 percent of the total methane emissions . "
operations in,emit.01,19 metric tons of methane per hour,,Affirmative,"Petron and her team found that during those two days , oil and gas operations in the Denver - Julesburg Basin emitted about 19 metric tons of methane per hour , 75 percent of the total methane emissions . "
Petron and,combine.01,information,from,Affirmative,"Petron and her colleagues combined information from the mass - balance technique and detailed chemical analysis of air samples in the laboratory to come up with emissions estimates for volatile organic compounds , a class of chemicals that contributes to ozone pollution ; and benzene , an air toxic . "
the new results,suggest.01,operations may also be,,Affirmative,Car and truck tailpipes are a known source of the toxic chemical ; the new results suggest that oil and gas operations may also be a significant source . 
Ozone at,harm.01,lungs and damage crops and,,Affirmative,"Ozone at high levels can harm people 's lungs and damage crops and other plants ; the northern Front Range of Colorado has been out of compliance with federal health - based 8 - hour ozone standards since 2007 , according to the EPA . "
led paper published,show.01,activities were responsible for,,Affirmative,Another CIRES - and NOAA - led paper published last year showed that oil and natural gas activities were responsible for about half of the contributions of VOCs to ozone formation in northeastern Colorado .
