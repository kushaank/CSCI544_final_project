
The head of Ofsted has defended inspectors who were forced to abandon a visit to a Muslim primary school after parents complained that they questioned children about homosexuality.

Sir Michael Wilshaw issued a statement yesterday to explain why members of an inspection team asked children at the school if they had been taught what gay means.

Inspectors withdrew on the second day of their visit to Olive Tree primary school, a small private Muslim school in a poor area of Luton, after a group of parents threatened to take their children home until they left.
