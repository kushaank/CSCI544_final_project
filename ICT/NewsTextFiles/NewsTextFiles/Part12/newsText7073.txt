
I read a chilling article by Northern Christian Association of Nigeria, saying Muslims kidnapped and forced Christian girls to convert to Islam…….

Such articles that suffocate majority every day Muslims, who never affords to write back their feelings yet they are dependable allies in the fight against terrorism will continue to inflame emotions.

Certainly, the problem is not Muslims but, the political radicalisation of religion that creates militant ideologies. Boko Haram and other terrorists cite political grievances to support their response, not religious justification.

Speaking to Aljazeera’s Hamza Mohamed why Westgate Mall, full of civilians was attacked, Al-habab spokesperson said they were telling the Kenyan government to withdraw troops from Somalia, not Islamisation of Kenya.

The young men who were charged for coordinating the July bombings in Lugogo and Kabalagala were not from failed families.
