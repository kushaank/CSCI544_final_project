
In an interview with journalist César Miguel Rondón, Henry Ramos Allup, the secretary general of opposition Acción Democrática party (Democratic Action, AD), commented that the government's "internal fracture" precludes it from taking actions in connection with the agreements reached during the government-opposition talks.

"There is no further progress in the dialogue because the government does not make any decisions," stressed the opposition leader.

Ramos Allup stated that the government must start by designating a single spokesperson, as any "agreement reached by one of their representatives, is later derailed by another one."
