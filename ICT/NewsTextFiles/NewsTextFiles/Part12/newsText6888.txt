[Via Satellite 05-19-2014] The most recent Boeing-built Global Positioning System (GPS) 2F satellite sent its first signals from space following its launch on Friday, May 16, 2014. This marks the halfway point of the 12 launches scheduled by the United States Air Force for the GPS 2F constellation.

The satellite was launched at 8:03 p.m. EST from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Delta 4 medium-plus configuration Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) rocket. The Delta 4 used a single ULA common booster core powered by an Aerojet Rocketdyne Rocket System (RS) 68 engine, with two ATK 60-inch Graphite Epoxy Motors (GEM 60).

Three hours after launch, Boeing controllers in El Segundo, Calif. confirmed that the satellite was sending signals from orbit at about 11,000 nautical miles above Earth. Boeing will perform activation and systems checkout before handing over the satellite to the Air Force as part of the GPS constellation.
