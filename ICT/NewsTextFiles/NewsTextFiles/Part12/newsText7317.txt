
The anti-gas protest camp at Bentley will be dismantled this week but opponents warn they will keep up the fight to stop the Coal Seam Gas industry.

For months, hundreds of gas industry opponents have been camping on a property adjacent to Metgasco's proposed drilling site but they will now leave following the suspension of the company's exploration licence.

The New South Wales Resources Minister, Anthony Roberts, blamed a lack of proper community consultation and concerns about the company's shareholdings,  which have now been referred to the Independent Commission Against Corruption.

Adam Guise, from Gasfield Free Northern Rivers, says the camp site will be dismantled but the company is still being monitored.

He says some protesters will now go to other areas under threat.

"People recognise that Bentley is a flagship for success in the Northern Rivers and it is a beacon of light to other people fighting invasive coal and gas throughout New South Wales and if not Australia," said Mr Guise.

"Many of these people will now be involved in other action at the Pilliga and Gloucester Valley," he said.
