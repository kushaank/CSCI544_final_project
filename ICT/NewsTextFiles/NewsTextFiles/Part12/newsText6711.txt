
This rendering of DeBartolo Development's $500 million Ka Makana Alii shopping mall project in Hawaii shows Macy's as an anchor tenant. The Florida-based developer tells PBN it is in negotiations with the retailer.

Macyâ€™s Inc. is in active negotiations with DeBartolo Development to be the anchor tenant of the developer's planned 1.4-million-square-feet, $500 million shopping mall in Hawaii, Ka Makana Alii in West Oahu, a spokesman with the Florida-based mall developer told PBN.

Renderings of the 67-acre mall, which will be located at the intersection of Kapolei and Kualakai parkways, also show Macyâ€™s as part of the project.

Several sources also have told PBN that Macyâ€™s (NYSE: M) may open a new store in the East Kapolei mall, which will be built on land leased from the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands .

The DeBartolo Development spokesman also said that the firm is negotiating with several other national and local tenants for its first Hawaii mall, which will be the third largest of its kind in the state, following only Ala Moana Center and Pearlridge Center .

Cincinnati-based Macyâ€™s did not immediately return messages left by PBN.

Macyâ€™s, which in January said that it will be laying off about 2,500 employees as part of the retailerâ€™s plan to implement cost reductions, has about a dozen stores in Hawaii with none of the Isle stores on this closure list.

Macy's, which was founded in New York, said earlier this year that it plans to hire about 250 employees for its first Hawaii Bloomingdaleâ€™s store at Ala Moana Center that is scheduled to open in the fall of 2015.
