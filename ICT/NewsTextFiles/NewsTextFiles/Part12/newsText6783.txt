
DELTONA, Fla. (WOFL FOX 35 ORLANDO) - A mother in Deltona, Florida, who hasn’t seen her daughter since 2009, was reunited with her now 12-year-old daughter on Saturday in Miami.

Cara Cox was just 8 years old when investigators say her father, Aaron Cox, fled to Mexico with her.

The girl’s mother, Jodie Borchert, had legal custody of the girl, but after one weekend visitation with her father in August 2009, she and her father disappeared.

Borchert reported her daughter missing to the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office who issued an arrest warrant for Aaron Cox, 55.

Years went by with no leads until a tip came into the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children on Monday that revealed Cara Cox was spotted in Mexico.

In a joint effort spanning multiple agencies, including the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office and U.S. Marshals, Cara Cox was tracked down to a remote area in the mountains of Hidalgo, Mexico, two hours outside of Mexico City.

On Friday, surveillance conducted in the area led to Aaron Cox’s arrest and the recovery of Borchert’s daughter.

Investigators learned that the pair had no known ties to Mexico and had been living under assumed names.

Agents worked to fast-track a passport for Cara Cox to get her back to the U.S.

On Saturday, she flew from Mexico City to Miami where she was reunited with her mother.

Aaron Cox was taken into custody by investigators in Miami, where he awaits extradition back to Volusia County.
