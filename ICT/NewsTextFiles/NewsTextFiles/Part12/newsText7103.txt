KUCHING: South Korea’s ambassador to Malaysia Cho Byung-Jae has praised Sarawak for its biodiversity preservation and conservation efforts.

Cho noted that the government had adopted the right approach to, among others, preserve wildlife in the state.

“I am quite impressed that Sarawak is doing a lot to protect all these animals, particularly animals which are in need of protection. The state is not just taking in wild animals, but also taking care of those in need,” he told reporters covering his visit to Matang Wildlife Centre near here yesterday.

Cho also lauded the state and federal government for their good cooperation at the multilateral level.

“We (South Korea and Malaysia) have bilateral and multilateral ties, and biodiversity is a common theme for every country these days. South Korea and Malaysia, especially the Sarawak government, are very active in this area.

During his two-day visit to the state, Cho would also be visiting Bako National Park and the Samalaju Industrial Estate in Bintulu.
