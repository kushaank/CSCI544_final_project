
CAMP HANSEN, Japan - Sakae Ginoza, a former member of the Kin Town Assembly, visited 7th Communication Battalion May 9 during a battalion quarterly training event to speak on the history of Camp Hansen and the positive effect of the Marine Corps’ presence on Okinawa.

Ginoza was invited to speak when the battalion commander wanted the Marines to learn the perspectives of people they share the island with, according to Maj. Matt C. Frazier, the company commander and an electronic maintenance officer with Service Company, 7th Comm. Bn., III Marine Expeditionary Force Headquarters Group, III MEF.

With the help of volunteer translator Noriko Sharik, Ginoza recounted his own experiences during World War II, when he was treated with kindness by the Marines and received food from them. He is grateful for the Marines and encourages further interaction between the U.S. and Japan.

The presence of the U.S. armed forces has been a positive influence on the people, and the interaction between the two builds an understanding of their two cultures, according to Ginoza.

For the Marines in attendance, Ginoza’s visit was both informative and interesting, according to Cpl. Tawnya N. Leza, a motor vehicle operator with the battalion.

The Marines appreciated Ginoza’s visit and hope that similar visits can happen during future events, according to Frazier.
