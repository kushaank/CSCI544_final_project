
An agreement was signed during the Cannes Film Festival to strengthen ties between the film and TV industries in Denmark and New Zealand .

The document marking the formal co-production collaboration was signed by Henrik Bo Nielsen of the Danish Film Institute and New Zealand Film Commission 's Dave Gibson today, 19 May.

The new status means that Danish films can apply for funding in New Zealand and vice versa. Further changes mean that those applying will find parts of the procedure simplified, as resident permits will be easier to obtain and processes will be ratified on the transportation of equipment between the two countries.
