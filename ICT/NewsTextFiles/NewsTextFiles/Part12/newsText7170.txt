
The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has said Nigeria has 10 million children without education, making it the highest country in the world without such facility.According to a statement by UNICEF, almost one of three primary-school aged children and one in four secondary-school aged children is not enrolled.

â€œIn many states, girls are twice as likely to be out of school as boys. In some parts of Nigeria, only 5 percent of the poorest young women are literate.

â€œGiven these challenges, it is disturbing that the girls were abducted to prevent them from attending school, UNICEF said in the statement condemning the abduction of schoolgirls in Nigeria.

UNICEF said that recent kidnappings and violent attacks had made it difficult for children in northern Nigeria to get education, as thousands of families are fleeing their homes and pulling their children out of school.

In the last three months alone, the United Nation’s organisation reported that at least 15,000 children in northern Nigeria had stopped attending classes.

â€œIt’s heart-stopping data,â€� UNICEF’s chief of child protection, Susan Bissell said.

The organisation’s programmes in Nigeria focus on the problems of violence and abuse against children in schools and work to address the issues of girls’ education and out-of-school children.

The UNICEF-supported Girls’ Education Project aims to give 1 million girls access to better quality education in northern Nigeria-through increased enrolment, scholarships for female teachers and the establishment of safe spaces for girls.
