
iNVEZZ.com, Monday, May 19: Unilever (LON:ULVR) has simplified its share structure by buying up the rights left in family trusts by co-founder William Hesketh Lever.

The Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant said in a regulatory statement today that it had bought the rights for Â£715 million â€“ equivalent to Â£10.00 a share, a 63 percent discount to Unileverâ€™s Friday closing price of Â£27.04.

As a result of the announced transaction, the companyâ€™s core earnings per share are expected to be enhanced by two percent on a full year basis as the fully diluted share count used in the calculation is reduced by 70,875,000 shares, or 2.4 percent of the combined total of Unilever Group, which comprises of London-listed Unilever Plc and Amsterdam-listed Unilever NV.

Hesketh Lever founded Lever Brothers Ltd., one of the companies which later became Unilever, in the UK in 1885. When he died in 1925, he left rights to a large number of Unilever shares in various trusts. These would have been converted at the end of 2038 into 70.9 million Unilever shares, or about 5.4 percent of the companyâ€™s share capital.

Unilever -- which owns brands ranging from Colmanâ€™s mustard, PG Tips tea and Wallâ€™s ice-cream to Dove soap, Lynx deodorant and TresemmÃ© shampoo â€“ was created in 1930 when Lever Brothers merged with the Netherlandsâ€™ Margarine Unie. To avoid punitive taxes, two controlling companies were set up with identical boards and mutual sharing of brands and technology.

Unilever CEO Jean-Marc HuÃ«t said in the groupâ€™s statement today: â€œI am very pleased that we have concluded this agreement with the trusts. It is good for all our shareholders. It is another step in the simplification of Unilever's capital structure, making Unilever easier to understand, and eliminating ahead of time the burden of a significant dilution of shareholders' interests."

Unilever, which last month reported a decline in quarterly sales ( Unilever share price: Currency woes weigh on Q1 sales ), has been trading in a positive territory so far today. As of 13:09 BST, the stock was changing hands at 2,739.00p â€“ 1.28 percent up on the day, one of the biggest gains on the FTSE 100.
