
A socio-political group, the Nigerian Regeneration Group, has called on northern leaders, especially Mallam Adamu Ciroma and Professor Ango Abdullahi to overlook their grievances and urgently join hands with President Goodluck Jonathan to help reverse the poor security situation and raise the living standards of  Nigerians nationwide.

The group made the call at an emergency meeting held in Ibadan over the weekend to review the state of the nation. Convener of the group, Chief Akintayo Akin-Deko, recalled that Mallam Ciroma and his group of northern elders had consistently withheld their support for President Jonathan’s emergence as president in 2011 for two reasons. Firstly because Dr. Jonathan’s emergence after the death of former president, Alhaji Umar YarAdua, was seen as unjust, as it breached the existing zoning arrangement  in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)..

The second reason, according to the group,  was that Dr. Jonathan having moved from Deputy Governor to Governor of Bayelsa State, and from there to became Vice-President and President of Nigeria all in six years, the university don did not have the requisite experience nor national goodwill to preside over a country as complex as Nigeria.

The group noted that the deteriorating security and economic situation at the grassroots especially in  the North-east and the growing social unrest nationwide, which has caused creeping impoverishment and alienation amongst the masses, has proved Ciroma, a  former Minister of Agriculture and Central Bank Governor absolutely correct, but said that as elders they should not be seen to be gloating.

“Every single one of our elderly politicians from every corner of Nigeria must now sit down together to work out a lasting solution that will urgently restore justice, a sense of belonging and competence to governance in Nigeria,” it said.

The group commended the current “Bring Back Our Girls” campaign which had gone viral on the internet and has attracted world attention to the kidnap of the over 250 girls at Chibok in Borno State.
