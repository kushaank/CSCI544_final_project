
A London court has been told Rolf Harris 'tongue kissed' an 11-year-old girl immediately after asking her how old she was.

The assault allegedly occurred in Darwin in 1969 when the alleged victim was off school sick, staying with mutual friends.

The woman is the first Australian witness to give evidence on day six of the indecent assault trial in London.

The court also heard from a New Zealand woman who claims she was  assaulted by Harris as a teenager in 1970.

She met the entertainer while working for a wine company at a party in New Zealand. She was 16 or 17 at the time.

The alleged victim asked Harris for his autograph and posed for  photographs before he asked for a dance.

'In a flash, in a moment, I saw the dark side of a man who I  thought could be trusted,' the woman said before being overcome with emotion.

The entertainer can't be charged over the incidents because they occurred outside the UK before 1997. The law has subsequently been changed.

Harris is charged with indecently assaulting four girls in the  UK between 1968 and 1986.

The 84-year-old denies the charges.
