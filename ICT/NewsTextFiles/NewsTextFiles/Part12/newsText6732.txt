
Top Republican officials on Sunday defended raising questions about Hillary Clinton’s health and age as she weighs a presidential bid in 2016.

The comments come after longtime GOP political operative Karl Rove, a regular contributor to The Wall Street Journal editorial pages, referenced a health scare Mrs. Clinton, a Democrat, suffered in December 2012. She became dehydrated, fainted and sustained a concussion, according to statements from her doctors and the State Department. Doctors later found and treated a blood clot between her brain and skull. Mr. Rove said at an event earlier this month that she suffered a “traumatic brain injury” and should disclose more details about it, The Wall Street Journal reported last week.

Mrs Clinton hasn’t yet announced whether she will run. Her spokesman previously said Mr. Rove was “flat out lying” in his remarks about her health and said the remarks amounted to a “desperate” attack. “They are scared of what she has achieved and what she has to offer,” the spokesman said.

Sen. Claire McCaskill (D., Mo.), appearing later on NBC, said Mr. Rove was struggling to be relevant and that his raising concerns about Mrs. Clinton was a cheap political shot.

Mr. Rove also said Mrs. Clinton would be 69 on election day in 2016. Appearing on Fox on Sunday, he said his remarks were about the considerations she would be weighing in deciding whether to run for president. If elected, she’d be the second-oldest person to be sworn in behind Ronald Reagan.

I think what should matter most is if she is crooked or not.  Even if her health is not that great, at least she should be a corruption buster in there to clean up Washington.

We would know, Karla, because they would then start sounding like a Democrat!

She would not run if she was in bad health. Her health is and will be checked if she decides to run. She is no more likelly at this point to have a stroke than any of the rest of us.

President Clinton stated that Hillary had a “terrible” concussion (traumatic brain injury) which took six months of very serious work to get over.  Of course her health and the health of any presidential candidate is a legitimate concern for the voters.
