
One of the biggest knocks on Nike throughout the years is its lack of domestic manufacturing. According to the Portland Business Journal, that could change.

Over the past year, Nike has eliminated more than 100,000 jobs in Southeast Asia, where the brand relies on contracted factory workers—some of who have even gone on strike .

As Twitter co-founder Biz Stone alluded to recently , Nike could one day become a strictly technological company. The PBJ's article mentions that Nike is attempting to bring its manufacturing closer and closer to its high-demand markets, which include North America and Europe.

The products are becoming increasingly easier to make—including the brand's revolutionary Flyknit technology. This realization would allow for assembly to occur in North America and potentially create American jobs.

Imagine that: People working for Nike in America other than retail, design, or corporate positions.
