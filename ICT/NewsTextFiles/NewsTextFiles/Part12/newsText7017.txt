
Google, the ever-vigilant all-world search engine that seemingly never forgets any occasion, remembered today what many of us probably didn’t even know in the first place: Rubik’s Cube turns 40 years old.

Google paid homage to the venerable brain-teasing classic cube puzzle with the latest in a long line of Google Doodles — animated tributes to important and noteworthy people and moments in history.

People who go to Google.com today will likely find more than they planned on searching for when they see a digital, interactive version of the toy, allowing users to actually click on it and try to solve the puzzle.

It’s probably been a while since you gave it a whirl, so here’s a quick refresher course.

Hungarian architect Erno Rubik in 1974 came up with his bright idea to create “an object that was not supposed to be possible,” according to Rubiks.com .

40 years later, an estimated 350 million Rubik’s Cubes have been sold worldwide.

His solid cube twisted and turned - and still it did not break or fall apart. With colourful stickers on its sides, the Cube got scrambled and thus emerged the first 'Rubik's Cube.' It took well over a month for Erno to work out the solution to his puzzle. Little did he expect that Rubik's Cube would become the world's best-selling toy ever.

Now go find your Rubik’s Cube, dust it off, and give it another spin for old time’s sake.
