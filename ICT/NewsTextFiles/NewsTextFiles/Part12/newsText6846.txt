
Chief of General Staff Gen. Necdet Ã–zel and other top military officers traveled to disaster-hit Soma on Monday to pay their respects at the graves of the mineworkers who were killed in last week's tragedy.

The military delegation went first to the Miners' Cemetery, where the deceased have been buried, and put flowers on the graves of the victims of the Soma mine disaster. Later, prayers were read for the miners. After putting red carnations on the graves, the military delegation left the cemetery to visit the families of some of the victims in their homes.

The Soma mine blast caused the death of at least 301 Turkish miners, making the accident the worst mining disaster in the country's history.
