
Medway’s second oldest military site is up for sale and could become a new housing development.

Kitchener Barracks in Chatham is being sold by the Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO), which is part of the MOD, after being identified as surplus to military requirements.

It was listed for disposal in the 2011 MOD Land and Property Disposal Strategy, which noted the “potential for a residential- led development scheme”.

The Barracks were originally called Chatham Infantry Barracks, they became known as Kitchener Barracks in the 1920s.

A DIO spokesman said: “Kitchener Barracks is in the process of being sold and the sale should be completed by late July.

She said a number of interested parties have submitted bids to develop the 11-acre site and these are being assessed.

Kitchener Barracks are being sold by the MoD.

Originally called Chatham Infantry Barracks, Kitchener was constructed in 1757 and its continuous military use since then makes it one of the oldest such sites nationally.

There are two listed buildings on the site, an ordnance store and a building dating from 1757, which is currently used as offices for 24 Squadron. Part of the boundary wall also has listed status.

It was one of the first large scale Army barracks in England, providing accommodation for the garrison of the fortifications of Chatham Dockyard.

It is believed the site could become a housing development.

The site became known as Kitchener Barracks in 1928, and is used as accommodation by the Royal School of Military Engineering.

Medway’s oldest military site is the single barrack block at Upnor Castle, built in 1719.
