
DUBAI // Two armed robbers who used a 10,000-volt stun gun before stealing Dh900,000 from a Transguard armoured lorry were jailed for three years on Monday.

At Dubai Criminal Court, Nigerians A J, 25, and J K, 23, admitted  armed robbery and possessing a stun gun.

The court heard that on October 13 last year, Ugandan employee W K, 28, and his Nepalese co-worker M J, 24, were on their way  to Lulu Village in Al Muhaisnah to fill up ATM machines when they were attacked by the two robbers.

W K told the court: “One of them punched me several times and the other assaulted my colleague with a taser gun then took away two bags we were carrying and fled in a car that was waiting for them.

An eyewitness wrote down the plate number of the getaway car and reported it to police when they arrived to the scene of the crime.

When interrogated by the police, the two men confessed to the crime and claimed that there were two other men who had helped them out – one who planned the robbery and the other who drove the getaway vehicle.

This car was found abandoned in an industrial area, with the empty money bags inside.

Police also found two face masks and the stun gun in the car.

The Nigerians will be deported after completing their sentence.
