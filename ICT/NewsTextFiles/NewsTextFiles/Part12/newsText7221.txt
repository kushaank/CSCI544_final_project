
A fake doctor who ran a clinic in the Gelderland town of Huissen has been arrested for carrying out medical treatments without qualifications.

The 52-year-old man was named as Fred B by l ocal broadcaster Omroep Gelderland. He ran the Medisch Center Sanit clinic and is suspected of assault, fraud and breaking drugs laws.

The arrest follows a complaint by a 65-year-old woman from Arnhem who was told by B that she had breast cancer.

She claims to have paid â‚¬60,000 to be treated in China. However, when she went for a check up at a hospital in the Netherlands, it transpired she did not have cancer at all.

Three other victims have also come forward and made formal complaints, the broadcaster says. One of those is another cancer victim who died in China. A third is said to be a person suffering from serious acne.

Fred B denies all the charges against him, Omroep Gelderland says.
