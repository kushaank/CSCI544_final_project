We believe that generic drugs will be a key element of Mexico's healthcare modernisation. They are a very effective way in which the government can control public spending while trying to increase medicines coverage. However, in the long term, Mexico's improving private health insurance sector and potentially significant investment from the government will boost patented drug consumption in the country.
