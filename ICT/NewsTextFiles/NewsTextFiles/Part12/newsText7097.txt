
KUALA LUMPUR: An eight-year-old boy fell to his death from a height of 15 storeys at the Pudu Ulu People’s Housing Project (PPR) in Cheras on Monday.

Police have confirmed that Muhd Danial Abdullah had climbed through an unbarred window on the 15th floor of the flat and walked out onto the ledge, to allegedly locate a handyman on the 17th floor, when he accidentally plunged to his death.

“He was instantly killed by the fall and his body was sent to Hospital University Kebangsaan Malaysia (HUKM) for post-mortem.

“He died from severe head injuries,” said Cheras OCPD Asst Comm Mohan Singh, adding that the case had been classified as Sudden Death (SDR).

The boy’s parents, satay sellers Abdullah Mat Rejab, 48, and Faizah Ahmad, 46, said they usually set up their stall by 5pm daily but did not do so on Monday.

The distraught father said a friend of Muhd Danial had rushed to his house to inform Abdullah of the fall.

“I immediately ran to the spot.

“My whole body turned to jelly as soon as I saw him lying lifeless on the ground,” Abdullah said.

A resident of the PPR who declined to be named said that the window which Muhd Danial climbed through had been left open for a few days to allow for renovation and repair work.

“There used to be safety bars installed on the window, but they were recently removed,” he said.
