The Tanbur, the instrument which the SHAHTAR is based on is considered the most sacred instrument of Iran and while pictured on carved reliefs dating back to 3000 years ago is also considered by many to be the oldest lute of the world!

In Iran it is the choice of instrument for many Sufi's and as a result until recently was not even taught or performed to the non-Sufi community, the instrument is also traditionally usually performed only after certain sacred rituals have been performed such as kissing the instrument, performing ablution, etc. & as a result Shirzad is mostly known in the world music community as a drummer and not a string (lute) performer.

While privileged to have been able to study this instrument in Iran, Shirzad also embarked on a spiritual journey as well and became familiar with many Sufi orders worldwide, such as Nimatollahi Order, Sufi Ruhaniat Order, Shahmaqsoudi Order, Muhiyedeen Order & even the Qalandariyun & was finally formerly officially initiated into the Naqshbandi Order & even participated in the Kumbh Mela festival and enjoyed the companionship of the Baul's of India.

He is also a Daf (Sufi Frame Drum) performer and has performed alongside very well known world renowned Sufi ensembles such as AHURA and has also participated in many of number of Sufi ceremonies and gatherings of Zikr (Chanting) & Whirling worldwide.

Shirzad has recorded and released two Sufi albums which combine elements of Sufi chants, sacred Maqams and electronica which are officially released to the public & are available online.
