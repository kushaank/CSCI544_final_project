A man was hit and killed by a train near the North Lafayette Street bridge in Shelby on Monday, according to the Shelby Police Department.

“As of 9:30 a.m., we had a pedestrian hit at the North Lafayette Street Bridge,” Shelby Police Chief Jeff Ledford said.

A white male identified as James Phillip Bell, 51, of Mooresboro, was hit by a CSX empty coal train headed west. Police believe that Bell was near the bridge when he was struck and then dragged about 200 yards west with the train.

Police were uncertain how Bell was struck and what might have happened.

As of 12:30 p.m. Monday, police were still investigating, and CSX had brought in a team to investigate as well.

North Washington and Lafayette streets from Seaboard to Grover streets were blocked for several hours by the stopped train and emergency vehicles.

“This is a good time to reiterate about safety on train tracks,” Ledford said.

People need to remember not to walk on tracks and to be careful while crossing tracks, he said.

Police continue to investigate what happened to Bell.
