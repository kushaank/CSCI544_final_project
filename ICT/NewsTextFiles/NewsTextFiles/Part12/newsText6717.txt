
Arthur Goldmammer has translated some 130 books from the French and makes his living solely from translations, something increasingly rare today.

has sold over 300,000 copies to date, making Piketty a media darling and that rarest of all creatures: a celebrity economist.

But getting somewhat ignored in all the talk is the book’s translator, Arthur Goldhammer.

Writing for marketplace.org , David Gura writes that Goldhammer met Piketty at Harvard, when the economist was lecturing a few years back. Later, Piketty asked him to translate his book, Le Capital au XXIe siècle , into English.

He adds that there’s something about Goldhammer that makes him stand out professionally: “I would say, there are maybe 20, 30 people in the English-speaking world who live by book translation alone.” And Goldhammer, he says, is one of them.

Case in point: The French-American Foundation awards a prize for translation every year. Goldhammer has won it four times.

Gura writes that while Goldhammer won’t say how much he got paid to translate “Capital,” but allows that while translators can earn decent money, it’s still less than a tenured professor’s salary. Most translators, he told Gura, are paid a fee for every 1,000 words.

“I this case, I probably would have made out if I had taken royalties, but I didn’t.” Of course, both Goldhammer and the book’s publisher, Harvard University Press, had expected the translation to sell in the range of 20,000 copies. Even so, Goldhammer told Gura, he has no regrets.
