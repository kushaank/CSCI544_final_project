
The Moods of Norway International brand threw a shindig on the 17th at its flagship store on 7964 Melrose Ave. in Los Angeles. Honest-to-goodness Norwegian Stefan Dahlkvist, co-founder of Moods, hosted  the party for 300 of his best friends where they dined on Norwegian waffles and threw back some Moscow Mules, which, er, are not a Norwegian drink.  Happy birthday Norway!
