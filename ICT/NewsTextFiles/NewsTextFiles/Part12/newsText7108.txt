
Kuala Lumpur : Malaysia would discuss with Inmarsat release of the "raw data" sought by the families of those on board the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said Monday.

"In light of the recent demands by the next of kin for the Inmarsat 'raw data', I have instructed the Malaysian Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) to discuss with Inmarsat on the release of the aforementioned data for public consumption," Xinhua quoted Hishammuddin as saying in a statement.

Hishammuddin said this was consistent with their stand for greater transparency and prioritising the interests of the family members of those on board the missing plane.

The minister said hydro-graphic experts from Malaysia, China and Australia met over the weekend. They agreed to carry out an extensive bathymetric survey of the areas provided by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau in the Southern Indian Ocean, he added.

Hishammuddin said the survey would be conducted by the Chinese survey ship Zhu Kezhen, which was scheduled to sail for the survey area Wednesday if weather permits.

At the same time, a team of technical experts met in Canberra, Australia, to discuss and refine the satellite data, calculations and analysis from Inmarsat, he said.
