
An unseen interview with the murdered politician Pim Fortuyn will be broadcast on Tuesday during the tv programme Altijd Wat (always something).

Pim Fortuyn was a doctor of philosophy who became a politician and formed his own party, List Pim Fortuyn or LPF, in 2002. He was murdered that year.

Fortuyn provoked controversy with his views on multiculturalism, immigration and Islam in the Netherlands, but unlike PVV leader Geert Wilders, he explicitly distanced himself from far right parties such as the Austrian FPO and the French Front National.

The well-spoken and nattily dressed Fortuyn was shot dead during the 2002 national election campaign, in which he was forecast to do well. His killer, Volkert van der Graaf, was released from prison earlier this month.

The interview was conducted 12 years ago, just four days before his death at the age of 57. In it, Fortuyn talks about the European Union, which is why the makers of Altijd Wat are including parts of it in their programme.

In the interview, Fortuyn says: 'As prime minister, I will work tirelessly for expansion of the EU, for safety and security. But I will say how much this will cost.'

He calls the EU a unique political project that must be carried by the population. 'If that does not happen, we will see what we have built up fall apart.'

The interview is included in a report on the EU ahead of the European elections on Thursday. Others who are interviewed include former LPF party chairman Mat Herben and PVV MP Barry Madlener.

Altijd Wat is on Nederland 2 at 20.45. The European elections take place on Thursday.
