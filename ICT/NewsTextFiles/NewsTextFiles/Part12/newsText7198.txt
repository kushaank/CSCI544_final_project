
President Goodluck Jonathan held a meeting on Monday with security chiefs and heads of security agencies at the presidential villa, Abuja.

The meeting is coming after Saturday’s regional security meeting on Boko Haram hosted by French President Francois Hollande at Elysee Palace, Paris, France.

At the meeting, West African leaders discussed needed collaboration in the fight against the Boko Haram sect that has been terrorising villages in Nigeria’s north east.

Details of the security meeting were not known and the Security Chiefs also did not speak with journalists at the end of the meeting.

It is believed that apart from reviewing the security situation in the country, they may also have touched ongoing efforts to rescue the over 200 secondary schoolgirls abducted in Chibok, Borno State, over a month ago.
