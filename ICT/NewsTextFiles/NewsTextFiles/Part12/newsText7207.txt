Dozens of people packed into the Penn Yan Middle School Auditorium Monday night. Those in attendance have lost, or had serious damage, to their home or business. The damage is done and the meeting is about what's next. For many of these people, insurance won't cover the repairs.

Town, village and state officials shared what steps people can take to get low interest rate loans and how to get temporary items like furnaces and sump pumps.
