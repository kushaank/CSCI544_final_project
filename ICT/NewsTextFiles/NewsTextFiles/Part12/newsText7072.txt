
The fiasco continues.

So let’s dig in.

Far from “Jew hatred,” the Qur’an 2:63 repeatedly declares that the Jews shall attain eternal paradise. The Qur’an mentions Prophet Moses by name more than any other prophet—over 150 times— and Islam recognizes the Divine origin of the Torah and the Psalms of David. Prophet Muhammad’s benevolent treatment of Jews attracted their love for him. Safwaan bin Assal relates, “some people among the Jews kissed the hands and feet of the Prophetsa.” It is impossible to consider that a man could garner such love from his citizens with force or violence. Following this example, throughout Islamic history the Jews flourished under Muslim rule in parts of North Africa, Jerusalem, Persia, and Spain.

Thousands of Jews were murdered during the Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, and at various times in Europe and Russia. The word ghetto owes its origin to the slums of Venice where Jews lived. Father Charles Coughlin commanded a weekly radio audience of more than thirty million Americans in the 1930s and openly supported anti-Semitism, Adolf Hitler, and Benito Mussolini. And lest we forget, Hitler identified as Christian.

This allegation of Islamic Jew-hatred is dangerous because it is meritless, creates an irrational fear of Islam and of Muslims, and ignores the factually proven growing anti-Semitism in Europe and America. Per Islamic teaching, Prophet Muhammad treated Jews as equals and with compassion. So enough of these ridiculous bus ads—find something productive to spend your money on. Let’s stop blindly blaming Islam for anti-Semitism and instead work together to root out anti-Semitism wherever it exists.
