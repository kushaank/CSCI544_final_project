
The acquisition of Emerson’s Connectivity Solutions is a strategic move by Bel Fuse as the business complements the existing line of business of the latter. Through this acquisition, Bel Fuse intends to expand into the aerospace and military markets, where long-term product reliability through highly engineered solutions is an important factor.

Further, the addition of Connectivity Solutions’ Stratos brand to the Fibreco/Gigacom Interconnect products of Bel Fuse would give the latter an industry leading position in the Expanded Beam Fiber Optic market. Also, the ECS group will considerably expand Bel Fuse’s copper-based product offering with its RF/Microwave connectors and assemblies.

For Emerson, this divestiture is a viable option as connectivity solutions are not aligned with its long-term goals and strategies. Further, Emerson intends to use the deal proceeds for share repurchases in fiscal 2014.

Bel Fuse primarily engages in the design, manufacture and sale of products used in networking, telecommunications, high-speed data transmission, commercial aerospace, military, transportation, and consumer electronics. Emerson, on the other hand, is a global leader in technology and engineering, and provides innovative solutions for customers in industrial, commercial and consumer markets around the world.

Emerson currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
