The Google doodle honoring the Rubik's Cube.

In honor of the Rubik's Cube's 40th anniversary, Google has transformed its logo on search pages to a giant, playable version of the popular toy.

When a visitor clicks on the logo, the Rubik's Cube will spin and grow into an interactive version of the 3-D puzzle. Players click the mouse to twist horizontally, while clicking and dragging down twists vertically.

The puzzle was invented in 1974 by Hungarian architecture professor Erno Rubik. It was originally called the Magic Cube before being renamed after its creator. The puzzle reached its peak popularity in the '80s as a hot kids toy, with an estimated 350 million sold worldwide, according to the official Rubik's Cube website .
