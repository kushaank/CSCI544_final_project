The sounds and cries of Nigeria rang out in front of the state Capitol on Sunday as more than 100 protesters beseeched the world to aid their country in rescuing 276 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram, a group of Muslim extremists in northeastern Nigeria.

All we are say-ing  is bring back our girls, sang a chorus of Nigerians flanked by Liberians, Ghanians and African Americans. The crowd prayed, wept and demanded military help to find Boko Haram. The name of the group translates in Hausa to Western education is sinful and prohibited, explained Professor Ernest Uwazie, director of the Center For African Peace  andConflict Resolution at California State University, Sacramento.

Uwazie joined the Sacramento Association of Nigerians, representing some of the estimated 5,000 Nigerians in the region, in calling for aid to the families of the missing girls and other victims displaced by Boko Haram violence. They also urged international mediation to resolve the conflict.

The rally was the first of several planned in Sacramento to keep international attention on the brazen April 14 kidnapping, in which more than 300 girls ages 15 to 18 were seized from Government Secondary, a school in Chibok, Borno State, Uwazie said.

Aside from U.S. Marines and France, Germany, Israel and other nations joining in the international response, we call upon our ancestors to help Nigeria, said Chief Solu Atanda, a Sacramento resident who performed a traditional libation ceremony.

About 50 of the kidnapped girls managed to escape from the Sambisa Forest game reserve, a Boko Haram hideout. But some died of snake bites while getting away, said Uwazie, who is in contact with an adviser for Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan. Uwazie said he fears the rest of the girls may have been sold into slavery, prostitution, forced marriages or even for body parts in neighboring Chad, Cameroon and Niger.

Boko Haram sees any symbols of Western culture  whether education, Christianity or politics  as corrupt institutions, Uwazie said. It has demanded the release of anywhere from 500 to 1,000 Boko Haram members in government custody in exchange for the girls.

Many schools in impoverished northeastern Nigeria have been shut down by Boko Haram, which was founded in 2002 in Borno State and began pushing for the adoption of Shariah law instead of Nigerias British-style system of justice. Several months ago, Boko Haram killed about 50 teenage boys at a school, Uwazie said.

But others, noting that an estimated 2,000 people this year have died in Boko Haram violence, said the Nigerian government is overmatched by the group, which has been labeled a terrorist organization by the U.S. government.
