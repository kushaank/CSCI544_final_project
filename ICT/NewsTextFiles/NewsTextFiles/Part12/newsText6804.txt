
As part of the Blue Star Museum program, the National Mississippi River Museum and Aquarium in Dubuque will be offering free admission to active duty military personnel and their families this summer.

The offer extends from Saturday, May 24 through Labor Day, Sept. 1 and includes the National Guard and Reserves.

The Blue Star Museum program is a collaboration of the National Endowment for the Arts, Blue Star Families, the Department of Defense and more than 2,000 museums nationwide. The program is an effort to improve quality of life for active duty military families.

According to a press release from the National Mississippi River Museum and Aquarium, approximately one million children nationwide have at least one parent deployed. The Blue Star Museum program offers families a chance to visit museums this summer, when many of them will have limited resources and limited time together.
