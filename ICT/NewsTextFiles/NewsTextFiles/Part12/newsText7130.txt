
PETALING JAYA: An extensive bathymetric survey of the areas provided by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau will be carried out in the Southern Indian Ocean in the new phase of the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 plane.

Acting Transport Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein (pic) said a team of hydrographic experts from Malaysia, China and Australia, met over the weekend and agreed that the survey was needed.

"This survey will be conducted by the Chinese navy vessel Zhu Kezhen.

"The vessel is scheduled to sail for the survey area on Wednesday, weather permitting," he said in a statement Monday.

He added that a team of technical experts had convened in Canberra to discuss and refine the satellite data, calculations and analysis which have been made available by Inmarsat.

"In light of the recent demands by the next of kin for Inmarsat 'raw data', I have instructed the Malaysian Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) to discuss with Inmarsat on the release of the aforementioned data for public consumption," he said.

Hishammuddin lamented that it has been 73 days since the aircraft went missing, and that the new phase of search operations would begin.

"As we enter the tenth week of the search operations, we have now started moving into a new phase, which involves deep-sea search requiring specialized expertise and assets.

"Trust that all resources are being used to find MH370," he said.

Please wait.
