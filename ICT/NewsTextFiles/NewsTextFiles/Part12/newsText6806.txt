
Sub Lieutenant Sam Williams, 28, has dreamed of being a helicopter pilot in the Royal New Zealand Navy since he was six years old. His dream is becoming a reality as he gets ready to embark on the second stage of his pilot training course.

“I joined the Navy in 2011 with the goal of becoming a Seasprite pilot. In 2013 I went on the Air Force WINGS course and completed my primary training phase on the CT-4 Airtrainers.

“Currently I’m working in Naval Staff at Defence HQ in Wellington until October when I’ll start my advanced pilot training on the King Air aircraft,” said SLT Williams, a Wellington College old boy.

Once he completes his advanced training, SLT Williams will progress to the Helicopter Basic Course, then onto the Seasprites at 6 SQN at Whenuapai in approximately 2017.

Being the only Navy person in an Air Force course hasn’t been a problem for SLT Williams who says although there are slight differences in the culture of each service, being able to experience Air Force life is providing valuable experience.

“When I am a trained pilot and flying for Navy I expect that I will still have a lot to do with my course mates in Air Force as we work on various deployments and missions together.

“I’m really looking forward to seeing us all graduate in a few years knowing our hard work has been worth it,” said SLT Williams.

The pilot training course is difficult and those who graduate are the best of the best. For SLT Williams the highlight to date has been a week flying around the South Island.

Amidst the day-to-day reports about the military advances of the Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria, one remarkable aspect of this war has barely been mentioned.
