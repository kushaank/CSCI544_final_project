
BANGKOK: The People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC) on Tuesday abruptly cancelled plans for an extended street rally aimed at building momentum for yet another 'final battle' next week.

PDRC spokesman Akanat Promphan said that today's planned street march had ben called off. There were no plans to try to stage another protest.

The decision came after army chief Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha invoked martial law, effective at 3am today.

Meanwhile, Gen Prayuth ordered all government agency chiefs to report to the army this morning.

He said they must report to the Army Club on Vibhavadi Rangsit Road at 9am.

It was the first direct Army order after the declaration of martial law.

Military authorities also put an end to the Centre of the Administration of Peace and Order (Capo) set up by the caretaker government and run by Labour Minister Chalerm Yubamrung to maintain law and order.

Under the "second announcement" of the martial law order, which is not a coup, Gen Prayuth, the army chief, declared himself director of the PKCC.

The centre has almost identical duties to the Capo. It is "to be responsible for taking action to prevent and mitigate any situation which may affect peace and order and security" throughout the country, according to the accouncement.

The PKCC "is empowered to enforce all sections under the Martial Law Act" to try to quickly restore peace to the country.

It is also empowered to "invite individuals to report to authorities" [ie, detain] to testify or hand over documents and other evidence for use in peace-keeping operations.

Also under the order, the Capo was ordered to cease all operations, effective immediately.  All personnel, except those of the three armed forces, are to return to their original units.
