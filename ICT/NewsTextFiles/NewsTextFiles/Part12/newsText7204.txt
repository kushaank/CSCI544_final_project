Mr Winser, who has led many expeditions in Africa, Asia and in the Arab region, pointed out that the existence of institutions that provide support to scientific research has contributed to the development of Dubai while strengthening conservation and encouraging ecological diversity.

In terms of the initiatives and efforts of UAE and the Emirate of Dubai in the field of environmental protection, Mr Winser praised the efforts of various entities, particularly the role of Dubai Police in marine life protection.

During his visit, Mr Winser was impressed with the increasing biodiversity that has taken root in Dubai , and pointed out that there is much that the rest of the world can learn from Dubai ’s efforts to balance economic development with environmental sustainability.

“It is often thought that urban development destroys biodiversity. However, this need not be the case, as Dubai has shown. With the right support and conservation efforts, a wide range of plants and animals can prosper within changing circumstances,” Mr Winser said.
