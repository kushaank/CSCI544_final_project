
Veteran Congress leader and former Andhra Pradesh Governor, N D Tiwari who tied the knot with the mother of his biological son Rohit Shekhar on May 14 last, got his marriage registered at the registry office here.

The 89-year-old leader, who arrived at the registry office supported by his wife Ujjwala Sharma and staff members, completed all formalities related to the marriage to give it a legal status.

Tiwari had surprised everyone by marrying Sharma at a simple ceremony at his Mall Avenue residence here.

Tiwari was Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh thrice and Uttarakhand once. He was the Governor of Andhra Pradesh between 2007 to 2009, when his name figured in a sex scandal and he had to resign. He was also the External Affairs Minister in the Rajiv Gandhi's cabinet in 1980s.

Tiwari was earlier involved in a long legal battle to accept Ujjawla Sharma's son Rohit Shekhar as his biological son.

Meanwhile, Tiwari's wife Ujjwala Sharma slammed a section of media for levelling unfounded charges against her and her son with regard to her marriage.

"This is yellow journalism... I thought of taking action against such people, but have been advised against it by Tiwariji," she said. Sharma also accused certain people close to Tiwari of cheating him.
