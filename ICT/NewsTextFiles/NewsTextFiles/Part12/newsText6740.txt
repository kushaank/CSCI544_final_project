The law, signed on November 19 shortly before former mayor Michael Bloomberg finished his second term, had a six-month waiting period before it came into effect â€” but its impact can already be clearly felt. "Under 21, no tobacco," warned a small sign at a shop that sells smokes, newspapers, candy, coffee and cakes, in the Nolita neighbourhood.
