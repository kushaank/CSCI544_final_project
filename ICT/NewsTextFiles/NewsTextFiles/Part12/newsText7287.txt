
The McMillan family is selling its half stake in Auckland-based BMW, Mini and Roll Royce dealer Team McMillan to co-owner Collins Asset Management, and founder Bob McMillan will retire from the business.

Collins Asset Management's managing director Tim Cook said financial terms of the transaction, which is effective on June 30, were confidential. Team McMillan, based on Great South Road, is Auckland's largest BMW dealership and the European automaker's New Zealand 'sales dealer of the year' for the past two years.

Cook is already on the Team McMillan board. His firm's interests include 16 percent of NZX-listed Veritas Investments and held a 19.7 percent stake in juice maker Charlie's Group until it was sold to Asahi Group in 2011.
