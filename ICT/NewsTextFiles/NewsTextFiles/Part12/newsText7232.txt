
These are some of the question numerous Macedonian newspapers had considering the requirements of the embassy in a competition announced for granting financial assistance for new media in the country.

According to Vecer, the Dutch Embasy wants to finance and create a website whose main task will be to list all Macedonian media and who the editors are and their financiers. Such website already exists and this information is available via the Macedonia's State Registrar's website and the UJP. "The Dutch Embassy wants to essentially create parallel structures within Macedonia, have better control of the opposition and impose Brussel's will on Macedonia through pressure from their own 'media' " says "Vecer".
