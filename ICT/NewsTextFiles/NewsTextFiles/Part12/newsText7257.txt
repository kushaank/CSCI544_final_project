
When Jill Duggar traveled to Nepal, she didn't think she'd meet her future husband, but she did. Obviously with the blessing and grace of Jim, a devout Christian, Jill couldn't be happier with Derek's courtship-turned-engagement.

On May 20, 19 Kids and Counting's airing will feature back-to-back episodes called "Something New," and "Couples Weekend." Could this be an episode that will show Bob and Michelle in a vacation with the newly engaged Jill and Derick? It could be, since Jill and Derick have been spending time away from each other during the first stages of their engagement. Based on their Facebook photos, it seems that the couple is having the time of their lives, after officially announcing their engagement last month.

Jim has expressed his vote of confidence with Jill's choice to spend the rest of her life with Derick, since Derick's a good friend of Jim.

"You don't want to be too strict but you don't want to be too liberal either, just letting them do whatever," says Â Jim about the right balance of being a parent. At Jill's age, it's just right to let her do what she wants as long as she doesn't lose touch with her values and who she is.

Catch the back-to-back episodes of 19 Kids and Counting on TLC tonight.
