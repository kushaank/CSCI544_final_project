A Harrisburg auction house sold an album of rare photos of China dating to 1860 for $410,000 over the weekend.

Cordier Auctions & Appraisals sold the album, which includes 56 images of China during the Second Opium War in 1860, to Stephan Loewentheil, president of The 19th Century Rare Book and Photograph Shop . The shop has locations in Maryland and Brooklyn.

The album, on consignment with Cordier since March 12, sold during the auction house's Spring Antique & Fine Art Auction in Harrisburg. The seller has asked to remain anonymous, said Melanie Hartman, spokeswoman for Cordier.

Cordier saves high-ticket items for its spring and fall antique and art auctions, but Hartman said "items of this extraordinary value are extremely unusual."

Beato was able to capture the images as he accompanied the British army into China, Cordier said.

The photos detail strategic military positions, the landscape devastated by battle and buildings, including the Summer Palace, before they were decimated by the British, according to Cordier.
