NEW DELHI: Alleged specifications and pricing of the upgraded Surface Pro have now appeared online.

According to Windows Phone Central, Surface Pro 3 will be offered in five variants with different pricing and hardware configurations.

The base model with a 4th-generation Intel Core i3 processor, 4GB RAM and 64GB storage will be priced at $799 while the top-end variant of the tablet will be powered by a Core i7 processor, come with 8GB RAM and 512GB storage, and priced $1949. The website suggests that Surface 3 Pro will come with a larger screen (it hints at a 12-inch screen), and will come with a smaller bezel and new Type covers to fit the larger device. It adds that the Type covers will come in Black, Purple, Cyan, and Red colours.

No other details related to the tablet are available, right now. The Surface Pro 2 tablet starts at $899, with the base model featuring 4th-generation Intel Core i3 processor, 4GB RAM and 128GB storage.

Microsoft is hosting an event on May 20 and the tagline of the invitation is "Join us for a small gathering."

It's being speculated that the 'small' in the invite hints at the mini version of Surface tablet. A recent report said that Surface Mini will be launched in mid-May.

Surface Mini has been part of the rumour mill since last year, and is considered as Microsoft's attempt to lure corporate users away from Apple's iPad mini. It is expected to have a 7.5-inch screen with 1440x1080p resolution. It is speculated that Surface Mini will run on Windows 8.1 OS instead of Windows RT and is expected to be powered by an ARM chip. The tablet may feature 3G and 4G connectivity, which current Surface models do not have.
