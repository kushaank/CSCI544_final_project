
AUSTRALIA'S Indian summer continues to roll on with Melbourne equalling a May record for consecutive days of mild temperatures.

Temperatures in southeast Australia have hovered between three and six degrees above average since a slow-moving high pressure system in the Tasman Sea began on May 11.

In Melbourne, the temperature reached 20 degrees Celsius for the 10th day in a row on Tuesday, matching the 1972 record for consecutive days above 20C in May.

The record could still be broken outright on Wednesday.

Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Scott Williams said it was increasingly possible Melbourne's mild temperatures may linger on for another two days.

"Because this (cold) front is so weak, there is a chance we could break it," Mr Williams told AAP.

"There's at least a 50:50 chance that we'll break it outright tomorrow and again the next day so we extend it to 12 days."

But it's not only Melbourne experiencing a spell of warmer weather.

Adelaide has also basked in its 10th consecutive day above 20 degrees, but it is unlikely the record of 15 days will be threatened.

If the trend continues, Australia will be on track for its warmest May since 1958.
