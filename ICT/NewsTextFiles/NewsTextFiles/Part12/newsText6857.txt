Perkins was seriously injured following an incident at a Jordanian military base and was pronounced dead from a gunshot wound at King Hussein Hospital in Amman, Fort Carson officials said.

"Investigators are still trying to determine the details of the incident and what led to Spc. Perkins' death, but we can confirm that no Jordanians were involved," said spokeswoman Meghan Williams.

Perkins was assigned to the Mountain Post's 67th Armor Regiment in the 2nd Brigade Combat Team of the 4th Infantry Division, the statement released Monday read.

Perkins joined the Army in August 2012 and was assigned to Fort Carson in January 2013. The infantryman deployed to Jordan in October, according to Fort Carson officials.

During his time in active duty, Perkins was awarded the Army Achievement Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and the Army Service Ribbon.

The 2nd Brigade soldiers routinely travel throughout the Middle East training local troops, working in large part with the Jordanian Army, which is beefing up its force in a bid to keep the Syrian Civil War under control.
