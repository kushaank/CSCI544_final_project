
FORMER United Democratic Front activist and cabinet minister Valli Moosa, now chairman of Anglo Platinum (Amplats), says the debate about executive pay "has not fallen on deaf ears" and the board is "alive to the concerns being expressed in society".

Amplats CEO Chris Griffith stirred controversy last week when he publicly justified his R17.6m-a-year pay package in the midst of a strike by low-skilled employees earning R4,500 a month at entry level, and demanding R12,500. Mr Griffith’s package for last year included cash and payment in equity.

On Friday, Mr Griffith apologised to Amplats employees and the public, writing letters to several newspaper editors.

In his original comments on Wednesday, he asked: "Must I run this company and deal with all this nonsense for nothing? I’m at work. I am not on strike. I am not demanding to be paid what I am not worth."

In his brief apology, Mr Griffith says: "My choice of words was inappropriate and a poor way to describe the extremely challenging situation. … I want to reassure your readership that I care deeply about the impact of this strike on the lives of our employees …. However, Amcu’s demand for a minimum basic wage of R12,500 remains unaffordable as it would increase our costs by (about) R4.5bn per annum."

Mr Moosa commended Mr Griffith’s initiative. "The decision … to apologise was his and his only. He had called me only after he had taken the decision and then only to inform me that he was about to issue a public apology. I have always known him to be genuinely attuned to and sensitive to the views of stakeholders and the staff of Amplats. The board has full confidence in both Mr Griffith’s integrity and his capabilities. Among his peers globally, he is considered to be exceptional," he said.

Concern about executive remuneration was a global phenomenon. "Boards of large listed companies will be remiss to ignore the debate that is raging out there. I would like to assure you that in my case, this debate is not falling on deaf ears," Mr Moosa said in response to questions on Sunday.

The Amplats remuneration policy was endorsed as recently as last month at the company’s annual general meeting. The vote did not pass without criticism. Shareholder activist Theo Botha asked whether, at a time of weak platinum prices, it was appropriate to endorse "excessive remuneration".

Notwithstanding his formal apology, in an interview with Business Times on Sunday, Mr Griffith appeared to continue to dig himself into a hole, again citing market forces to justify the pay gap. "The debate around executive pay is one I’m never going to win, no matter where I go with it.

"I have never said the pay gap was fair. It is a reflection that pay is determined by the forces of supply and demand, of complexity, of expertise and responsibility that people at different levels of the organisation have," he said.

This time he stopped short of saying whether he was worth the money.

In his letter, Mr Griffith also apologises for "the seemingly insensitive timing of bonus scheme announcements" — necessitated by "JSE reporting regulations".
