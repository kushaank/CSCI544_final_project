
Washington, Rajab 20, 1435, May 19, 2014, SPA -- The U.S. government denounced the latest violence in Kidal, Mali, which has killed at least one government security official, injured civilians and U.N. peacekeepers, and resulted in the seizure of government buildings and the taking of hostages.

“We condemn these acts, which undermine the fragile peace in northern Mali and efforts to bring peace, security, and development to all of its citizens,” the State Department said in a statement late Sunday.

“We call for the immediate release of all hostages, and urge all parties to refrain from violence and from any acts that place civilians at risk.  The way to resolve these issues is through an inclusive and credible negotiation progress, not through violence and intimidation,” the department said.
