Samsungâ€™s sizable line-up of Galaxy tablets has just become a little larger with the launch on Friday of the Galaxy Tab 4 Education, essentially a modified version of its consumer-oriented Tab 4 device .

The $370 tablet, which was first announced back in January, is certainly a rugged-looking number which, with its chunky case and tough Corning Gorilla Glass, should be able to comfortably withstand all manner of classroom calamities.

Optional accessories include a USB keyboard, AllShare Cast for wireless mirroring of content to displays, and charging carts for easy classroom storage.

Integrating with Google Play for Education, the new device gives educators the opportunity to make the most of a varied selection of teacher-approved apps, books and videos aimed at providing students with a more stimulating learning experience.
