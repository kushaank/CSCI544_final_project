
International Sauvignon Blanc Day got off to a super start in Marlborough on Friday, with #SauvBlanc trending throughout the country before the official real-time event even got under way.

The online campaign, which encouraged people worldwide to participate in the Twitter conversation using #SauvBlanc, was paired with an event hosted by Wine Marlborough at Cloudy Bay Tree House, and aimed to raise the profile of sauvignon blanc - Marlborough's flagship wine.

Wine Marlborough general manager Marcus Pickens said it had been great fun to see momentum building on Twitter.

"No-one could contain their excitement. It was suppose to kick off at 1pm but [in the] morning it was just all go."

UK-based blogger Robert Giorgione, more commonly known as the Roving Sommelier, said he was pleased to be in Marlborough to celebrate savvy's special day.

"It's nice to be able to celebrate with the winemakers of Marlborough sauvignon."

Giorgione had not planned for his visit to coincide with the event but it was great that it did, he said. He arrived in Marlborough last Monday as part of a two-month tour of New Zealand.

"I always enjoy a good sauvignon blanc," he said. "Every year there is something new to discover."

Wine Spectator magazine senior editor and senior tasting co-ordinator MaryAnn Worobiec was also at the event.

Worobiec said her timing was also "a bit of a coincidence".

"I wanted to come after harvest so I wouldn't be interrupting anyone.

"It [the event] was a nice way to see a lot of the winemakers . . . there was so much energy in the room."

New Zealand sauvignon blanc had "really taken off" in the United States, she said.

"It's the fastest growing sales in the States at the moment . . . it's growing about 20 per cent a year."

She arrived in Marlborough last Tuesday and planned to stay in the region for 10 days before heading home to California.
