
Amsterdam hosted today a working meeting between Alexey Miller , Chairman of the Gazprom Management Committee and Andrey Kobolev, CEO of Naftogaz of Ukraine.

It was urged at the meeting that the Ukrainian party should settle the debt for Russian gas supplied in 2013 and 2014. The total debt has amounted to USD 3.508 billion, including March and April unpaid deliveries. As a result, Gazprom was forced to switch Ukraine to gas prepayment, in line with the existing gas supply contract. Gazprom will be delivering strictly prepaid amounts of gas to Ukraine, starting from June.
