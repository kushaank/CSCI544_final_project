Former congressman Asa Hutchinson and businessman Curtis Coleman are vying for the Republican spot in the November election for Arkansas Governor.  Hutchinson has led in the majority of polling.

On the Democratic side, former congressman Mike Ross is expected to defeat primary opponent Dr. Lynette Bryant.

Of the state's four federal congressional districts, two districts feature contested Republican races.  In District 2, which covers Little Rock and Central Arkansas, businessman French Hill, State Representative Ann Clemmer and consultant Colonel Conrad Reynolds are looking to make the November ballot. In District 4, which covers Hot Springs and most of the state's western half, businessman Tommy Moll faces off against State Representative Bruce Westerman.

It's expected more people will vote in the Republican primary than the Democratic primary for the first time in recent memory.  The Secretary of State's office has predicted 20 percent voter turnout.
