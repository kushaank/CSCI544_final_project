
Chinese smartphone maker announced today that will officially set foot in Malaysia tomorrow, when its flagship Mi 3 smartphone will go on sale via Xiaomi’s Mi.com/my website.

The 16GB version of the device will retail for RM889 (about $277) unlocked, and will ship with a brand new Malaysia-themed skin for its MIUI firmware. Singapore also got its own MIUI skin when Xiaomi launched the Redmi there earlier this year, so it looks like Mi fans can get excited for some “collect ‘em all” goodness as the company expands across Asia.

The company added that the Redmi 1s, the upgraded version of its low-mid tier smartphone, will make its way to the island country in a month’s time.
