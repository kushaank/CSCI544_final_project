Websites in the Fairfax Digital Network offer streaming video and audio in the Flash format. Streaming media allows you to watch video on a website as a continuous feed, as opposed to waiting for an entire audio or video file to download to your computer before you can use it.

To play a video or multimedia clip, you need to have the Flash player installed. You can download one for most systems (including Mac OS X) for free if one is not already installed on your system.

Our automated system will test your connection speed and send the best video stream so it plays smoothly and continuously.

Alternatively, you can manually choose the speed setting that corresponds most closely with your network connection. We produce clips in a range of speeds to deliver the best quality possible-- the better the quality the faster connection you'll need.
