
When ‘Winter’ set himself the challenge of visiting every Starbucks in the world, it looked to be an achievable ambition… albeit an utterly pointless one.

But after spending more than £100,000 on travelling the world in pursuit of his goal, the computer programmer has now admitted defeat.

The comic book-collecting Texan, who changed his name from Rafael Antonio Lozano Jr, began his mission in 1997 when the company had 1,500 branches.

He has valiantly tried to keep up with its rapid expansion by drinking caffeinated coffee in 11,676 outlets – once guzzling 29 cups in a single day.

With more stores opening every week, however, he has conceded he’s unlikely to see them all before he dies.

‘I do not expect to ever complete the project, as I have every reason to think that Starbucks will outlive me,’ he said.

Winter, from Houston, might already be said to have failed the challenge he set himself – because many Starbucks branches have opened and closed again before he had a chance to stop by.

The bachelor once learned that bosses were to shut 40 US outlets and went on a 40,000km (25,000-mile) trip to try to visit them all before it was too late.

He only ticks a shop off his list if he has sampled a caffeinated coffee there.

The Starbucks mission that has come to dominate his life evolved naturally after he developed a fondness for the brand and began seeking out its shops on trips.

A keen Scrabble player, he would combine his coffee-drinking excursions with competing in tournaments, going to concerts or sightseeing.

But the 42-year-old – who confesses to a ‘mild caffeine addiction’ – admitted the coffee had gradually taken over.

On one visit to Hawaii, he visited five Starbucks branches on three islands and never even went to the beach, staying for only 30 hours.

‘Pointless though it may be, a goal is a goal,’ he said.
