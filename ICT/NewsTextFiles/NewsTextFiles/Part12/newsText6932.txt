
A woman has told a court hearing the Rolf Harris sex assault trial that she thought she was going to be raped when the entertainer pinned her against a wall.

The 18-year-old, giving evidence at Southwark Crown Court, said it happened while she was on holiday in Malta in 1970.

Harris is alleged to have taken her into a side room, pinned her against a wall and kissed her while touching her intimately.

That was said to be after she went to thank the star for helping her boyfriend who had hurt his foot.

The woman said of the kiss: "It was quite slobbery. It wasn't very nice.

"I was quite shocked, more shocked than anything."

She told the jury at first she was "a bit flattered", and that after the alleged assault Harris "just stopped whatever he was doing and just cuddled me".

Prosecutor Sasha Wass QC asked her: "Did he say anything?"

She replied: "(He said) 'I'm sorry'."

The woman said she was "just in shock really, happy that was it. I thought I was going to be raped. I don't know what I thought really."

Harris, from Bray in Berkshire, is accused of 12 counts of indecent assault on four alleged victims between 1968 and 1986, all of which he denies.
