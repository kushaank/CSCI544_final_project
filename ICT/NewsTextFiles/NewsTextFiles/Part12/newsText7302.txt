
Muscat: The aviation sector in Oman is bracing for a big turnaround by readying the Muscat International and Salalah airports which represent a starting point for the real evolution of the aviation industry in the Sultanate, said Dr Ahmed bin Mohammed Al Futaisi, Minister of Transport and Communications.

Dr Al Futaisi stressed the government's keenness to sponsor and support the sector to enable it to play its role in the development process alongside other sectors.

The comments came during his visit to Oman Airports Management Co. (OAMC) where he was received by Dr Juma bin Ali Al Juma, OAMC chairman, and a number of other officials.

He commended the important role played by Oman Airports Management Co. in invigorating the aviation industry and projecting it among the worlds' top airports through the adoption of many ambitious plans and programmes, especially with regard to its readiness, employment and training of national cadres, as well as the incorporation of projects and ventures that upgrade the airport industry in Oman.

Dr Al Futaisi also hailed the company's steady movement towards readiness for the operation of Muscat International Airport (first phase) and Salalah Airport, with the completion of certain significant works by the executing firms.

He gave the credit to Omani officials who played a significant role in achieving this success. This, he said, inspires us with trust and confidence in the proficiency and ability of Omanis to manage the new airports.
