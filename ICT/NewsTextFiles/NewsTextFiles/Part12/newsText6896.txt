
Jammu, May 19: An army man was killed and two others were injured when militants triggered an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) explosion and fired from automatic weapons towards a patrol team along the Line of Control (LoC) in Akhnoor sector of Jammu province, an army official said.

“Militants targeted army patrol party along Jogwan forward belt in Akhnoor border area of Jammu district yesterday by triggering IED explosion. The militants had planted an IED near a track and triggered the blast to target the troops. The militants later fired on the security men triggering an encounter,” he said.

He said an army man was killed and two others injured in the ensuing firefight.

The deceased has been identified as Sepoy Bhikale. The two others injured are Vinod Kumar and Lance Naik Amol Kumar and they have been admitted to the military hospital, Northern Command for treatment.

“Search of the area yielded Pakistan made mines, and other equipment which clearly suggests involvement of Pakistan and militants from across the line of control,” an army spokesman said.

Meanwhile, army officials said Pakistani troops later resorted to brief firing on the forward border belt in Nathu Tibba area, triggering panic among the villagers. “The firing came to end last night”.

“An attempt by three Pakistani militants to sneak into Indian territory was yesterday foiled by the army, which also defused an IEDs planted by the infiltrators near a forward post in Bhimbher Gali belt of Rajouri district,” they said.

They said troops guarding the borderline fired on the infiltrating militants and they fled to Pakistan administered Kashmir (PaK).

Army officials said the ceasefire violations and firing by Pakistani troops were aimed at helping militants infiltrate into Jammu and Kashmir from the “launching pads” along LoC, where they are waiting to crossover.
