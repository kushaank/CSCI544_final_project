
Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) on Monday warned the new AT&T merger with DirecTV would likely hurt consumers.

Franken has also opposed the Comcast merger with Time Warner Cable announced in February.

During congressional hearings about that deal, Franken dismissed the companies' arguments that the deal would create more competition.

AT&T announced Sunday that it’s buying DirecTV for $48.5 billion. Comcast bought Time Warner Cable for $45 billion.

Franken on Monday rejected the notion that these mergers are inevitable but also suggested these decisions are ultimately not under Congress’s jurisdiction.
