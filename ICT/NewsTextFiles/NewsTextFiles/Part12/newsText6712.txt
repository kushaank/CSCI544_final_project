
The CM 11S ROM has three main "pillars" as far as its software features are concerned. They include a powerful theme engine, a new gallery app and a fresh camera app.

While the ROM does feature numerous other tweaks, it is not radically different from CM 11.

A part of the software that took over five months of work, the new Theme engine offers users a great deal of freedom when it comes to cosmetic customization. The new svelte customisation suite makes it rather easy for users to change the look and feel of their CM smartphones.

When they pick a theme for their devices, they can choose to activate only specific elements and effects, leaving out ones that they don't want to apply.

The new camera app has been designed with usability and functionality in mind. It features a host of manual controls and settings that can be tweaked and activated for a powerful camera experience.

The Gallery app group your pictures by location and time, organizing them into appropriate albums. It also has strong support for social media sharing, apart from a useful Dropbox backup function.
