A former Minister of Information and Communications, Prof. Dora Akunyili, sunday said God was answering the prayers of Nigerians for the healing of the ailment for which she is currently receiving treatment in an Indian hospital.

“I am comforted by the fact that prayers are going on for me in churches and mosques as well as in private homes. God is answering the prayers. He has already healed me. I am only waiting for the physical manifestation of the healing. I am grateful to all Nigerians. I look forward to recovering and coming back home to rejoice with you all,” Akunyili was quoted as saying by her Media Advisor, Mr. Isaac Umunna.

Umunna in a statement issued in Lagos said Akunyili spoke with him at exactly 2:14p.m.

“I had before now been speaking with her husband, Dr. Chike Akunyili, and her brother, Dr. Francis Anayo Edemobi, both of whom are with her in the hospital. The fact that Dora spoke by herself this afternoon confirms earlier reports that she is making appreciable recovery,” Umunna said.
