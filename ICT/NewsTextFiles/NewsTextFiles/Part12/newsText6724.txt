
MOSCOW, May 19. /ITAR-TASS/. Head of the group on monitoring human rights in Ukraine under the Presidential Council on Civil Society and Human Rights Maxim Shevchenko, who is negotiating the release of Russian journalists detained in Kramatorsk, told ITAR-TASS why LifeNews reporters are being held in Ukraine.

“They are accused of participating in interrogations of Alfa officers. The journalists allegedly asked them their own questions while they (Alfa officers) were interrogated with the use of force,” Shevchenko said. “I think that the interview was done by other journalists, not those detained now,” he added.  Shevchenko noted that it is “inadmissible” for journalists to participate in interrogations.

“The detained journalists will most likely face charges for participation in interrogations. We will insist on providing them with a lawyer. We will ask famous Kiev lawyers to defend them,” Shevchenko said.

He said that the release of the detained journalists will be most likely executed through a lawful procedure. “They are currently in the hands of the official Kiev authorities. We asked the authorities to let members of the Council meet them (journlaists), but there is no response yet,” Shevchenko added.
