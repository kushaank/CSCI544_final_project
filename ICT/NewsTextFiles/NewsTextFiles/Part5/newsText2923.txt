
COLUMBIA, Md., May 19, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, The Cleaning Authority announced the opening of its first office in Wrentham, Massachusetts serving all of Norfolk County.

The local office is owned and operated by Gulf War Veteran Paul Slaney and his wife JoAnn. "We are proud of our new business and very excited to be the first to bring The Cleaning Authority's many benefits to the residents of Massachusetts. With our strong business and customer service related backgrounds we knew this was the right opportunity for us. We are also proud to be a veteran owned and operated company and we were so pleased with the recognition we were given by The Cleaning Authority," Paul stated.

When asked what made The Cleaning Authority a good fit for him, Paul said "The Cleaning Authority has an established name with a solid reputation because of their exclusive Detail-Clean Rotation System. We were drawn to it because of the company's commitment to quality service and to using Green Seal Certified® housecleaning chemicals, and HEPA vacuums and microfibers. Perhaps one of the best parts of The Cleaning Authority franchise system is the training we received which we can pass on to our employees."
