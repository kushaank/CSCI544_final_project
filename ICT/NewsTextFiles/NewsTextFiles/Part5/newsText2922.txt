UNICAT's Terracross line, with six models to choose from 'are available to accommodate your personal ideas about travel,' according to the company's website.

The model displayed in the photos is the EX-63HD/MAN TGA 6x6 , which UNICAT describes as a 'machine [that] combines the rugged "go anywhere" off-road capabilities of the MAN 6x6 with the comforts of living at home. Safe 2 years of design, construction and testing. Built to the exacting standards of the world-class UNICAT engineering team, this "Home on Wheels" is virtually unused and is ready for your immediate occupancy.'
