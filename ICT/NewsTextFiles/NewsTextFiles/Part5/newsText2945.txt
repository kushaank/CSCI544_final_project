
MONTREAL -- The Montreal police bomb squad diffused 19 explosive devices after they were discovered Saturday at a home in Montreal’s north end.

Police told QMI Agency that an 18-year-old man was arrested and a computer as well as other communication devices were seized from his home.

The suspect is due to appear in a Montreal court on Tuesday.

“A call to 911 brought us to the address in question,” Montreal police spokesman Dany Richer said.

Once the explosives were discovered Saturday, police evacuated nearly 50 nearby homes.

The evacuees were not allowed back until Sunday morning. The Red Cross was on scene helping those who were displaced.

As of Sunday afternoon, the suspect was still being questioned by police.

Richer added that lawyers may ask for a psychic evaluation at Tuesday’s court hearing.

Perfect.
