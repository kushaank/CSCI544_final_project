
Kone, an international elevator and escalator firm that has an office in Allen, is growing and moving its operations in the Collin County community.

Kone is renting 25,000 square feet in a new office building to be constructed as part of an office park in the works near west Bethany and west McDermott drives. The company will also have a separate testing and research building.

Kone is now located on the other side of U.S. Highway 75 in the One Allen Center office building, which recently sold.

The elevator company will be a tenant in a 102,000-square-foot office building planned by partners Sentinel Capital, Centra Partners and Triad Real Estate.

“They are moving forward with the $26 million project,” Dan Bowman, interim head of the Allen Economic Development Corporation, said Monday.

Allen’s economic development corporation provided economic incentives for Kone’s new project, which will include a relocation of the testing facility now in McKinney.

Kone will be the first company to land in the planned AllenPlace business park.

Ben Appleby with Dallas-based Paladin Partners represented the developer in lease negotiations with Kone and is marketing the rest of the building – about 77,000 square feet of office space.

“The market here is very tight – it’s 95 percent leased,” Appleby said.
