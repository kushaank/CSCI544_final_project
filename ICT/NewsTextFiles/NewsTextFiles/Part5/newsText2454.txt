
Bermuda beat out competition from Switzerland to become the domicile of the first-ever African catastrophe insurance pool, Economic Development Minister Grant Gibbons told MPs.

And it is anticipated that the risk pool, which initially has five signed-up member countries, could add many more African nations over the next few years and could be a template for other programmes enabling badly needed insurance coverage in other parts of the developing world.

The ARC Insurance Company Ltd is a mutual insurance company established on the Island to provide drought coverage for Kenya, Mauritania, Mozambique, Niger and Senegal.

The company was set up by African Risk Capacity (ARC), a specialised agency set up by the African Union to help member states become more financially resilient to extreme weather events and to protect insecure food supplies. The capital � around $200 million according to an ARC statement � was provided by the governments of the UK and Germany.

Dr Gibbons revealed in the House of Assembly on Friday that ARC officials had visited Bermuda several times during the past 18 months, for talks with himself and financial regulator the Bermuda Monetary Authority. Marsh IAS, the insurance manager in Bermuda, Willis Group as reinsurance broker, and Appleby Bermuda, who assisted with ARC Ltd�s incorporation, are among others involved with the new company.

�Bermuda�s participation in this co-operative approach to assisting African countries is a strong vote of confidence for our country,� Dr Gibbons said. �Not only will ARC Insurance Company be domiciled here, but our involvement in the development of mutual insurance to assist African countries will provide targeted responses to disasters in a more timely, cost-effective and transparent manner.

The insurance policies issued this month by ARC Ltd will provide a total of approximately $135 million in drought insurance coverage tailored to the specific requirements of the insured countries. In addition to its own capital, ARC Ltd has secured US $55 million of capacity from the international reinsurance and weather risk markets in order to cover the risks it is taking on from the participating countries.

The calculation of claims to the programme is based upon satellite rainfall data which is used to objectively determine whether a drought has occurred. This then allows claims to be calculated quickly, and as a result, funds can be deployed in a timely and efficient manner.

David Simmons, managing director of analytics at Willis Re, who has worked with the ARC Ltd project, told The Royal Gazette it had the potential to be replicated for other developing countries.

�The ARC could be seen as a template to be used outside Africa,� he said. �The programme is very, very smart. It has involved engaging the countries to better understand their own cash crop and how it responds to different levels of rainfall. So the insurance is not the only benefit � there�s also greater understanding of risk.

Mr Simmons added that it was his understanding that the ARC hoped to get another 20 African countries signed up to the programme over the next three to four years.

The ARC Agency said the new insurance pool would make disaster-stricken African countries less reliant on international aid and also avoid the scenario of having to divert funds from important development projects to deal with an immediate crisis.

Henry Rotich, Kenya�s Cabinet Secretary for the National Treasury, said: �Droughts undermine our hard-won development gains, just as Africa is beginning to realise its vast potential.

Nigeria�s Finance Minister Okojo Iweala, chairman of the ARC Agency Board, described the formation of the Bermuda-based catastrophe insurance pool as �a transformative moment in our efforts to take ownership and use aid more effectively.

Mr Simmons said it was not the amount of money the programme could dispatch to a country in need that was most important, rather the speed with which claims were paid.

He explained: �Say you are a farmer in Niger and an event happens. Over time your crop will fail. Then you�ll sell your seed crop because you need the money. Then you sell your animals and then your tools. So the next year, you�re in a worse position and recovery from the event takes much longer.
