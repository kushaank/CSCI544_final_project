The Franklin County Board of Commissioners on Monday discuss the possibility of establishing a City of Ottawa and Franklin County joint summit to formally explore the goals of each entity.

Don Stottlemire, commissioner, voiced support for expanding the scope of the discussion to include officials from the other cities in the county, since he represents communities other than Ottawa, he said.

The county and City of Ottawa have the most to discuss, Lisa Johnson, county administrator, said, leaving the door open for separate meetings with officials from other communities. A conversation between the county and it’s largest city would help build collaboration on a variety of projects, including existing ventures like the 911 dispatch center, where Johnson noted room for relationship growth exists.
