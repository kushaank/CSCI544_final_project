
This man just kills me every time. He’s so beautiful…and perfect!

2PM‘s Nichkhun travels all the way to Switzerland to indulge in the country’s natural beauty for the June 2014 issue of Allure Korea magazine. The pictorial is part of the magazine’s Swiss Travel Pictorial “To Go Alone in the Europe Wave.” He traveled to St. Gallen in Switzerland, Lugano and Ascona, and poses in an exotic and breathtaking landscape.

After receiving permission from the UNESCO World Heritage site, Nichkhun and Allure were also able to go into the Abbey of St. Gall library and stand amongst all the beautiful books and artwork.

Even though I’ve been to a lot of foreign countries, I’ve never been able to truly feel the country’s culture, such as its food. I would always just go straight to the hotel and then the concert arena. But this time, I was able to feel Switzerland’s food and culture a lot. I think Switzerland’s cities are all pretty in a different way. I think the time I spent there and the landscape I saw will remain in my memory.

I like being able to rest at a beach and being able to tan, but I sometimes want to travel around without a map. If I’m in a place like Switzerland, I go all the way to the end. All the members like traveling, but Jun.K and Taecyeon seem to enjoy it the most. Taecyeon once bought an economy plane ticket by himself to travel to Rome, Italy. I want to go backpacking in Europe, too. Instead of going around famous and popular places based from the Internet, it’s my dream to go anywhere and just talk to people.
