
Kiama Municipal Council's new network of 20 CCTV cameras planned for Kiama's central business district is due to be in place by September.

In March, a council survey found 72 per cent of the Kiama community supported the installation of CCTV.

The project had already received $130,000 from the NSW government and the council, with the federal government committing a further $150,000 in the next financial year.

The challenge of making the 20 stand-alone cameras blend in with the picturesque Kiama streetscape has also been raised.

Kiama council's manager of community and cultural development Nick Guggisberg said the council did not want the cameras to have a negative impact on the streetscape, but at the same time the visual presence of the cameras needed to act as a deterrent.

Plans are underway to install CCTV cameras in Kiama sometime in September.
