
SEOUL, May 20 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's mobile carriers resumed full operations Tuesday, commencing another round of battle to recoup subscribers after the end of business suspensions that started in March.

The Korea Communications Commission (KCC) banned the carriers in turns from signing on new subscribers for 45 days starting March 13 as punishment for providing illegal incentives to induce users to change their service providers.

SK Telecom Co., the No. 1 player, was suspended from April 5 to May 19, while its smaller rival KT was ordered to close its doors from March 13 to April 26. LG Uplus, the smallest of the three carriers, stopped its operation from March 13 to April 4 and from April 27 to May 18.

Following the suspension, KT's market share in the mobile sector fell below the 30 percent mark for the first time in more than 10 years, the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning data showed.

SK Telecom garnered 50.42 percent in the same period, while LG Uplus Corp. held 19.72 percent, indication the competitors took KT's clients during the suspension.

The carriers reopened with aggressive new offers to make up for the lost business.

SK was selling a service package that provides discounts for family-unit subscribers, while lowering the price of Pantech Co.'s Vega Secret Up. It said it is currently in talks with manufacturers for further price cuts in smartphones.

LG Uplus, which restarted its full operation Monday, slashed the price tags on major smartphone models, including LG Electronics Inc.'s G2 and Samsung Electronics Co.'s  Galaxy S4 LTE-A.

KT, struggling to recoup its subscribers lost over the business suspension, was reducing the mandatory subscription term for existing clients to allow them to buy new devices.

The KCC said its will continue its surveillance of the mobile carriers to root out any illegal incentives amid signs that the market was overheating again.
