The superintendent of Canadian Valley Technology Center was honored by the Oklahoma School Public Relations Association.

YUKON – Canadian Valley Technology Center’s Greg Winters has been named superintendent of the year by the Oklahoma School Public Relations Association.

Winters, of Piedmont, chairs the Oklahoma CareerTech state marketing committee and has been an active supporter of communications and marketing efforts throughout the state. Winters is completing his 39th year in education.

He has been CV Tech’s superintendent the past six years and is one of only two to have served as superintendent at three different technology center districts.

Following the May 31 tornado that destroyed Canadian Valley’s El Reno campus, Winters led the charge to relocate 19 full-time programs, several dozen short-term courses, and 130 faculty and staff. School started on time just 75 days after the storm.

The El Reno campus will be rebuilt over much of the next two years with an anticipated fall 2016 grand re-opening. Only the school’s Business and Industry Services division could relocate to the El Reno site just a few months after the storm.

Bill Kramer is communications and marketing coordinator for Canadian Valley Technology Center.
