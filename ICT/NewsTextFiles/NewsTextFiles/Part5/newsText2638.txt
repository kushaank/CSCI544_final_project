
Business Leader Magazine is hosting a debate focusing on mergers and acquisitions tomorrow.

With the economy picking up, the debate will look at how businesses can best take advantage of growth.

What makes a successful acquisition; merging with a business outside of the UK; and how to fund m&a will also be discussed.

Pfizer’s proposed takeover of AstraZeneca will also be under the spotlight, with attendees being asked whether m&a is viable for SME businesses.

Subway, Lloyds Bank, HSBC, BDO, Grant Thornton, Odessey Corporate Finace, Shaw and Co LLP and many others will be attendance.

The debate is taking place at the Marriot on College Green in Bristol from 8am until 10.30am.
