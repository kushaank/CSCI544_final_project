
Jacob Ostreicher on Sunday appeared with actor Sean Penn for the first time since his release from a Bolivian jail. Presenting Penn the Champion of Jewish Justice Award at the Second Annual Champions of Jewish Values International Awards Gala in New York Sunday evening, “Yanky” Ostriecher described his prison ordeal and showered words of praise on Penn, who actively sought his release.

“This is not the story you expected to hear about the anti-American, Jew-hating, communist-loving Sean Penn,” Ostriecher told the crowd of 700.

“Not only was I the only Jew, I was the only American. I didn’t speak a word Spanish, all my possessions were stolen from me, I was in prison for a crime I didn’t commit and worst of all I was away from my family and loved ones.

Ostreicher went on to thank “two people that I know who they are” who rescued him from captivity.

“Sean sat with me for hours, sometimes sit with me all night, saying quietly ‘stay strong, Jacob, giver yourself some time.’ And more than just staying with me, he helped me start reconnecting with my family. . He gave me his white shirt, black suit and black shoes.” He then spoke of the first time he reconnected with his daughter and grandchildren.

“I would like to say everything is fine, No! I still have a long way to go. From time to time freedom and liberty continues to overwhelm me, but that’s the story… one of the best stories,” Ostreicher concluded.

“I saved Jacob Ostreicher because we are obligated to do so,” Penn said in his speech.
