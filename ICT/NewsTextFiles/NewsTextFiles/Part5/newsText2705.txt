
Harrison Greene is a 17,000-square-foot retail development at the intersection of Harrison Avenue and Westwood Northern Boulevard.

Recent marketing materials for Harrison Greene include Cincinnati-based Tom + Chee and breakfast/lunch eatery First Watch. Marketing materials often serve as a wish list of tenants for a development and donâ€™t necessarily mean a restaurant or retailer has signed a letter of intent or lease.

Neyer Properties marketing associate Amanda Neyer told me on Monday that no leases have been signed yet, but the developer anticipates action on that front in the next two to three weeks.

Floor plans for Harrison Greene show three other available spaces between potential spaces for Deweyâ€™s and Graeterâ€™s . Each is 1,418 square feet. Thereâ€™s also an office building proposed for the site, behind the retail center.
