
Two business partners were charged Monday with pocketing nearly $275,000 in payroll deductions intended to cover health care, dues and pension benefits for their union workers at their two companies in Chester Township.

John M. Parks, 69, of the 3400 block of Turnberry Court in Bethel, and Donald Kirk, 66, of the 200 block of Perry Street in Cape May, N.J., are facing multiple counts of theft and receiving stolen property offenses, all third-degree felonies, for withholding and then converting for their own use, deductions from more than 20 employees, all members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 654, over six months in 2011.

The defendants co-owned Rite-Way Electric, which ceased operations in late 2011, as well as Rite-Way Construction, which was forced into involuntary bankruptcy in 2012. Both businesses were located in the Bridgewater Business Park.

The arrests resulted from an extensive investigation launched by Detective Matthew Cresta and Detective Lt. Charles List, of the Delaware County Criminal Investigation Division�s Economic Crimes Unit, in April 2012.

Cresta and List met with IBEW Local 654 Assistant Business Manager Kevin Hassett on April 10, 2012. At that time, Hassett indicated that IBEW had represented employees for Rite-Way Electric and Rite-Way Construction since Rite-Way�s inception.

The exact relationship between the businesses, as well as authenticity regarding the newer construction business, were not immediately known.

As per an agreement with the IBEW, Hassett said monthly payroll deductions were made from the union workers� paychecks to cover health and welfare, pension, union dues, and apprentice training dues, and that Rite-Way Electric would submit a monthly report calculating the overall payroll deductions for that period. On average, the deductions totaled about $45,000 to $55,000 per month, he told investigators, according to the affidavit.

Hassett told the investigators the total monthly deductions were collected and sent via check to the union by the middle of the following month. At that point, the union broke down the payments and distributed the correct amounts to the employee accounts.

According to the affidavit, Rite-Way Electric closed shop at the end of 2011; however, for six months of operation during 2011, Rite-Way Electric documents indicate it withheld deductions from workers� pay, totaling $274,900.12. Those funds, however, were never forwarded to the union to be disbursed to individual accounts, the affidavit states.

The months in question are March, June, August, September, October and November 2011.

In December 2011, IBEW 645 filed for involuntary bankruptcy against Rite-Way Electric. The bankruptcy proceedings resulted in the release of all corporate financial records to the union, including bank statements for four accounts, one at MidCoast and three at Artisans� banks.

�For every month that (Rite-Way Electric) did not cover the payroll deductions to the union, except October 2011, there was sufficient amount of combined (Rite-Way Electric) capital to cover these employees deductions,� the affidavit states.

According to the affidavit, in August 2011, during the period that Rite-Way Electric collected the deductions, the co-owners of the company opened an account with $500 for Kirk Parks Enterprises at MidCoast Bank. Kirk Parks Enterprises was the real estate arm of Rite-Way Electric, and served as the property management for the Rite-Way Electric facilities.

For three months, there was no activity on the MidCoast account. Then in November 2011, a $30,000 Rite-Way Electric check was deposited into the Kirk Parks Enterprises account, the affidavit states. In December, 10 more checks were deposited into the account, totaling $72,084.97.

According to the affidavit, each of those checks were written to Rite-Way Electric, but deposited to the Kirk Parks Enterprises account. And between December 2011 and January 2012, $102,584.27 was withdrawn from the MidCoast account.

The MidCoast account balance as of February 2012 was $11,868.99. According to the affidavit, it was at that time that Kirk and Parks each received a $5,938 check, leaving a balance of $8.99.

Investigators met again with Hassett in April 2013, at which time Hassett provided additional documentation.

According to the affidavit, search warrants were executed for pertinent Artisans� Bank records in Delaware. As a result, investigators were able to confirm figures represented by the financial documents provided to the union at a bankruptcy and used to determine account balances for the six months in question.

Based on an analysis by CID, it was determined that in 2011, Rite-Way Electric paid a weekly rent payment of $5,354 to Kirk Parks Enterprises� Artisans� account. And based on Kirk Parks Enterprises records from January 2011 through November 2011, rent was paid in full. Also, the mortgage payment for the Kirk Parks Enterprises site was $6,899 monthly, and payments appeared to be current at that time.

Also, according to the affidavit, during this same period, Kirks and Parks also consistently paid themselves a Kirk Parks Enterprises weekly salary of $1,750.

At a civil 341 Meeting of the Creditors as part of the bankruptcy proceedings, Kirk testified that in November 2011, a $30,000 payment made from Rite-Way Electric to Kirk Parks Enterprises was for �back� rent payments, according to the affidavit. Not only did bank records show no shortage of rent payments to Kirk Parks Enterprises, the $30,000 was not deposited into the �rent� account as typically specified.

The $30,000 was instead deposited into the MidCoast Bank account, the affidavit states.

As part of the investigation, detectives made a general comparison of two five-pay period months for the 2011 calendar year, using February and November.

In February 2011, Kirk was paid a total of $10,544.54 from Rite-Way Electric and $4,750 from Kirk Parks Enterprises, for a combined monthly salary of $15,294.54. That same month, Parks was paid $10,542.45 from Rite-Way Electric and $4,750 from Kirk Parks Enterprises, totaling $15,292.45.

In November, Kirk was paid $14,251.20 from Rite-Way Electric and $4,750 from Kirk Parks Enterprises, totaling $19,001.20. That same month, Parks was paid $15,382.78 from Rite-Way Electric and $4,750 from Kirk Parks Enterprises, totaling $20,132.78.

As owners of a company that could not meet its financial obligations to employees, Kirk�s and Parks� salaries in November, the last full month of Rite-Way Electric operations, were more than at the beginning of the year when the IBEW payments were missed � Kirk earning an additional $3,706.66 and Parks earning an additional $4,840.33, the affidavit states.

According to the affidavit, Kirk withdrew $25,000 cash from a Rite-Way Electric Artisans� Bank account in October 2011. And on Nov. 18, 2011, he wrote himself a check in the amount of $50,000 from the same account, and that check was signed and deposited into a personal PNC Bank account.

At the 341 Meeting during bankruptcy proceedings, Kirk testified he did not know anything about the transaction.

Kirk also testified that the last day of business for Rite-Way Electric was Nov. 30, 2011.

According to the affidavit, Kirk and Parks sold company vehicles in December 2011, the same month that $74,754.02 worth of Rite-Way Electric receivables was deposited into the Kirk Parks Enterprises MidCoast account.

But when asked in court, Kirk said that Rite-Way Electric and Kirk Parks Enterprises monies were never commingled, the affidavit states.

Parks and Kirk are free on $75,000 unsecured bail, after a preliminary arraignment before Magisterial District Judge Deborah Krull.

Preliminary hearings are scheduled for June 12 in Brookhaven District Court.
