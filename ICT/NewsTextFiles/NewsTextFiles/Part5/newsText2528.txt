
Beef shipped to Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri and Ohio was recalled for possible E. coli contamination.

Wolverine Packing Company, based in Detroit, is announcing the recall of about 1.8 million pounds of beef products. The items were for restaurants in Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri and Ohio, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service.

The meat has been linked to 11 cases of E. coli in four states that remain unnamed. The bacteria leads to bloody diarrhea, dehydration and abdominal cramps. The products were produced between March 31 and April 18.

All of the recalled products are listed under the establishment number: EST. 2574B.

The U.S.D.A. first learned about the illnesses on May 12 and teamed up with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to link the beef to Wolverine Packing Company.

Want to reduce your risk for E. coli poisoning? Make sure your meat is well cooked. Ask the server for burgers cooked to 160 degrees, specifically, said Ben Chapman , a food safety professor at North Carolina State University. Just specifying “medium well” could get you anything from 145 degrees to 170 degrees.

Good news for kids, though: Federal inspectors say that none of the potentially contaminated beef was shipped to the National School Lunch Program, the U.S. Department of Defense, or for catalog and online sales.
