
The 2014 Beef Feedlot Roundtables from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln are available online as webinars.

Beef feedlot managers, owners, employees and supporting industry personnel attended presentations for the latest in feedlot health, nutrition, environment and economics. The Roundtables were offered in Nebraska with 6 remote links to sites in Iowa with Iowa State University Extension. Selected topics and speakers were recorded as webinars for those that were unable to attend. This month we will highlight presentations from Amy Schmidt and Dr. Dustin Loy. The links to their webinars are below.
