
The bullets shattered the front door windows of Bank of America's Stony Island branch on the 1600 block of East 95th Street. The intended targets talk to NBC 5's Dick Johnson.

Police believe bullets that shattered the front door windows of a South Side bank Monday afternoon were the result of unrelated gang gunfire.

The shooting happened outside the Stony Island branch, on the 1600 block of East 95th Street, police said.

A bullet-riddled car crashed into a median in the parking lot of the bank. The occupants of the vehicle say they were chased and shot at by individuals in another car.

One of the intended targets described the altercation between the two groups as "some old rival stuff that's been going on for years."

Police tape surrounded the bank's shattered windows and the bank was closed to patrons. People pulling up to the branch told NBCÂ 5 they were surprised something like this would happen at an otherwise quiet bank.

No injuries were reported.
