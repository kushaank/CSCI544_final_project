
UFC superstar MauricioÂ "Shogun" Rua was robbed at gunpoint during a recent trip to Brazil, where he was robbed of his car, cash and clothes.

According to MMAFighting.com , the MMA legend's manager Eduardo Alonso said Rua was driving back to his hotel following a dinner with his sponsors when he was stopped by four armed men.

"They took his clothes, money and his friend's car," Alonso said. "They said 'I know who you are, you're a fighter. Don't try anything.' It was a sad situation.

"They took everything, even his shirt. He was shoeless and shirtless. Imagine a guy at his size asking for a ride in the middle of the night."

Furthermore, he added that no one helped. "Nobody stopped to help him. He had to walk one mile to get to the police station. It was tense, but it's all good now."
