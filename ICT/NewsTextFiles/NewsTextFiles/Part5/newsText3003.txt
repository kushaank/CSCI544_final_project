
TORONTO -- The Ontario election campaign has more than three weeks to go but it has already taken a turn down a dark street.

The tone has become increasingly negative as the three major parties fight it out in the lead-up to the June 12 vote.

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath's campaign previewed a new ad Sunday that says Liberal Leader Kathleen Wynne has a "record of mismanagement" and her government is responsible for the costly eHealth, Ornge air ambulance and cancelled gas plants scandals.

"Put the Liberals in the penalty box," the ad recommends to voters.

The Liberals have already shown the media their own negative ad, which asks if Horwath "is for real," and blames her for rejecting the government's budget and giving PC Leader Tim Hudak a chance at the premier's office.

In Mississauga Sunday for a charity run, Wynne said she set a positive tone with her "running" ads and she would not describe her campaign as negative.

The Liberal plan, laid out in the May 1 provincial budget, is to invest in people through educational opportunities, build needed infrastructure such as transit, and partner with businesses to create jobs, she said.

"I believe that it is very important that as we go through an election campaign, we make it clear what we stand for and then we make it clear how we're different from everyone else," Wynne said. "That's not personal attack. That is a clear statement of who we are and how we differ."

NDP MPP Jagmeet Singh said Wynne's ads are clearly an attack on the NDP.

The Liberal messages about the NDP refer to the party's record two decades ago, a "grasping" attempt to make the party and leader look bad, Singh said.

Asked if the NDP video is also an attack ad, Singh said the party is attempting to show voters why it couldn't support the Liberal budget, that Wynne couldn't be trusted to keep the promises in that fiscal plan.

"I think the public needs to know that," Singh said.

Meanwhile, the Ontario Tories say they plan to set an optimistic tone with their own advertising and Hudak accused Wynne of angry messaging.

The PCs did not shy away from attack ads prior to the election call, including online videos that mocked Wynne's running ad.

Ontarians who wish to see all the political advertising immediately will have to turn to party websites or other online sources because election advertising can't legally be aired on television or in print until May 21.
