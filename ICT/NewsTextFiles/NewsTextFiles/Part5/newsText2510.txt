PANAMA CITY — Bay County commissioners are slated Tuesday to modify its scooter and moped rental ordinance to comply with regulations recently adopted by Panama City Beach.

Panama City Beach passed an ordinance May 8 requiring scooter riders to wear a reflective vest and carry safety brochures. Companies are also required to outfit scooters with a flag to increase visibility.

Although there is only one scooter renter in unincorporated Bay County, California Cycles located near the Panama City Beach city limits, Commissioner Mike Thomas said the idea behind a similar county ordinance is to keep regulations as uniform as possible to benefit law enforcement and show solidarity with Panama City Beach.

The ordinance does not relate to the county’s requirement of $1 million general insurance policy scooter and moped renters in unincorporated Bay County.

There is also an amendment to Bay County land development regulations on the agenda. The amendment would change Bay County’s regulations to match a Florida statute that would allow developers to gather a county permit while also obtaining permits from other government agencies. Bay County previously had required developers to have federal and state permits first before issuing a county permit.

Both Dozier and Thomas said this makes sense for business development.
