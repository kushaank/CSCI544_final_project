
Corrie Van Sice, a national thought leader in 3D printing, biotechnology and innovation culture, will share her perspectives in Chattanooga on June 3 at The Church on Main. The event will take place from 6 – 9 p.m. Her discussion will highlight the intellectual trade grounds emerging around 3D printing, as well as the changing landscape of engineering innovation.

The event is the first installment of the Chattanooga Spirit Series, a string of speaking engagements that will feature national voices on topics that highlight emerging innovation opportunities in Chattanooga. Sponsored by the Benwood Foundation, the Chattanooga Spirit Series is meant to inspire a shared exploration into areas of growing potential for the community.

The series is hosted by The Company Lab, The Enterprise Center, Lamp Post Group and SwiftWing Ventures.

"Ms. Van Sice is widely-recognized for blending 3D printing with applications in materials engineering, biotechnology and the arts. She regularly partners with researchers, engineers, artists and designers across the globe to develop new, interdisciplinary-oriented technologies and processes. Her perspectives on the future of materials manufacturing, the changing culture of making things and the role of community in research and innovation have distinguished her as a much sought-after voice on a number of emergent topics in science and technology." officials said.

While in Chattanooga, Ms. Van Sice will spend time mentoring the startups participating in CO.LAB’s GIGTANK program. As America’s first startup accelerator for the 3D printing industry, GIGTANK is currently supporting seven teams of entrepreneurs who are developing applications in 3D printing.
