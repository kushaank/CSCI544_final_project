
Gasoline prices in Florida continue to decline as a result of sufficient crude oil supplies along the Gulf Coast, AAA officials said.

However, prices haven't dropped further because demand has reached its highest level since 2009, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.

The national average for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline fell by a penny from the prior week to $3.65 per gallon. The average price in Florida dropped 3 cents per gallon last week to $3.64, AAA said.

A year ago, the price in Florida was $3.47 per gallon and $3.62 nationally.

"AAA has forecast gas prices to be at or near last year's levels during the Memorial Day holiday weekend," said Mark Jenkins, spokesman for AAAâ€”The Auto Club Group. "However, the margins of decline have been modest in the past week and prices could be slightly higher than a year ago. Even still, gas prices at these levels are not enough to keep people from traveling during the holiday."

More than 31.8 million Americans will fill their gas tanks and take a trip of 50 miles or more this Memorial Day weekend, AAA said.
