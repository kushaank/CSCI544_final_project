
Some 1,300 cabin crew at Norwegian Air, Europe's third-biggest budget airline, will not go on strike after a union and the company struck a deal, the parties said on Monday.

In addition to pensions, the main contention was the airline's decision to move its Norwegian and Danish cabin crew members into separate subsidiaries, which unions said reduced their bargaining power.

"It is clearly positive that the company has avoided a full-scale strike," said Kenneth Sivertsen, an analyst at Oslo-based brokerage Arctic Securities. "The strike was acting as a dampener on bookings."

At first glance it would appear Norwegian Air had been able to reach an agreement which was not too costly for the company, Sivertsen said. "The most important thing was to keep working conditions at a reasonable and competitive level, and it looks like Norwegian Air has done that. So they will be able to grow in Europe," he said.

The Parat union, which said the deal was reached overnight on Sunday, said it achieved some of its results, including collective pay agreements that are similar in both Norway and Denmark. It also got more say for employees on their pensions.

However the union and company will go to court over what the union described in a statement as unauthorized changes to cabin staff pension schemes.

Norwegian Air welcomed the agreement. "It is good we reached a deal and that we can look forward," chief executive Bjoern Kjos said in a statement.
