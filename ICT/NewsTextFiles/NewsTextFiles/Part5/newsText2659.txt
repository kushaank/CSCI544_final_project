
   Four Felony Lane suspects are arrested for more than 20 north central florida burglaries. GTN's Hailey Holloway has more on the string of crimes across two counties. It started last Tuesday with 10 car burglaries in Newberry and Jonesville. The Alachua County Sheriff's Office called Ocala PD to give them a heads up that the crimes could spread down I-75,  and sure enough, 3 different Ocala spots were hit the next day.

    "This Ocala YMCA parking lot is just one of the places the suspects burglarized 16 cars on Wednesday. They smashed the windows looking for wallets and stealing credit cards, IDs and checks before heading to the bank."

   "A lot of the definition has to do with the lane they use in the drive thru. They tend to try to pick the farthest lane or the most obscure lane so they are less visible to the tellers. The process then is to use the person's ID and either check or card to try to get money."

   That's exactly what happened Wednesday. OPD says they were notified by local banks about the attempted fraud. They also had ASO's information on the suspected cars and officers were able to make four arrests. Law enforcement says all of the burglaries were preventable.

   "The most important thing is that if these items were not there and they were not in plain view there would be no reason for these people to break into the victims cars."

   One of the suspects tried to run from police but a passerby tackled him and then police cuffed him.
