
Another major Auckland car dealership has changed hands with the McMillan family selling its 50% shareholding in Team McMillan to co-owner Collins Asset Management.

Collins, whose managing director is Auckland investor Tim Cook, has been a 50% shareholder for seven years in the company, which retails BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce cars. The transaction, which was not disclosed, take effect on June 30.

Mr Cook is already on the Team McMillan board. Collins' other interests include 16% of NZX-listed Veritas Investments and held a 19.7% stake in juice maker Charlie's Group until it was sold to Asahi Group in 2011.

The latest move coincides with the retirement of Bob McMillan, who says at 72 he has had “petrol running through my veins” for 52 years.

“I believe it is the right time for me to be getting out of the driver’s seat and enjoy retirement with my wife Kerry,” he says in an email to customers.

Team McMillan has been BMW's biggest dealership for two years in a row and is heading toward a third, Mr McMillan says. BMW is also the country's leading luxury car brand, a statement from BMW NZ managing director Nina Englert says.

In 2012, Mr McMillan became the country’s first exclusive Rolls-Royce dealer and in recent years has focused his efforts on that marque.

He says he is confident Team McMillan's success will continue under the leadership of managing director Ian Gibson, his management team and the staff.

February, Giltrap Group sold its Auckland Toyota dealerships to Rick Armstrong.
