
The project was the idea of two music lovers who wanted to install pianos around the downtown area for people to gather around, play and sing this summer.

Outdoor pianos have been a big hit in Iowa City, New York and Mason City, where one was damaged by vandals over the weekend.

The pianos will be donated, bolted down and covered at night and during rain storms. Nearby business owners have agreed to baby-sit the pianos during the pilot program.

"It adds to the street life. So wherever there is a piano, someone plays it. It will be open to the public, people will gather. And as we've seen in other cities it's an attractive thing to have near a business," said Larry James, of City Sounds, a public piano project.

The City Council voted Monday to go ahead with the project. If it works, there could be dozens of pianos in high-traffic pedestrian spots  around Des Moines in the years to come.

Meanwhile, the council also voted to clear up sign clutter in Des Moines. The decision will reduce the number of billboards and outlaw tall pole signs.

Signs erected in the future will have to be short or monument-sized, like those that are up in suburbs. The City Council also wants to restrict or  ban fast-changing video and pictures in smaller electronic signs across the city, but that is facing opposition from small-business owners.

The Council also approved Des Moines' first official "quiet street." It's SW 14th from Gray's Lake to Blank Park Zoo. The $150,000 change will include efforts to calm traffic and make the street more pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly.
