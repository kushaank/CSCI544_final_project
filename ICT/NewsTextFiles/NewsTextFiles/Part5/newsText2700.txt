The shocking incident took place at Bank of India's Tilak Road branch when complainant Gurunath Mallinath Munadi (18years,) who works in R A Mulani and Company, went to the branch to deposit cash of Rs3.12 lakh.

While waiting in the queue for depositing money at the bank, a man struck up a conversation with him. "He was standing right behind me in the queue and asked me about my job. When I gave him the details, he said that he knew my boss and asked me for his phone number. He later pretended to call him and hung up. He told me his name as Raju and that he lives on third floor of the building opposite to the bank. He told me to deliver a cheque to his wife and get cash which I was supposed to deposit in my employer's account," said Gurunath.
