
WOOLWORTHS’ acquisition of Australian clothing retailer David Jones is the biggest offshore acquisition by a South African retailer ever. It is also one of the neatest deals I’ve seen done by a South African company. It is sailing through regulatory hurdles.

The R23.3bn all-cash offer to the shareholders of David Jones is larger than Walmart’s R16.5bn purchase of a controlling stake in Massmart. It will push Woolworths up the ranks of large JSE companies and leave it with a market cap of roughly R70bn, making it South Africa’s second-largest retailer behind Shoprite.

The David Jones board is backing the deal and the share prices of both groups have appreciated since the announcement — an unusual vote of confidence.

With politicians in a state about megadeals in Europe such as US-based Pfizer’s bid for the UK’s AstraZeneca, and General Electric’s bid for France’s Alstom, investment bankers are more sensitive than ever about what obstacles politicians may throw in the way of successfully concluding a deal.

But Woolworths is navigating those risks with aplomb, having a far easier time of it than Walmart had when buying Massmart in 2010, a deal that faced spirited opposition from certain South African cabinet ministers.

In a shareholder announcement on Friday, Woolworths took pains to point to the positive effect the deal will have on South Africa and the region, with sourcing in the region leading to increased exports. The head office of the global group will remain in Cape Town.

Woolworths does not need any formal permission from local regulators, apart from the important permission of the Reserve Bank to externalise the cash to be used in the transaction. That was granted last week.

The Australian authorities have a tighter noose on foreign acquisitions of their companies, something our politicians would no doubt like. Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board must make recommendations on any deal worth more than R2.4bn and the Treasury must approve it. David Jones got that nod earlier this month. So far, then, the regulatory needs are all falling rapidly into place.

Woolworths will put R10bn of cash in the purchase from its own resources and debt, with the balance raised through equity and offshore debt. The funders — Citibank, JP Morgan and Standard Bank — are going to lend another R10bn to the transaction, which will be repaid through a share issue once the deal is done.

Another R4bn of debt will be raised in Australia. It is likely that a significant chunk of equity will be raised from foreign investors, so the deal is only being part-funded by South African capital — I would guess about half. Woolworths has no doubt already hedged out the foreign exchange rate risk.

The deal prices David Jones at a price:earnings ratio of about 21 (a 25% premium to what it was before the deal) against Woolworths’ 19, which reflects a reasonable balance of value.

If Woolworths can spark some growth at David Jones the deal will be neutral from an earnings-per-share point of view. Woolworths intends, of course, to kick David Jones’s growth up far more than that: the retailer has seen flat sales growth for the past four years.

Woolworths reckons it can improve operations by introducing its customer loyalty card insights, increased private label sales and small-format stores.

"All told, Woolworths see synergies of R1.4bn within five years. That will help fill the hole being made by the fees it is paying for the transaction, which will add up to R360m.
