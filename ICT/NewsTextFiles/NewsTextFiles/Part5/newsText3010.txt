
A 28-year-old man is fighting for his life and remains in critical condition after being shot on St-Hubert St. near Mont-Royal Ave. last night.

Montreal police spokesperson Daniel Lacoursière said residents heard gunshots around 7:50 pm.

They were able to see a man from their window sitting in his car covered in blood.

Officers arrived on the scene shortly after and found the man in his car.

Lacoursière said the victim was shot at least once in the upper body.

"This incident may be related to a [drug dealing] affair, and we're going to follow the health condition of the man in the next [few] hours," he said.

Lacoursière added there have been no arrests made. Police are currently canvassing the area looking for clues.
