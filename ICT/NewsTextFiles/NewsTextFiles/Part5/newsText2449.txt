BEIJING, China -- Bahamaren has assisted, coordinated, and participated in a number of tourism events throughout the year to promote the Bahamas as a premier travel destination.  The CEO of Bahamaren Latrae Rahming joined Bahamian students at the University of International Business and Economics in show chasing what the Bahamas has to offer to China from tourism, food, music, and culture. Bahamaren provided both financial and material support along with the Embassy of the Bahamas in Beijing.

The company understands the importance of these events as they create a chance to meet important prospects and customers face-to-face, gain their insight, and learn their impressions in a way that electronic communication does not allow.  Bahamaren recognized if it’s going to make the Bahamas a premier travel destination they have to ensure to increase awareness about the Bahamas in China.   During the event students were able to get a taste of what the Bahamas has to offer from sampling the Bahamian made macaroni to the famous Bahamian dish Chicken Souse.  They were also able to drink the Bahamas Sky Juice, which was considered their favorite along with the Bahamian dish macaroni.

These trade shows offer an invaluable opportunity to network with potential supply chain entities as well as other businesses within the tourism industry. Over time, networking within the tourism industry has opened new opportunities the company.  By displaying Bahamian products and brand in trade shows, we create an awareness about them as well as generate interest among customers.
