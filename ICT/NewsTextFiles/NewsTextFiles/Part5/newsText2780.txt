
Chipotle is requesting that all non-law enforcement customers refrain from bringing guns into their stores amid pressure from a mothers’ group calling for complete ban on guns in stores.

Chipotle says it typically defers to local laws on the issue because it doesn’t think it’s fair for employees to ask customers not to bring guns into stores. But backlash following a gun rally at a Dallas Chipotle this weekend led the chain to take action.

Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, a Michael Bloomberg-backed gun control group, began circulating a petition calling for the company to prohibit guns in its stores on Monday following a gun rally at a Dallas Chipotle this weekend. According to a press release , the petition received over 10,000 signatures.

The group, which has launched similar petitions against Starbucks , Jack in the Box, and Facebook, applauded the company’s swift response. “Chipotle’s statement that firearms are not welcome in their restaurants is bold and meaningful – it shows that you can support the Second Amendment while also taking reasonable measures to ensure that Americans are safe and secure in the places we take our children,” said founder of Moms Demand Action Shannon Watts.
