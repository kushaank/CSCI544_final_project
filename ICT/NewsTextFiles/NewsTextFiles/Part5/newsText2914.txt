
Congress has ordered the FAA to come up with regulations to govern how UAVs will be safely incorporated into the airspace.

But his most recent business has him flying head-on into federal controversy.

Using custom-built drones, the recent Virginia Tech graduate began operating an aerial photography company for local organizations last year. Since then, he’s helped film mansions in Florida, snowboarders in Colorado and promotional videos for cloud-computing company Rackspace, where he works his day job as a product developer.

But the FAA says all commercial use of unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, requires its specific approval. It’s a nod the administration has only bestowed on one operation, and that was for a series of flights above the Arctic — not Blacksburg.

The small helicopters were called remote-controlled toys when Lytle, 25, first began flying them when he was 11 years old.

But now that they’re more advanced and cheaper ($479 on Amazon.com ), they’re called drones and said to be the foundation of a multibillion-dollar industry. Everything from crop dusting to feature film photography, supporters say, could be made easier with UAVs.

Drones have been used for these kinds of applications aboveboard outside the United States, like filming the Olympics in Sochi, Russia, this year. But they remain highly regulated domestically.

Congress has ordered the FAA to come up with regulations to govern how UAVs will be safely incorporated into the airspace so they’re not falling out of the sky or getting sucked into jetliners’ engines.

To help with the effort, the FAA named six certified research and test site operators across the country, including Virginia Tech.

The administration is drafting that proposal now and expects to release it by November, possibly sooner. From there, it could take years to become finalized law, according to FAA spokesman Les Dorr.

In the meantime, battle lines are being drawn between the FAA, which is struggling to regulate the emerging technology in the absence of these rules, and a community of thousands of technology enthusiasts who want to explore the full potential of drones.

Pilots across the country are growing impatient and defying the FAA’s ban. As recently as last month, a drone was openly used to take aerial photos of the train derailment in Lynchburg — arguably a commercial use of the technology.

Dorr said UAV regulations are a priority for the administration, but this kind of thing just takes time.

Dorr added that even without finalized UAV rules, the FAA has the authority to ban unauthorized commercial use of the drones — a response Lytle disagrees with, but expected.

Both sides of the debate seem to understand how things work when the FAA does clamp down.

First, the FAA hears about someone who is making money off flying UAVs, from media sources. The FAA begins with a warning letter and eventually sends a cease and desist, which it has done 12 times across the country.

What happens next: usually nothing.

Dorr said the FAA has the power to impose fines, but it has done so just two times. Both of those cases were for “careless and reckless operation of an aircraft,” not commercial use.

One of those fines, $10,000 against Raphael Pirker, was set aside in March when a federal administrative judge ruled the FAA’s drone rules are just guidelines and aren’t legally enforceable. Pirker was filming with a drone for the University of Virginia Medical Center.

However, Dorr is unaware of a case in which the FAA has pursued penalties against a drone pilot for commercial use.

With the sporadic enforcement and the Pirker case, Lytle said pilots like himself have begun to grow bolder with drone use. With at least one court decision on their side, Lytle isn’t afraid to let people know about his business.

He said he never got into drone photography with the intention of making money, but rather because he loves flying. He routinely waives his fee to fly for student groups and nonprofits, once even flying at a child’s birthday party.

Even after being told the risks associated with publicizing his business, Lytle said he understands where the government has drawn the line, and he’s not afraid to wander close to it.

“It wasn’t illegal. There were no laws,” Lytle said of his flights. “It was potentially costly, financially costly. The FAA can fine you.

Lytle said he has flown about 30 flight assignments with AirHokie.

Since the FAA hasn’t introduced its regulations, Lytle has built his own sort of code that governs his flights and talks first about safety when anyone expresses interest in learning to fly UAVs.

He never flies over people or in places where he can’t control his surroundings. He always runs through a preflight checklist before takeoff and routinely monitors his equipment.

Lytle said he has purchased accidental and liability insurance for AirHokie, so he’s covered for up to $10 million.
