
More ag organizations are voicing opposition to the USDA’s proposal to relax restrictions on imports of animal products from Brazil.

The National Farmers Union (NFU), along with the United States Cattlemen's Association (USCA), sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack requesting he withdraw the proposal. Recent revelations about the state of livestock health and food safety standards in Brazil raise additional concerns about loosening restrictions on imports.

Brazil has a history of foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks among livestock, but recently bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), another contagious animal disease, was confirmed in Mato Grosso, a state in the region of Brazil from which USDA proposes to allow imports of animal products.

When BSE was first identified in the U.S. in December 2003, 65 of U.S. trading partners eventually imposed partial or full bans on U.S. beef.

The letter states that the health and integrity of animal agriculture is extraordinarily important to rural America and to the U.S. economy as a whole and that proper scrutiny must be given to the events in Brazil.

USDA recently released correspondence with Brazilian food safety regulators about the country’s meat inspection system. USDA conducted an audit in early 2013, which found concerns about Brazil’s ability to evaluate food safety procedures.

Brazilian regulators have begun to consider changes in standards and enforcement but have not fully implemented these measures.
