
Roby Schapira of Wells Fargo Bank said the bank has ambitious new small-business lending goals.

Wells Fargo Bank was the top Small Business Administration lender in New Mexico and the U.S. in 2013, and in the next five years, the bank wants to increase both figures by a lot.

Wells has a new five-year lending goal to provide $100 billion in new small business loans by 2018, the company said.

Exactly how much that will mean to New Mexico, where Wells made 36 SBA loans totaling $17 million in 2013, isnâ€™t clear because the company has no state-by-state goals. Over the past three years, Wells has made $46.8 billion in new small business loans nationally.

â€œThere are no statewide goals, itâ€™s based on lendable customers,â€� said Roby Schapira , Southwest Small Business & Wells Fargo at Work segment leader.

The bank has 94 locations in 51 communities throughout New Mexico, and it has small business lenders in each location, Schapira said.

To help launch the lending campaign, Wells is running a contest where small businesses can submit a 600-word essay or a 2.5-minute video responding to questions about their business. Twenty-five finalists will each receive $1,000 grants for their businesses. Five grand prize winners will receive $25,000 grants along with mentors and advice tailored to their business.

The contest runs through June 30. For more information, visit Wells fargoworks.com.
