
Disney Cruise Line has announced that they will be offering a pair of 10 night cruises to Hawaii in 2015.  Both of these cruises to the 50th state will be on the Disney Wonder.

Disney has only offered 2 sailings in their 15 year history to Hawaii, both were in 2012 and also on the Disney Wonder.

The first of these two new sailings will leave Vancouver, B.C. on September 7, 2015 and stop in the ports of Hilo, Nawiliwili, Kahului, and end in Honolulu.  The second sailing will leave Honolulu on September 17, 2015 and stop in the same ports of call as the ship sails back to Vancouver, B.C.

Cabins on these two new Hawaiian sailings can begin being reserved on Wednesday, May 21, 2014. Fares start at $1,650 per person for an inside stateroom, based on double occupancy.

The Disney Wonder was the 2nd cruise ship built by Disney Cruise Line and was completed in 1999.  The 83,000 gross ton ship can accommodate up to 2,700 passengers in 875 staterooms.
