
John Banks' appearance in the High Court was delayed after the protester threw manure across his suit.

A protester threw mud across the former ACT leader as he headed into court.

Banks was standing trial over allegations he knowingly filed a false electoral return.

John Banks appears in the dock at Auckland High Court in a fresh suit after earlier being hit by manure.

Auckland police have arrested a man who yesterday threw a bucket of what appeared to be manure over ACT leader John Banks.

A spokeswoman confirmed the 78-year-old, who confronted the politician outside the Auckland High Court, had been charged with common assault and would appear in Auckland District Court this afternoon.

It is understood the alleged offender is Castislav "Sam" Bracanov.

It is unknown exactly what the substance was that covered Banks' suit but he was allowed a couple of hours to go and change before his trial started yesterday.

Banks is on trial on charges of "transmitting a return of electoral expenses knowing that it is false in a material particular".

The charge relates to three entries in the electoral returns for Banks' failed 2010 Auckland mayoral campaign that were recorded as anonymous.

The Crown says Banks knew two donations of $25,000 were from the internet mogul and one of $15,000 was from SkyCity.
