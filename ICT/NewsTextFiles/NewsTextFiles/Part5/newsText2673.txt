
In  an emailed response this morning to PNC News, Officer Balajadia said  the investigation of the incident is being  conducted by both the FBI  and GPD's Criminal Investigations Division. And because the package is  the subject of an on going investigation he could not provide details  about it or say what was found in it.

20 to 30 families were  temporarily evacuated from their homes across  from the park following a  911 call made about 7:30pm Saturday. GHS/OCD  Spokeswoman Alyssa Benito  confirmed that the caller threatened to set  off 3 bombs unless  Ricky  McIntosh is released from prison.  McIntosh  is one of the  acquitted  Bank of Guam robbery suspects who is  being  held on an unrelated  robbery charge now.

GPD, FBI, a Navy EOD team and Guam Homeland  Security all responded to  the Saturday incident.

The All Clear was not sounded until 3am  Sunday.

Officer Balajadia also said the Saturday incident was not related to the Friday incident. The Ambyth building in Harmon was  evacuated late Friday afternoon while authorities investigated what was  said to be a "suspicious package".

However   Officer Balajadia says  the package turned out to contain items that a   former employee had  returned to the company. Balajadia said because  the  employee did not  want to see his former Supervisor, he left the   package at the front door  and left.

"Ambyth employees took precautions and contacted the police", said Officer Balajadia.
