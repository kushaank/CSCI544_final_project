Besides serving on company boards, I’m also the author of several books, including How to Create the Next Facebook: Seeing Your Startup Through, from Idea to IPO and The Complete M&A Handbook .  As for my background, I have launched various startups.  One was WebIPO, which was a place where investors got research as well as access to deals for the dot-com boom. From there, I started Hypermart.net, which was sold to InfoSpace in 1999.

Some of the greatest entrepreneurs have been war veterans. Just look at Fred Smith, who created FedEx FedEx (FDX). He served in the US Marine Corps from 1966 to 1969 (he flew on over 200 combat missions in Vietnam and received the Silver Star, Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts). In fact, Smith thought his experience with logistics was critical for his entrepreneurial success.

So with many veterans now looking for opportunities, why not explore a startup? Well, according to Craig Hanson, who is a venture partner at Next World Capital , he is making this a priority. To this end, he has setup VetCap , which was launched last week.

VetCap plans to rollout workshops across the US, which will include many top venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. At the inaugural event in San Francisco, for example, some of the attendees were Katherine Webster, Executive Director and Founder of VetsinTech; David Mayhew, Chief Risk Officer of GE Ventures; and Kevin Laws, COO/Angel Investor Investor of AngelList.

While the event was focused on the tech market, this will not necessarily be the case for others. “The topic will change based on the area,” said Craig.

In fact, VetCap is kind of like the concept of open-source software! That is, the platform is easy to setup and customize in any city.
