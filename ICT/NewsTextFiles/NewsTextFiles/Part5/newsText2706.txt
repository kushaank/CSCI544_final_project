A Sugar Land woman is recovering after she was attacked Friday afternoon while returning home from the bank.

Police say the 43-year-old was returning home at about 2pm to the 2700 block of Grants Lake Boulevard when she stopped near her mailbox. They say she saw two men parked nearby in a blue Honda Accord. According to investigators, the passenger exited that vehicle, forced the woman to the ground and stole her van.

"It's scary," neighbor Kazi Ali said. "Now it looks like they're coming out and getting into the nice neighborhoods."

The victim is the owner of what her family says is a convenience store in Houston. Police believe she was followed home from the bank.

Still, that's caused neighbors to wonder and to question their own security.

"We've never seen anything like that. It's kinda weird that that's happened," neighbor Laura Romano said.

The victim describes the passenger as a man in his 20s, clean shaven, wearing a dark gray hoodie and dark sweat pants. She said the driver of the getaway vehicle wore a hoodie.

Her van was found abandoned later in that day in the 14000 block of Irene Street in Houston.

A large amount of cash that had been inside the van was gone.
