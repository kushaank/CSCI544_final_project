
KUALA LUMPUR — Shares in Malaysia Airlines (MAS) logged a second day of sharp declines to hit a record low on Monday, after the airline posted big quarterly losses due to the disappearance of flight MH370 and the Prime Minister reportedly not ruling out bankruptcy as an option for the carrier.

The slide could add urgency to talk that the loss-making airline might need a financial rescue from state investor Khazanah Nasional, which owns 69 per cent of the company.

Bankruptcy might be one of several options for the airline to restructure after years in the red, the Wall Street Journal reported Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak as saying.

“We have to look at it from all angles, bearing in mind that MAS is a government-linked company,” Mr Najib was quoted as saying by the newspaper in a report on Friday.

An official at the Prime Minister’s office said the comment was from an interview that took place in April, ahead of the airline’s quarterly results.

Shares in MAS tumbled 18 per cent to a record low of 15.5 sen at the close, the biggest retreat since the Asian financial crisis, adding to a drop of 9.5 per cent on Friday. The airline’s shares have dropped 60 per cent over the past year.

“What the PM said was a big trigger — those are strong words and might have catalysed some investors,” said an analyst from a local bank, who declined to be identified.

The airline and its key stakeholders are in talks with banks for a strategic overhaul that could include the partial sale of its engineering unit and an upgrade of its ageing fleet, sources have told Reuters.

The airline said last week the disappearance of flight MH370 has put additional stress on the company’s operations, forcing it to re-examine more urgently its business plan after reporting the biggest quarterly loss since 2011.

Its first-quarter net loss expanded by nearly two-thirds to RM443.4 million (S$172 million) from RM278.8 million a year earlier.
