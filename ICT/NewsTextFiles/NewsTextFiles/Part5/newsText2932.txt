
TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) â€” Five Michigan lawmakers are sponsoring measures designed to pressure Canada not to let a power company bury radioactive waste less than a mile from Lake Huron.

State Sen. Phil Pavlov of St. Clair Township says the package will be introduced Tuesday. It asks U.S. officials to seek intervention from the International Joint Commission, which advises both nations on issues affecting the Great Lakes and other shared waterways.

Another measure asks the Great Lakes Commission to get involved. The commission represents the states and Canadian provinces within the Great Lakes watershed.

Ontario Power Generation wants to store low-level nuclear waste in rock chamber deep underground. The company says it would be safe, but opponents fear radioactivity could eventually reach Lake Huron.

A Canadian government panel has announced plans for more hearings.
