
This morning we were all up early and ready to head to the Actun Tunichil Muknal (Cave of the Crystal Sepulchre), also known locally as “Xibalba” or ATM, is a cave in Belize, near San Ignacio, Cayo District, notable as a Maya archaeological site that includes skeletons, ceramics, and stoneware. There are several areas of skeletal remains in the main chamber. The best-known is "The Crystal Maiden", the skeleton of a teenage girl (actually a boy) possibly a sacrifice victim, whose bones have been calcified to a sparkling, crystallized appearance.

The ceramics at the site are significant partly because they are marked with "kill holes", which indicates they were used for ceremonial purposes. Many of the Mayan artifacts and remains are completely calcified to the cave.

. The ride was without LA boys (aka David) 'amazingly intriguing' jokes. They passed the time what can I say.

The caving experience was actually a complete first for me and in summary 'it was so bad it was good but it was bad and yet so good!' OMG I have been spending too much time with the Americans! In summary trying to squeeze my big arse and wide shoulders through dark was truly a scary adrenaline rush to start with and there were several what the hell am I doing moments.. But it was truly worth it! My mother would have fainted knowing what her daughter was getting up to. Even i thought the charm of trekking through jungle in wet socks and shoes made me wonder when my madness would end!

On the way back it started to rain. You would thinker were in a van no probs.. Oh no.. The van had leaks in the ceiling causing muddy  wet rain to pour onto the passengers. We still laughed.

Anyway I best get back to my cocktails, annoying Dave and finding out what tomorrow's camping trip to Tikal involves.

I have to say Mauro, J and Sarah are definitely missed. Belize is fun but it is nowhere as amazing as Patagonia!
