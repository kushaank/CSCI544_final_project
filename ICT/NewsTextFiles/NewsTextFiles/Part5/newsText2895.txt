
Police arrested two Bulgarians suspected of installing a copying gadget in an automatic teller machine (ATM) inside a mall in Mexico, Pampanga before the weekend,  a police official said.

Police regional spokesman Supt. Nelson Aganon said Mladenov Emil Stoyanov and Kanev Lyuven Georgiev, who loitering near the Banco de Oro ATM  at the SM City, were seized when a bank client reported that the ATM had two pin pads with card skimmer.

“Initial investigation showed the two men were involved in installation of copying gadget in the ATM,” Aganon said.

Police seized from the two men three port cables that matched the ATM Card Skimmer, a small flat screw driver, a laptop with software that decodes accounts. Charges have been filed against them at the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor.

Aganon said the suspects were detained at the Mexico Police Station while police were waiting for a commitment order from the court.

“Our police there have been coordinating with the Bureau of Immigration for verification of the suspects’ status as they may be involved in an international syndicate engaged in ATM card fraud,” Aganon said.
