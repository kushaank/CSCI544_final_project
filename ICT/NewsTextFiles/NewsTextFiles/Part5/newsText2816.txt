
Greg Fitchitt, vice president of development for Howard Hughes Corp., is working on deals for the company's Downtown Columbia project. Fitchitt is in Las Vegas for the International Council of Shopping Centers convention.

Howard Hughes Corp. is in discussions with two anchor tenants for the companyâ€™s Downtown Columbia development, and leases could be signed by yearâ€™s end.

Those leases â€” one for a corporate headquarters and the other for a possible medical office complex â€” would be key to developing the huge retail portion of the Downtown Columbia project that may include a new Howard County Library System branch, a concert hall, a hotel conference center and a swimming center.

Greg Fitchitt , Howard Hughes' vice president of development, described the company's plans at the International Council of Shopping Centers convention in Las Vegas. Fritchitt is here to help pitch Howard Hughes' Summerlin project in Las Vegas, which is about 60 percent leased and under construction. He's also promoting the soon-to-open Riverwalk in New Orleans.

The Downtown Columbia plans are aren't quite as advanced as those projects. Howard Hughes is focused on signing tenants for the corporate headquarters and medical offices planned for Columbia.

"It's deal-driven," Fritchitt said. â€œWeâ€™re working on both [deals], but if one of them decides their board wants to move on this now,â€� construction for one or both of the developments could get underway by next year.

Fitchitt said the company is looking for commitments of at least 150,000 square feet, but the company is entitled to build as much as 2 million square feet of office and 2,300 residential units.

Howard Hughes also is close to resolving a dispute with Howard County Executive Ken Ulman over the future of the Merriweather Post Pavilion, Fitchitt said. Ulman had proposed a new requirement on Howard Hughes Corp.â€™s master plan for Downtown Columbia that would require the company to hand over control of the concert venue earlier than planned.
