
A new retailer has been added to the lineup at Newport on the Levee .

Kelleyâ€™s Kloset is now open in the main Gallery Building at the mixed-use center in Northern Kentucky.

The store will feature womenâ€™s clothing and accessories at a discounted price, including tops and shirts, dresses, jewelry, handbags and scarves.

The addition of Kelleyâ€™s Kloset comes on the heels of an announcement that one of the Leveeâ€™s restaurants, Naked Tchopstix, closed its doors last week. A spokeswoman said there isnâ€™t a new tenant signed on for that space at this time.
