
With this month's news of a breakthrough in synthetic biology – extending the genetic code – we repeat a special edition of Science Weekly from July 2013, our report from the sixth international meeting on the subject at Imperial College London. Alok Jha met leading researchers to discuss the extraordinary promise and potential problems of this new field of biology.

The conference hosted a diverse range of scientists, academics and artists. Alok interviewed designer Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg about collaborating with bio-engineers and scientists in imagining future applications and consequences of this emerging technology; Dr Tom Ellis of Imperial College London and Dr Leslie Mitchell of Johns Hopkins University about their work creating a synthetic yeast; Prof Farren Issacs from Yale University about new tools he is designing for biomedical research; and biological conservationist and consultant Kent Redford on using synthetic biology to preserve the world's biodiversity.
