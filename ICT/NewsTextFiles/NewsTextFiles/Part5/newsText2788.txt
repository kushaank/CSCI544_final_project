
Court agrees with credit and collection industry associations’ argument and decides that debt buyers in small-claims cases are not required to strictly adhere to rules of evidence.

In July 2013, the ACA International Board of Directors approved initiatives to protect the long term viability of the credit and collection industry. These efforts are funded by a three-year Industry Advancement Fund assessment.

ACA International joined the National Association of Retail Collection Attorneys and DBA International and filed a joint amicus brief with the Court of Appeals of Maryland in support of the debt buyer’s position and the industry. ACA is encouraged this important decision will positively impact its members’ ability to litigate collection cases on a level playing  field and clarify a uniform process for handling small-claim collection cases.
