
A Liberal government would make Ontario Place a condo-free zone, says Liberal Leader Kathleen Wynne.

She vowed Monday to support a “music destination” venue and another major cultural attraction at the waterfront park rather than sell land to private residential developers.

The Liberal plan for Ontario Place would include a 7.5-acre urban park, a new waterfront trail, a canal lined with stores and the protection of the waterfront attraction’s iconic Cinesphere and pods.

“I would contrast this with Tim Hudak’s and Andrea Horwath’s vision but, quite frankly, I’m not sure that they have a vision for Ontario Place. So this is the one that we’re bringing forward,” Wynne said.

An Advisory Panel on Ontario Place Revitalization — led by current mayoral candidate John Tory — recommended against placing a casino on the site but did suggest setting aside 10%-15% of the land for residential development to help fund park improvements.

Local NDP candidate Rosario Marchese accused the Liberals at that time of condoning the privatization of a public park by including condos and hotels in the plan.

Marchese said Monday he’s pleased that Wynne has listened to the message of Torontonians who want Ontario Place preserved as a public space.

Wynne said she would not enter into the municipality’s debate on whether jets should be allowed to fly in and out of the island airport.

Will Stewart, a spokesperson for the Progressive Conservative campaign, said the government has been sitting on Tory’s report for more than a year.

The PCs did not provide a position on Ontario Place’s future.
