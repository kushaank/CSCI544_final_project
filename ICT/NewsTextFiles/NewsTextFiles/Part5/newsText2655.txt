
SAVANNAH, Ga., May 19, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. today announced the new G650ER, an ultra-long-range aircraft that can travel 7,500 nautical miles/13,890 kilometers at Mach 0.85 and 6,400 nm/11,853 km at Mach 0.90. This represents an increase of up to 500 nm/926 km over the range of the G650, which entered service in 2012.

"The G650ER provides our customers with greater mission flexibility and the longest range of any business jet," said Scott Neal, senior vice president, Worldwide Sales and Marketing, Gulfstream. "It's the only business aircraft in the world capable of traveling 7,500 nm. This opens up significant nonstop city pairs, including New York to Hong Kong, Dallas to Dubai and San Francisco to Delhi. G650ER owners in Dubai will be able to reach most of the contiguous United States. From Hong Kong, operators can connect with the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. Thanks to the G650ER, the world just got a little smaller."

A Gulfstream G650ER set two speed records during flight testing earlier this year. The aircraft flew 6,947 nm/12,866 km from Los Angeles International Airport to Tullamarine Airport in Melbourne, Australia, at an average speed of Mach 0.86. It landed with fuel well in excess of the National Business Aviation Association's (NBAA) instrument flight rules (IFR) reserves. The flight, into head winds as high as 13 knots, took 14 hours and 58 minutes.

After positioning to Hong Kong, the G650ER flew 7,494 nm/13,879 km to Teterboro, N.J., accomplishing the 14-hour and 7-minute journey at an average speed of Mach 0.865 and again landing with fuel in excess of NBAA IFR reserves. The two records are pending approval by the National Aeronautic Association and, once approved, will be forwarded to the Federation Aeronautique International for confirmation as world records.

"The capabilities of the G650ER are due in part to its twin Rolls-Royce BR725 engines, the latest and most advanced member of the BR700 engine series," said Russell Buxton, president, Civil Small and Medium Engines, Rolls-Royce. "The BR725 incorporates technology from the market-leading Trent widebody engine family and was designed with excellent fuel efficiency and ample thrust margins that support the G650ER's enhanced performance."

The G650ER will share the same cabin, avionics and systems as the G650 and is undergoing Federal Aviation Administration certification. Current G650 owners and order-holders will be able to upgrade their original G650 to a G650ER beginning in the first quarter of 2015.
