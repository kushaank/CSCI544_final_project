
Tania Dickie has been appointed chief executive of     Dunedin-based Credit Union South, the first woman to achieve     the role.

Ms Dickie (47) joined the credit union in 2012 as chief       operating officer, responsible for the day-to-day operations       of the business.

She has been acting chief executive for six months.

''I look forward to stepping up permanently to the role of       chief executive and building on the credit union's       achievements in recent years,'' she said yesterday.

''My first task, in conjunction with the board, will be to       assess the market opportunities for Credit Union South and       develop and deliver on a strategy and plan to achieve this.''

As the third-largest credit union in New Zealand, and the       largest in South Island, Credit Union South must continue to       grow and develop all aspects of its services, products, how       it delivered then and the technology choices for customers       and members, she said.

The credit union was committed to improving the financial       literacy of South Islanders and being part of the       communities.

Credit Union South chairman Bevan Killick said several       international candidates from top banking, credit union and       various business backgrounds were evaluated for the position.

However, Ms Dickie emerged ''head and shoulders'' above the       group of candidates.
