
Yakult U.S.A. Inc. has begun production of its probiotic drink at its new Fountain Valley manufacturing plant.

Yakult U.S.A. is part of Tokyo, Japan-based Yakult Honsha Co., which operates food-and-beverage and pharmaceuticals units.

The parent company reported consolidated sales of $3.5 billion for its fiscal year ended March 31, up about 10% year-over-year. It had about $223 million in profit during the period, up nearly 38%.

The Fountain Valley facility, which was announced in June 2012, includes about 76,800 square feet on nearly 9 acres.

The company said it expects to make about 400,000 bottles of Yakult a day here.

Yakult drinks are sold in more than 30 countries, with global consumption of about 30 million bottles a day, according to the company.
