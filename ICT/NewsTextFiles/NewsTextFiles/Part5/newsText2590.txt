Karen Gunn, SLCC associate provost for the Division of Economic Development and Business Partnerships, will receive the award Friday during the Hispanic Chamber’s state convention.

The award recognizes “women who provide invaluable leadership, demonstrate excellence in business, community involvement and inspire others to reach their professional potential for the purpose of invigorating and enhancing the local quality of life,” according to the Hispanic Chamber.

“I am deeply humbled by this recognition and would like to share the honor and my appreciation with the college for its support,” Gunn said.

Gunn, executive director of the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses program at SLCC, will also host a panel Friday morning for women who own small businesses, focusing on successful strategies for balancing personal life with career.

Gunn oversees programs in workforce and economic development, global entrepreneurship, small-business development and women’s business development. She has also helped SLCC develop business and academic partnerships in India, China, Brazil and Ukraine.

Gunn received the 2009 Women in Business Champion Award from the U.S. Small Business Administration. In 2013, she was recognized as a Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce Champion.
