
With the Dhamra port on the east coast now in its kitty, Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone plans to raise capacity at the multi-cargo bulk handling facility, including building a container terminal there in two-three years, sources said.

On Friday, Adani Ports said it was buying out Dhamra Port in Odisha for an enterprise value of Rs 5,500 crore in an all-cash deal.

A source said the company wanted to add 12 berths at Dhamra, one of which could be a container terminal. The port has two bulk handling berths, with an installed capacity of 24 million tonnes.

“We have the required environmental approvals to add the 12 berths and so, to that extent we will be making the required investments in coming months,” Managing Director Sudipta Bhattacharya said. He, however, did not reveal the size of investment.

Buying the Odisha port was part of the company’s strategy to have a string of ports along the Indian coast and meet the target of raising capacity to 200 million tonnes by 2020, said Bhattacharya. In the year ended March, Adani Ports handled 112.75 million tonnes of cargo, including at its Australia port.

Dhamra is an attractive acquisition for Adani Group, since the all-weather port with a deep draft allows even Capesize ships, the largest cargo ships weighing between 80,000 and 175,000 deadweight tonnes, to berth and is also close to the mineral-rich region in Odisha.

Adani Ports already operates ports at Dahej, Hazira and Mundra on the west coast in Gujarat and runs a coal loading terminal in Abbot Point in Queensland, Australia. The company has started operations in Mormugao, Visakhapatnam and Kandla ports.

Dhamra Port was an equal joint venture between L&T Infrastructure Development Projects Ltd (IDPL), a subsidiary of L&T, and Tata Steel.

Dhamra port has an equity capital of Rs 2,100 crore and debt of Rs 3,400 crore, including Rs 800 crore of promoter debt, giving it a Rs 5,500-crore enterprise valuation.
