
A maker of AR-15 and other rifles is shuttering a plant in St. Cloud, which employed as many as 115 people, as part of a restructuring at parent Remington Arms Co.

The St. Cloud Times reports on the departure of DPMS Panther Arms , which was announced late last week. Remington, which like DPMS is owned by Cerberus Capital's Freedom Group, is consolidating more manufacturing in Huntsville, Ala., beginning next year. A timetable for the company's departure from St. Cloud isn't known.

DPMS was founded in 1985 by Randy Luth in Becker and began as an U.S. Army contractor, making parts for M-16 rifles and other weapons.
