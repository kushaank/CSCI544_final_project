
A baby fighting for its life after a car crash in King Country wasn't being restrained at the time, police say.

The crash happened about 8.30am Monday on State Highway 4, near Kopaki, in the Waitomo district.

Four adults and another child in the vehicle were wearing seatbelts when it crossed the centre line and crashed into a bank on the other side of the road.

The baby is believed to have been sitting in the mother's lap when the crash happened and was thrown into the rear interior.

The baby has been flown to Starship Hospital in Auckland with critical injuries.

The mother and a three-year-old suffered minor to moderate injuries, while three adults were treated at the scene.
