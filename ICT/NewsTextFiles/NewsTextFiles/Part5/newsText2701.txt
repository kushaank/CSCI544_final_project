
GENEVA--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Honda Aircraft Company announced today several achievements and        milestones in the development of the HondaJet during a press conference at the European Business Aviation Convention        and Exhibition (EBACE) in Geneva, Switzerland. The company revealed the        first production HondaJet. The aircraft is ready for ground tests and        features a new paint scheme, a deep pearl green with a gold stripe. The        company also shared its progress in preparation for HondaJet entry into        service.

The first production aircraft is in final assembly with the first set of        production GE Honda HF120 engines recently delivered to Honda Aircraft.        The engines have been installed, and Honda Aircraft will soon begin        conducting ground tests on the airplane. Its first flight is anticipated        this summer. The aircraft debuts a new exterior paint scheme in a deep        pearl green with a gold stripe. With its debut, all five exterior color        options are represented in the HondaJet fleet. The deep green finish        will be offered in addition to the vibrant silver, red, yellow and blue        exterior colors currently available to appeal to a variety of customer        preferences.

HondaJet production continues its steady pace in advance of entry into        service with nine aircraft on the final assembly line. Four aircraft        have been mated to their wings and empennages, and production is on        schedule to have 10 aircraft on the final assembly line in June. This        steady build up supports Honda Aircraft Company’s objective to have        aircraft ready for delivery immediately after type certification is        achieved next year.

Stall speed, stall characteristics and stall warning system: Tests          were conducted under various flight conditions. During testing, the          stall warning system (stick shaker attached to the yoke) and stall          protection system (stick pusher that provides automatic stall          recovery) were evaluated. Cockpit indications for airspeed, altitude          and ambient temperature were also validated.

Wheels, tires and brake control system tests: Normal anti-skid brake          control systems were evaluated in both wet and dry runway conditions.          Emergency brake system testing also demonstrated aircraft braking          capability during degraded system operations.

Flap actuation system and speed brake operation throughout the flight          envelope: Testing demonstrated aircraft flap and speed brake operation          at limit speeds and maximum load factor.

Hydraulic system control tests were conducted during normal, abnormal          and degraded operations: The hydraulic system was demonstrated at the          maximum operating altitude and after extended periods of high-altitude          cold soaking.

In-flight fire suppression system: This testing was conducted at          critical flight conditions for both speed and temperature.

FAA Full-Scale Fatigue Testing: The ground structural test program has        completed more than 2,000 cycles so far in advance of entry into        service. This is equivalent to more than five years of use for typical        business jet operators. Testing examined the airframe’s fatigue strength        under simulated in-flight operations derived from theoretical load        spectra and mission profiles. The tests evaluated the effects of        vertical and lateral maneuvers; vertical and lateral gust; landing;        taxi; Ground-Air-Ground (GAG) and fuselage pressure cycle on the        aircraft. This testing was conducted at Honda Aircraft Company’s R&D        facility in Greensboro, N.C., using a sophisticated structural test        system that can simultaneously operate 73 hydraulic actuators and cabin        pressurization in a closed loop digital control system using force,        pressure or displacement as the feedback parameters.

Honda Aircraft Company also announced at EBACE that Fokker        Aerostructures will supply the empennage structure for the HondaJet.        Fokker was selected based on its expertise in the manufacturing of tail        sections for business jets with a global supply chain network.

Headquartered in Papendrecht, the Netherlands, Fokker Technologies        operates facilities in the United States, Mexico, Canada, Romania,        Turkey, Singapore and China. The company provides a range of integrated        aerospace systems and services to top commercial and business aviation        manufacturers worldwide.

Honda Aircraft is putting significant effort and investment into pilot        and maintenance training for customers. Working with FlightSafety        International, Honda Aircraft is currently developing flight and        maintenance training curriculums with maintenance training classes        scheduled to begin later this year in Greensboro, N.C. The first flight        simulator for flight training is complete and software integration is        underway. Flight training with this simulator will include type rating        and recurrent pilot training programs for both single and multi-crew        operations. Training will be provided at Honda Aircraft Company’s world        headquarters and will start before entry into service.

Honda Aircraft marked a significant milestone earlier this year with its        1,000th team member joining the company. The company’s        growing workforce represents more than 43 countries and reflects the        aviation industry’s top talent in engineering, manufacturing, sales and        service.

The HondaJet is the world’s most advanced light business jet aircraft,        with best-in-class advantages in performance, comfort, quality and        efficiency. The HondaJet is the fastest, highest-flying, quietest, and        most fuel-efficient jet in its class. The HondaJet incorporates many        technological innovations in aviation design, including the unique        Over-The-Wing Engine Mount (OTWEM) configuration that dramatically        improves performance and fuel efficiency by reducing aerodynamic drag.        The OTWEM design also reduces cabin sound, minimizes ground-detected        noise, and allows for the roomiest cabin in its class, the largest        baggage capacity, and a fully serviceable private aft lavatory. The        HondaJet is powered by two highly fuel-efficient GE Honda HF120 turbofan        jet engines, and is equipped with the most sophisticated glass flight        deck available in any light business jet, a Honda-customized Garmin® G3000 next-generation, all-glass avionics system composed of three        14-inch landscape-format displays and dual touch-screen controllers. The        HondaJet is Honda's first commercial aircraft and lives up to the        company's reputation for superior performance, efficiency, quality and        value.
