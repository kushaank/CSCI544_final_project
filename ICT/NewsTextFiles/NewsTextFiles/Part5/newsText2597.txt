
The Great Lakes Business Leadership Network will host an event featuring Kathleen Martinez, U.S. assistant secretary of labor for disability policy, at The H Hotel on Wednesday from 7:30 to 9 a.m.

Martinez will discuss federal Section 503 hiring regulations that went into effect for all federal contractors in March. In addition to a presentation, Martinez will be answering questions from the audience. A crowd of more than 60 representatives from area businesses and agencies is expected.

The event is open to the public. The network encourages employers with federal contracts, as well as those interested in current trends in disability hiring practices, to attend. The breakfast is free to Great Lakes BLN members and $7 for non-members.
