
A Nottingham city hotel and neighbouring pub have closed with the loss of 42 jobs.

The Grade II listed Lace Market Hotel has been up for sale for the past five months as a going concern.

But administrators Smith Cooper said the level of interest for purchasing the business "was minimal".

It was part of the Finesse group, which has three other hotels in Belper, Castle Donington and Derby. These are unaffected by the closure.

Company director James Blick said: "We are devastated we have got to this position, we will be doing everything we can to help our staff find alternative work and supporting them wherever we can at this distressing time."

The hotel and nearby Cock and Hoop public house, which was part of the group, closed on Monday morning.

Smith Cooper said both properties were sold to a private investor, who intends to refurbish them.

Couples due to have weddings at the hotel are being offered the company's Cathedral Quarter Hotel in Derby as an alternative and guests booked in will be offered accommodation at other Finesse hotels.
