
We have previously commented on the stricter approach being taken to immigration and visa violations in the UAE.  Since this is a hot topic in the UAE, we are addressing it again.  Particularly to highlight that in the event of a violation it may be the General Manager or the HR Manager that will be subject to penalties, which may include imprisonment.

It is a legal requirement for an entity to be properly legally established in the UAE before it can enter into employment arrangements in the UAE.   In many cases companies will have identified the ‘perfect’ candidate prior to having completed their incorporation in the UAE.  To avoid the risk of losing the candidate, they will look to adopt ‘workarounds’ such as asking a ‘friendly’ company to employ the individual on their behalf so that the individual can obtain a visa and therefore live and work in the UAE.

Any company, therefore, not complying with the immigration and visa requirements should urgently review its position.

"Any company that is caught employing illegal workers will face a AED 50,000 fine per worker on the first offence, and a AED 100,000 fine per worker on the second offence.  And if the owner of the company is an expatriate, he will be deported and banned from entering the country for life while if the owner is a national, he will be jailed for a minimum of six months."
