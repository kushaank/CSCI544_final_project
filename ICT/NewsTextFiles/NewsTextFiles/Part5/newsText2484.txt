
(UPDATED - 7:54 p.m.) MANILA, Philippines - Alleged pork barrel scam mastermind Janet Lim-Napoles sustained another legal setback as her plea for temporary liberty was not immediately granted by the Court of Appeals (CA).

In a May 14, 2014 two-page resolution penned by Associate Justice Noel Tijam, the CA’s Special 7th Division instead ordered Makati City Regional Trial Court-Branch 150 Presiding Judge Elmo Alameda and pork scam whistle-blower Benhur Luy to submit their explanation in the petition for certiorari filed by Napoles on April 10, 2014.

“Respondents are hereby directed to file a comment to the said petition within 10 days from notice. Petitioner may file aa reply within five days from receipt of notice,” the resolution stated.

Associate justices Priscilla Baltazar-Padilla and Edwin Sorongon concurred in the resolution.

In her petition last month, Napoles asked the CA to immediately rule on her case questioning the order issued by Alameda in November last year and last February dismissing her request to post bail for her serious illegal detention case.

Napoles argued that the prosecution’s case against her was weak and thus the Makati court should grant her temporary liberty.

The siblings allegedly locked up Luy from December 2012 to March 2013 when Janet suspected him of setting up an operation similar to the one she allegedly ran in collusion with lawmakers and other government officials to pull off the P10-billion pork barrel scam.
