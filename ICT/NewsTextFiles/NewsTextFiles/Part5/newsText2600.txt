
Expansion of the congested CY Avenue and Poplar Street intersection in Casper begins Monday.

The project is expected to take a year.

WYDOT awarded Hedquist Construction the $4.5 million contract to add turn lanes on CY and Poplar and improve access to West 15th Street.

The project's scope stretches from West 14th Street to the Walgreens parking lot entrance on Poplar and West 15th streets to Westridge Lane entrance on CY Avenue.

Businesses directly affected were notified by Hedquist Construction, which will hold weekly meetings to update owners.

“The meetings are designed to let business owners know what’s going on … it gives them input and a little ownership of the project,” Goetz said.

Many owners aren’t sure yet how they will make sure to direct people to their businesses, but they hope to have a clearer idea after the first meeting.

The city will also be upgrading the water and sewer lines while the streets are under construction.

During the first phase, CY and the north leg of Poplar will be reduced to one lane in either direction.

Construction is expected to be finished by May 31, 2015.

The project has been delayed for years while WYDOT worked to buy land around the intersection to make room for the expansion.

Over a decade ago, WYDOT purchased and demolished the old site of Karen and Jim’s Restaurant. Last year, the state purchased the Shell station across the street. It will also be demolished.

Transportation Commissioner K. John Dooley, who represents Albany, Carbon and Sweetwater counties on the board, is president of Dooley Oil Inc., which owned the station.
