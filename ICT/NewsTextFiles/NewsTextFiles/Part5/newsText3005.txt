
MONTREAL â Dust devil alert!

The Laurentians just canât cut a break. First there was a ground frost warning overnight Sunday to Monday on the Victoria Day weekend when everyone traditionally puts in the summer plants.

Now, on Monday, Environment Canada has issued a âdust devilâ special conditions statement.

Meteorologist Serge Mainville describes these conical disturbances with swirling dust âlike a small, weak tornadoâ and said they are common in the spring when the air is very dry and there are unstable conditions.

âIn the past we have seen some damage to cars and buildings,â he said of the threat of dust devils for an area that encompasses St-Sauveur all the way to Maniwaki.

Conditions will not be favourable to dust devils on Tuesday in that region, but he wouldnât rule out locusts.

Just kidding.
