
WACO (May 19, 2014) Todric Deon McDonald, 27, who’s charged with capital murder in a deadly double shooting in Waco, was named in a new complaint Monday charging aggravated robbery in connection with a holdup outside a local convenience store.

The latest charge stems from an incident that happened at around 10 p.m. on May 10 at Hap’s Ice House at North 38th and Frederick Avenue.

The victim was returning to his 2001 GMC Yukon when a man in a car displayed a handgun, Waco police Sgt. W. Patrick Swanton said.

The victim ran, and told officers that as he fled he heard the man order him to “drop his stuff,” Swanton said.

The victim told officers the man chased him for a short distance and fired several shots in his direction, Swanton said.

The man hid for several minutes, and then returned to the store to discover that his Yukon had been stolen, Swanton said.

McDonald is charged with capital murder in the shooting deaths of Justin Javier Gonzalez, 24, and Ulysses Gonzalez, 30, whose bodies were found early in the morning on May 13 inside an apartment at the Pecan Tree apartments at 2600 Grim Ave.

The two men were cousins and at least one of them was the target of the deadly shooting, Waco police Sgt. W. Patrick Swanton said.

Neither of the victims lived in the apartment, but both were visiting tenants, Swanton said.

They were inside the apartment when one or more suspects entered and gunfire erupted, Swanton said.

Both men were pronounced dead at the scene.

McDonald was arrested Friday afternoon following a short chase that reached speeds of 85 miles per hour on a city street.

A female and a toddler were in the car with him, police said.

He’s has also been charged with evading arrest or detention with a motor vehicle, theft by possession, endangering a child, failure to stop and identify, unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, assault-family violence.

He remains in the McLennan County Jail.
