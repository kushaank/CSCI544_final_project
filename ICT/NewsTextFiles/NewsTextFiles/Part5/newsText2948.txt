
Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, put the death of her brother, Mark Shand, 62 , behind her today as Prince Charles and she arrived in Canada for the start of a four-day royal tour.

The adventurer and ecologist Mr Shand died from a head injury following a freak accident in a revolving door at New York's Gramercy Park Hotel.

Prince Charles and Camilla were greeted in Halifax by dignitaries and the waiting media ahead of dozens of engagements across three provinces.

The royals will attend events including one marking the 150th anniversary of the Charlottetown conference which led to the Canadian Confederation.

After stepping off the plane, the duchess was presented with flowers by Grace Elizabeth Lenihan, aged three, and her nine-year-old sister Molly Jane.

Prince Charles will meet traders at a local farmers' market in Halifax, while the duchess will witness the work of a project that helps victims of domestic violence.

The couple will visit Pictou County for an event to celebrate Celtic heritage in Nova Scotia.

They will travel to Charlottetown, Bonshaw and Cornwall in Prince Edward Island and Winnipeg in Manitoba during the tour.

It is the third time they have travelled to Canada together and is Charles's 17th official visit to the country.
