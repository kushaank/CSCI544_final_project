In life, things are not always what they seem. Keen observers know that to be especially true of financial markets.

It pays then to look under the hood every so often to remain well informed. If we were to do so now, âdivergenceâ could well be an appropriate word to describe what has transpired since early March in U.S. equity markets. That is when recent high-flying darlings such as Netflix, Tesla, and Amazon, among others, made their respective highs. Those names have since been under pressure with stock price declines of up to 25 per cent each while the S&P 500, the index most widely used to gauge the overall health of the U.S. equity market, continues to hover near record highs. Divergence occurs when the price of certain stocks moves in the opposite direction to the index.

This is a reminder that slow-and-steady often wins the race. Stock prices of established tech companies, such as Microsoft, Intel and Cisco, continue to march steadily toward new multi-year highs. Moreover, they are doing so while their valuations remain attractive, with an average forward Price-to-Earnings ratio of 13. The PE ratio is a commonly used gauge of market valuation. It is a measure of how much investors are willing to pay for a dollar of earnings. As a reference, the long-term average forward PE ratio for the S&P 500 is around 15; it currently stands at 15.3.

The irony is that todayâs old-tech companies were yesterdayâs rowdy adolescents. Intelâs share price hit an all-time high of $75.81 in August 2000, when it was trading at 110 times earnings. Two years later, it bottomed out at $12.95. It has since doubled in price, not counting dividends, but clearly remains far from its 2000 high.

Microsoft, Cisco, and other technology stalwarts share a similar story. Those and other old-tech names are trading today at what we perceive to be good values and sport quality balance sheets, healthy profitability, and are among some of the fastest dividend growers out there. Stocks with such characteristics rank well in our quantitative stock selection model and in our opinion, offer a higher probability of reliable returns for the long-term investor.

A similar story has played out in the pharmaceuticals sector between the share prices of established pharmaceuticals companies like Pfizer, Merck and Johnson & Johnson, and high-flying biotech stocks. So-called clean technology stocks have also made headlines in the manufacturing industry.

A notable high-flyer that has recently come off its highs is Tesla Motors, a luxury electric car manufacturer founded by Internet billionaire Elon Musk. Teslaâs shares, which do not pay dividends, currently trade around $190 per share, down from a peak of $265 in March.

Tesla has a market capitalization of $23 billion, while Ford Motor Co., which has a dividend yield of 3.2 per cent, weighs in at $62 billion. Tesla sold approximately 25,000 of its Model S cars in 2013, according to S&P Capital IQ, while Ford sold 6.3 million vehicles. A back of the napkin calculation suggests the market values Ford at around $9,800 per vehicle sold, while Tesla gets a staggering $920,000 per car.

While that is a somewhat tongue-in-cheek comparison, it illustrates the tremendous faith that investors have put in the continued growth of companies that are pioneering new industries, be it social media, clean technology, or biotech. So while the Internet bubble of the late 1990s might have made for a good movie, itâs probably not one worthy of a second viewing.

We cannot say whether todayâs high-growth stocks will turn out to be good or bad investments in the long term. But this level of valuation implies a high degree of confidence in continued growth. If lofty expectations are not met, these stocks could see a substantial drop in share price from which they could take years or even decades to recover.

The lesson of old-tech stocks is that valuation matters and prudence tends to pay off. Anybody who bought Intel or Microsoft in April 2000 will likely agree.

Returning to the theme of divergence, investor flight to quality names in recent weeks could be a harbinger of weakness ahead. Other divergences such as declining bond yields and weakness in small caps signal perhaps that the potential for an equity market correction is on the rise.

Corrections are an important component of healthy bull markets. If history is a guide, markets are probably overdue for a correction. If one were to develop here, it could present a good opportunity to add some quality old tech names to a well-diversified portfolio. Given increasing signs of recovery in the U.S. economy, we retain a positive view of the intermediate prospects for U.S. markets.
