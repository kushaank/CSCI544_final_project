
On Monday, the Swiss financial giant Credit Suisse became the largest bank in two decades to plead guilty in a Justice Department investigation. The bank has admitted to facilitating tax evasion and will now pay $1.8 billion in fines, including $670 million in restitution to the IRS.

Attorney General Eric Holder described the bank’s behavior and the outlines of the plea agreement in a Monday evening press conference. Credit Suisse, he said, “engaged in an extensive and wide-ranging conspiracy to help U.S. taxpayers evade taxes” through the use of offshore bank accounts.

The $1.8 billion Credit Suisse will pay to the federal government is substantially lower than the $13 billion settlement which JPMorgan Chase & Co. agreed to pay six months ago. Yet JPMorgan, which faced a Justice Department investigation over allegations of securities fraud, never admitted to criminal wrongdoing; the Justice Department reportedly considered trying to force a plea , but never did. Credit Suisse may have a smaller bill than JPMorgan, but it carries the burden of an admission of guilt.

Credit Suisse did not immediately return a request for comment.
