“Congress people propose bills all the time that they don’t ask for city support on,” Leavitt said in the meeting.

Herrera Buetler blasted back in a letter to Leavitt.

“I only introduced my bill last year after obtaining support from both the Trust and the City,” she wrote.

The city recently withdrew its support of the Congresswoman’s measure, which would have transferred the museum and surrounding 7 acres from the Park Service to the city. The city’s move means the National Park Service will likely continue to operate the Pearson Air Museum.

The Mayor responded.

In an email to the Congresswoman’s legislative director, Leavitt said since he had “important and productive” business to do, his reply would be short.

“Premature, and clearly … ill-advised,” Leavitt wrote back.

“A more evolved and reasoned perspective leads one to acknowledge that a Federal House Bill attempting to peel off a part of a National Park in Vancouver, Washington, because of a local personality and operational differences between the landlord (NPS) and Tenant (FVNRT) is, at best, nonsense,” Leavitt wrote.
