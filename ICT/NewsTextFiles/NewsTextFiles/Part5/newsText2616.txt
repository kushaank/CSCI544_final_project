
The mobile phones made in China are always featured with high-end hardware configuration. 30% of the domestic mobile phones will be equipped with 13MP in the first half of 2014 and about 50% by the end of 2014 (excluding the exported ones). Both, rear and front cameras have higher pixels. 5MP front cameras are the current mainstream, while the mobile phones with 13MP front cameras have already been launched.

In 2013, the CMOS image sensor shipment reached 3.26 billion units at an increase of 15.2%, and the market size hit approximately USD8.008 billion. The shipment is expected to rise by 16% to 3.782 billion units, and the market size will be around USD8.698 billion in 2014. Camera modules are not only applied to photography, but also motion sensing for postural control, which will propel the market.

In 2013, the CMOS camera module market size attained approximately USD13.7 billion, up 18.9% from 2012; but in 2014, it will shrink greatly, up merely 6.7% to USD14.6 billion. The market competition became fiercer in 2013, especially the price wars; therefore, almost all of CMOS camera modules saw a decline of about 2 percentage points in gross margin.

South Korea Cowell performed most outstandingly in 2013 with the annual revenue growth rate of 148%. With the main production base located in Dongguan, China, Cowell acted as Apple's core supplier in 2013. Apple supported Cowell to reduce the dependence on Sharp and LG INNOTEK. In 2013, Cowell's revenue and profit surged. However, not every Apple's supplier was lucky. Primax specializing in Apple's low-end products witnessed dropping gross margin.
