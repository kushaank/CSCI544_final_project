
Repair work continues on the Champlain Bridge over the St-Lawrence River.

The federal government owns the entirety of two major Montreal bridges and half of another through inertia and quirks of history, geography and politics. The first major federal span was the Jacques Cartier Bridge, which was built in the 1920s as a project of the federally owned Port of Montreal. The Champlain was built to pass over the federal St. Lawrence Seaway. Ottawa and the province occasionally discuss selling the bridges to Quebec. Predictably, they disagree on price tag.

In 2009, the federal bridge authority had a super beam manufactured anticipating the original prestressed concrete beams might fail. Four years later, a 2-millimetre crack appeared in one of the 53-foot concrete beams, forcing the emergency closing of a portion of the bridge and the installation of the beam at a cost of $2-million. This past weekend, a new truss was installed at a cost of $1.5-million to allow removal of the emergency beam so it can be used again later, if necessary.

Each time sections of the bridge are closed for repairs (a frequent occurrence in 2013), traffic chaos ensues in Montreal. The Champlain Bridge is among the busiest in Canada with 60 million vehicle movements each year. While 66 per cent of its users are commuters, it is also a conduit for about $20-billion in trade between Canada and the United States.
