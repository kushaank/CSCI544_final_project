
Fuddruckers on Western Boulevard closed on Mother’s Day. The corporate office of Fuddruckers had no details about the closure because, they said, the restaurant is a franchise.

Wood chairs stacked on wood tables behind the front-door’s sign dispelled the rumors: Jacksonville’s Fuddruckers is closed.

Service ceased on Mother’s Day at 9 p.m., according to the sign at the vacant restaurant — which carries a trademarked phrase, “World’s Greatest Hamburgers,” according to its website.

A spokeswoman at Luby’s Fuddruckers Restaurants LLC who did not want to be named initially sounded surprised to hear the restaurant had closed.

“Jacksonville? On Western Boulevard? My understanding is it’s still open,” she said before putting the phone on hold more than a minute. “It’s closed,” she said when she returned to the call.

Property records and articles of incorporation at N.C. Department of State did not reveal a limited liability company or corporation in Jacksonville bearing the same franchise name.

The spokeswoman in Texas also did not identify the owners.

“I can’t give out that information,” she said.

The sign recommends patrons visit the nearest Fuddruckers in Greensboro, which is about 3 hours, 15 minutes by car.

The restaurant’s demise does not reflect a trend, however, as business growth is apparent in Jacksonville.

Jacksonville-Onslow Chamber of Commerce president Laurette Leagon said many businesses are thriving locally.

For example, Margolis Men’s Store at 1140 Western Blvd. has reported a flurry of tuxedo rentals.

“Two hundred tuxes went out last week and 220 tuxes went out this week,” Leagon said.

Leagon cited only two recent business closures known to the chamber, Fuddruckers and a computer-repair business.

Friday afternoon, she had just returned from a ribbon cutting at Sweet Dimensions Bakery at 211 South Marine Blvd. The family-owned business opened about three weeks ago, she said. Sweet Dimensions Bakery’s owners are retired Marines, she added.

Chuy’s, a Tex-Mex restaurant, opened Tuesday at 1618 Western Blvd. Noodles & Company — which boasts a menu of pastas and noodles from around the world, salads and soups — opened Monday 1345 Western Blvd., according to information from the company.

The nightclub Mad Hatter opened May 5 at 3038 Richlands Highway, Leagon said.

In April, the chamber hosted a ribbon cutting for newly opened Smoothie King at 460 Western Blvd. beside Coastal Carolina Community College.

Leagon had no details but said the Taco Bell at 2055 Gum Branch Road is open, as is the new Subway at 106 Marine Blvd.

She also said some smaller businesses, including doctors’ offices, recently opened in Jacksonville.

In March and April, applicants sought Jacksonville permits for: nine residential additions, 10 residential renovations, five swimming pools, seven single-family homes, 15 commercial renovations and nine structures other than buildings.

Leagon also offered a “personal observation” about the local business climate.
