
The Disney Wonder, seen here in Honolulu Harbor in this 2012 file photo, will return to Hawaii in September 2015 for two 10-night cruises, Disney Cruise Line said Monday.

The Disney Wonder, which made its Hawaii debut in May 2012, will sail from the Canadian city of Vancouver, British Columbia, on Sept. 7, 2015, and arrive in Hawaii at Hilo before stopping at Nawiliwili, Kauai, Kahului on Maui and Honolulu. The second cruise will depart Honolulu on Sept. 17, 2015 and stop at Kahului, Hilo and Nawiliwili before heading back to Vancouver.

Talk of the Disney Wonder coming back to Hawaii started in January, and last week, the Disney Cruise Line Blog noted that certain dates in September corresponding to the cruises were booked under Disney's booking agent.

The 964-foot Disney Wonder, carries up to 2,713 passengers in 877 staterooms and has a crew of 950, was the first Disney ship to arrive in Hawaii following the opening of Aulani, a Disney Resort & Spa, which is also owned by Disney Cruise Line's parent company, The Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS).

Disney Cruise Line also said Monday that it would return to the West Coast with cruises from San Diego to Baja, Mexico, and offer seasonal cruises between Galveston, Texas, and the Bahamas, and Port Canaveral and Miami in Florida to the Bahamas and the Caribbean.
