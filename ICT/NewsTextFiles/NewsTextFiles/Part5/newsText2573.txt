
Green Mountain Powers Energy Innovation Center is filled with people attending the grand opening last year. The center will host a tech meet-up May 29.

Green Mountain Power, the Vermont Center for Emerging Technologies and Fresh Tracks Capital will co-host Tech @ Rutland Meet-Up later this month.

Organizers say the event is an opportunity for business owners and entrepreneurs seeking investors to meet and connect with resources to help rejuvenate local businesses, startups and the economy.

The informal mixer event will be held from 5 to 7 p.m. May 29 at Green Mountain Powers Energy Innovation Center at 68 Merchants Row in Rutland.

The event will not feature speeches or formal presentations, the release stated, but will provide the opportunity for entrepreneurs to trade information, ideas and make contacts with a variety of potential investors and supporters while enjoying light food and drinks.

In addition to GMP, VCET, and Fresh Tracks Capital, the event will include leaders from the Rutland Economic Development Corporation, Rutland Region Chamber of Commerce, Downtown Rutland Partnership, Rutland Redevelopment Authority, Community College of Vermont, Launch VT, North Country Angels, the Vermont Small Business Development Center, the Vermont Agency of Commerce and the Vermont Technology Council.

The event is open to the public and anyone interested is encouraged to attend.
