
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has revealed an organisation-wide information management platform, ASEAN Online , that will enable ASEAN Member States and the ASEAN Secretariat to support the internal sharing of business-critical data and information with security and mobility.

“The ASEAN Secretariat is focusing on strengthening our capabilities in information technology and management systems to provide effective support for our ASEAN Member States, in our effort to realise the ASEAN community objectives and goals,” shared Dr A.K.P. Mochtan, Deputy Secretary-General of ASEAN for Community and Corporate Affairs.

Enhancing the ASEAN Secretariat’s technology know-how is a critical priority, and so the Secretariat’s IT team is working closely with partners in tailoring the ASEAN Online portal. The portal comes with new features including access to data stored in the cloud via web browsers and mobile platforms - an important feature that will enable employees to access documents on-the-go in a secure environment, he continued.

“Another important feature that we look forward to seeing is an enhanced security system which would give us greater protection from cyberspace threats,” he noted.
