
Equity Trustees has created the role of head of cash and fixed income, following the April announcement that it had agreed to acquire 100% of ANZ Trustees for $150 million .

Lance Pupelis, who was most recently head of fixed income at ANZ Trustees and prior to that head of fixed income at Aviva Investors Australia, will take on the role.

"An internal cash and fixed income capability is needed to meet the requirements to take on the ANZ Trustees business," Equity Trustees head of private wealth services Geoffory Rimmer said.

Pupelis will be responsible for overseeing the development of an in-house capability in these categories to help ensure the smooth transition of existing investment mandates and portfolios from ANZ Trustees.

He will be based in Melbourne and will report to the chief investment officer George Boubouras.

"Lance has a long and successful track record in similar roles at ANZ Trustees, Aviva, Norwich and Portfolio Partners. He has a proven ability to build new business opportunities such as managing the ANZ Trustees fixed income fund and winning multiple third party mandates over many years at several organisations.

"He has significant asset allocation experience, including being the former chair of the Aviva Investors Australia Asset Allocation Committee and former member of the ANZ Private Bank Regional Investment Council, the peak asset allocation forum across Australia and the Pacific for the bank," Boubouras said.
