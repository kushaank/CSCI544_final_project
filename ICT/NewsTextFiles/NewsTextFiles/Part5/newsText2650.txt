Proton is always looking for challenging projects. It is a place where all artists are welcome. Quality storytelling is always a priority, but there is no specific genre that we are looking for. We like to deal with difficult issues, which help to describe the reality we live in.

We do. Through our previous works, we have made some great European partners. Also, our production services introduced us to further partners and expanded our possibilities. We are currently co-producing a documentary by Anders Ostergaard with  Magic Hour Films  (Denmark) and  Gebrueder Beetz  (Germany), and two feature films with Norway's  Paradox .

Proton inspires filmmakers to create first and second features, and helps to guide young talents. In the meantime, we are eager to experiment with new genres. Through supporting a limited number of short films, we would like to gather three or four strong artists, following the artistic leadership of Kornel Mundruczo. We also provide production services to get to experience other crews' and other nations' creativity - it's also a good source of inspiration. We would be happy to get involved in television series as well in terms of script development.
