
Mauricio "Shogun" Rua news reveals that four men with rifles victimized the former UFC light heavyweight champion in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and took his valuables including his money, car and clothes.

Manager Eduardo Alonso spoke to Brazilian website Portal do Vale Tudo about some Shogun Rua news, narrating the incident that happened during the fighter's most recent trip back to his home country.

"We were in Rio de Janeiro with Demian and we went to dinner with Mauricio at a restaurant," Alonso recounted. "At the end of the night, he left us at the hotel at Barra da Tijuca and drove back to Niteroi, where he was staying. He was driving a friend's car at Linha Vermelha and he was forced to stop by another guy with four men armed with rifles."

News on Shogun Rua has it that the former UFC 205-pound champion had to walk from Linha Vermelha to the city amidst the darkness of the night. It was also said to be one of the city's most dangerous expressways.

Alonso also expressed his disappointment towards some of their fellow countrymen, whom he said, never stopped to help Shogun Rua.

"They took everything, even his shirt," Alonso explained. "He was shoeless and shirtless. Imagine a guy at his size asking for a ride in the middle of the night."

"Nobody stopped to help him. He had to walk one mile to get to the police station. It was tense, but it's all good now," Alonso added.
