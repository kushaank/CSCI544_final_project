Oleg Cusnir, 27, was killed last week near Innisfail. The RCMP said his body was found inside a burning truck.

Oleg Cusnir, 27, was discovered inside his Ford F-350 truck near Innisfail on Thursday afternoon, RCMP said. The death is being treated as a homicide.

Cusnir, a carpenter, moved to Innisfail from Saskatchewan in September last year for work.

His girlfriend, Ashley Roberts, stayed behind on the Lac La Ronge First Nation in northern Saskatchewan. Her father, Dale Roberts, who called Cusnir his âson-in-law,â said the younger man was texting his daughter last week to say he loved her, before making a foreboding final message.

Roberts said his daughter urged Cusnir to tell her what was wrong, but he refused.

Cusnir was dead when he was found in his flaming truck, but his death wasnât as a result of the fire. RCMP have not released the cause of death.

Roberts believed Cusnir had became involved with a bad crowd.

âHe just fell in with the wrong group of people, I think. Itâs kind of a mystery to us, too, what he did on his own time.

Cusnir emigrated to Canada from Moldova as a boy. and spent time in Calgary. According to his Facebook profile, he attended Dr. EP Scarlett High School in the cityâs southwest, and worked for eight years at a local renovation company after graduating.

His mother still lives in Calgary, Roberts said, and Cusnir would return to the city to visit her.

The young man had a âgood character,â he said.

âIâve never seen a young guy with such ambition. He was trying to get his own company going.

Cusnir and his daughter dated for about two years, Roberts said.

âIt was a shock to hear (he was dead). My daughterâs pretty torn up about it. Sheâs still upset.

RCMP have asked the public to help piece together Cusnirâs movements prior to his death.

Spokesman Ron Campbell said investigators have no witnesses or suspects and very little information.

âWeâd like to hear from anybody who may have had contact with this individual in the days preceding (his death). We have very little background right now. Thatâs one thing we are struggling with.

Cusnir was known to police, but âonly in a minor way,â Campbell said.

The RCMP Special Tactical Operations team spent Saturday combing the area for further evidence.

An autopsy and inspection of the truck will likely be carried out on Tuesday.

Anyone with information about Cusnir or the case should call 403-227-3341.
