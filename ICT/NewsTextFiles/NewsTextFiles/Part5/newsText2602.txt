There’s the old saying that you hand a man a fish, he eats for one day. Teach a man to fish and he eats for a lifetime. Entrepreneurs are very good at doing all the fishing themselves but often fail miserably at teaching the art of fishing to their staff.

By hogging the rod for themselves, entrepreneurs limit the number of successful catches for the day and deprive employees of a critical skill set. Though rivers and streams are plentiful and capable men and women are yearning to learn the technique, entrepreneurs stifle the success of their teams, creating a very destructive cycle in the workplace.

Some entrepreneurs wield this type of thinking and their big personalities to build a tenacious startup. When these characteristics are left unchecked, however, the entrepreneurs can become a force that might destroy the very stability of their companies.

1. Recognize a leader's impact. Entrepreneurs need to put down the Red Bull. Yes, they have created something out of nothing. They are indeed very capable human beings. Now they must recognize that their strongest skill set, which made them successful, can also make them destructive.

Business owners need to recognize that their job as managers can be done more effectively by properly delegating tasks, shepherding staff during a project’s evolution and encouraging team members to be visionary partners rather than a hive of worker bees. With this employee-employer dynamic, creation and innovation can flow.

2. Think about structure. A company can function as either a single supercomputer or a giant farm of parallel processors. Under the supercomputer model, the company grows only as large as allowed by the power of one computer, namely the entrepreneur. In this scenario, the company can never be larger than this boss.

By finding a healthy balance, where ambition is harnessed and responsibility delegated, the effectiveness of the whole team can soar.
