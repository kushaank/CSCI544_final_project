Ahead of next week's European elections, Sweden's parties remain at odds over whether foreign company operating in Sweden need to do more to help its staff.

The Social Democrats and the Left Party want to force companies to sign Swedish collective agreements or, at the very least, make sure they live up to the general terms of the contracts.

"Regardless of where I come from, ... I should have the same pay, same safe work environment and same working conditions as those who are native Swedes," Marita Ulvskog, the Social Democrats' top EU candidate, tells Radio Sweden.

Currently, posted workers or foreign employees temporarily working in Sweden, aren't covered under the collective agreement between businesses and Swedish unions.

Instead, foreign firm only have to meet certain minimum standards in its host country in areas such as pay, working hours and number of holidays.

Candidates on the right warn that making companies sign Swedish contracts could lead to far-reaching changes which would not be in Sweden's interests. They say staff posted aboard already enjoy basic protection and equal rights under the Union's current rules.

"If we go through with a social protocol, this means the European Court of Justice will interpret it. And that means inviting the court to make decisions regarding the Swedish labor market," the Christian Democrats top candidate Lars Adaktusson says.
