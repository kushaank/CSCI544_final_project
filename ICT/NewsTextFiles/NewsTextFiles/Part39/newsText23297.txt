
New Delhi : YSR Congress chief Jaganmohan Reddy Monday met BJP's prime ministerial nominee Narendra Modi, and said his party will give "issue-based support" to his government.

Asked if his party, which has nine MPs, would join the National Democratic Alliance, Reddy said: "BJP does not require the support of any political party. The fact is that they already have 282 MPs and they don't need the support of any of us."

"Andhra Pradesh wants him (Modi)," he said, adding that his party would extend "issue-based" support to the NDA government.

The YSR Congress chief also submitted a memorandum to Modi, asking him to ensure the promises made for Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are fulfilled.
