
Interesting story from Breitbart about the German government out and out falsifying an IPCC report that criticizes their green subsidy policy as "useless."

Either the German government got the worst translator in history or they are covering up the failure of their policies.

The ministry’s four-page summary of the report contains outright contradictions and falsifications of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommendations, apparently made to hide UN criticism of the way the German government has turned emissions-trading into a cash cow for futile renewable energy projects.

Die Welt said on Sunday that parts of the thousands of pages-long English-language report which the ministry found embarrassing were mistranslated in the government’s “core messages” version released to the German news media and public.

“The UN declares emissions trading an effective instrument that makes subsidies for renewable energy unnecessary. But the German government reverses the conclusion and makes emissions trading the culprit that supposedly ‘constricts the impact of other measures’,” Die Welt reported.

Die Welt said the UN report debunks German green energy as useless.
