
The father of a missing sailor from Southampton says he knows his son James Male and his crew mates are in a life raft, after their yacht started to take on water in the Mid-Atlantic. He said it was a difficult situation for the family.

Graham Male said he is sure, James aged 23; and his colleagues - Andrew Bridge, 21, from Farnham in Surrey; Paul Goslin, 56, and Steve Warren, 52, who are both from Somerset - are out there somewhere.

Mr Male said the men's families are staying positive because they know how professional the missing sailors are.
