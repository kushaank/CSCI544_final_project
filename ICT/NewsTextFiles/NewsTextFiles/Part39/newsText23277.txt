
Three-day delay expected as fire department tests sound insulation products at 24 Farnsworth Street.

The opening of the new Boston offices of the Unitarian Universalist Association, including Beacon Press, has been delayed until Thursday, May 22, as the Boston Fire Department evaluates two products used as sound insulation.

The UUA has been renovating the first three floors of 24 Farnsworth Street for use as its new headquarters since September. It moved staff out of 25 Beacon Street, its historic headquarters, and 41 Mt. Vernon Street late last week.

Limpert said the fire department is requiring additional testing for one sound insulation product and is reviewing the results of tests of another sound insulation product.

Although the Boston offices will remain closed on Tuesday and Wednesday, “most of our Boston-based staff are able to perform major portions of their jobs remotely,” Limpert said. Many UUA staff already work remotely from sites across the country. The UUA’s email and telephone systems are working, although telephone calls may be sent to voicemail with a default prerecorded greeting.

Update 5.21.14: The Boston Fire Department issued the certificate of occupancy Wednesday morning, May 21. Limpert confirmed in an email to staff that the new offices will open at 9:00 Thursday morning.
