
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) - Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe says he's open to the idea of a special legislative session to address health insurance plans for public school employees as long as there's a consensus among lawmakers about it.

Spokesman Matt DeCample said Monday that the governor wants to ensure enough legislators would vote on a bill before deciding to call them back to the state Capitol.

Sen. Jim Hendren says nearly 47,000 employees in public schools would face a 35 percent increase in their health rates unless lawmakers take action. Hendren is the chairman for a task force that was established to study plans for school workers.

House Speaker Davy Carter says he's talking with Senate leadership to see if a special session could happen.
