
An unusual white light in Auckland's sky last night has some wondering if they saw a UFO.

Auckland man Andrew Russell said he saw the light in the sky while waiting in Pt Chevalier for a bus.

"I noticed people stopping their cars by the Z petrol station. Then a girl ran across the road saying 'oh my gosh, did you see that?' I thought she was a drunk actually."

Russell said he saw a "stunning brightly lit white shield shaped light in the sky".

It appeared to be gliding over the NorthWest motorway and was not making a sound.

He thought about 30 people had stopped what they were doing to watch the light.

A Stardome Observatory spokesman said it appeared the object was likely a multi-prop drone.

ea Worth says her husband snapped this looking over the city from Remuera to Glen Innes.
