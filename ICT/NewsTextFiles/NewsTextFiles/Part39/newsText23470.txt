
Senior BJP leader M Venkaiah Naidu on Monday said it is shocking to see that Congress president Sonia Gandhi and party vice-president Rahul Gandhi not having the courtesy of greeting PM-elect Narendra Modi following the massive mandate received by him.

“Though American President, British Prime Minister, scores of Prime Ministers from across the globe, including our neighbours like Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have greeted Narendra Modi, the Congress president and vice-president do not have the courtesy or the basic culture of India to greet the person who has got such a massive mandate,” Naidu told reporters in Hyderabad.

People of the country have punished Congress for its failure to keep up promises, and the corruption, misrule and policy paralysis, he said.
