
Delegates attending the National Conference have said they will not extend the tenure of President Goodluck Jonathan and other elected government officials.

A member of the conference from South-South Chief Okon Osung, who is making the proposal, had on Friday said he had already distributed the proposal to some delegates, including all the 24-members in the Public Finance Committee, headed by a former Governor of Kebbi State, Senator Adamu Aliero.

Some delegates have said it’s uncalled for and that it must be disregarded by their colleagues. One of them, Chief Paul Enebeli, who was a former President of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria, said there was no need for the call and that it was not part of the mandate given to them by President Jonathan.

Another delegate, Prof. Isaac Albert, who said he was astonished when he read about the call, described the action as uncalled for.

“We are here to strengthen the country and not to further cause confusion. We should ignore the call, which I know is part of the personal agenda of some people,” he said.
