
ISLAMABAD: Lawmakers in the Senate on Monday called for forging unity by political and democratic forces for supremacy of Constitution and continuation of democracy to protect the federation and end deprivation of federating units.

Speaking on a motion in the House, the Senators mentioned different happenings of the past and warned that today's Pakistan is a changed Pakistan and any adventurism will be lethal for the federation.

Opening discussion, one of the movers Senator Raza Rabbani urged all political stakeholders to rise above party and personal interests to protect the federal parliamentary system. "We are passing through a transition and for the first time the power has been transferred politically and democratically."

But, he warned if any endeavor is made to bring a technocrat, dictatorial and monarchy to the country, its survival will become difficult and repercussions will be serious.

He cautioned that sectarianism and extremism is flourishing and Islam is being used for furthering a political agenda and all stakeholders will have to unite to cope with this situation.

"Such a situation will increase deprivation and trust deficit resulting in polarization and intolerance to culminate into violence. This situation calls for unity," he added.

Calling for institutionalization of the system, Raza Rabbani said, systematic efforts are being made to dismantle this system and calling the election in question after one year, the Chief Justice and the Parliament are glaring examples of these efforts.

He furthered his argument by quoting examples of making those institutions controversial which are working under constitution as well as airing in-fighting within media and talking of banning media organization.

He called upon political, democratic and progressive forces and other stakeholders for soul searching and stand united for the sake of democracy.
