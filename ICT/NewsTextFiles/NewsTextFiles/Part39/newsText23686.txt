Long Beach residents now have a quicker way to get information in the event of a major disaster through the city’s new disaster preparedness and emergency communications website.

The website, which launched Monday, helps the public stay connected with up-to-date information before, during and after a disaster, officials said.

The website also provides a comprehensive guide to personal and family preparedness, links to other state and federal preparedness websites and information on how to volunteer and donate responsibly to those impacted by a disaster.

“The new website expands on and consolidates the city’s disaster preparedness message into one location, to ensure consistency and ease of use,” Harrison said in a statement.

The new website is available at longbeach.gov/disasterpreparedness .

Residents are advised to prepare to be self-sufficient for at least five days in the event of a large-scale incident.

Residents should create an emergency plan for their home and family, put together an emergency supply kit and make sure all family members know how to contact one another, city officials said.

People are also encouraged to sign up for Community Emergency Response Team training, a free program to train the public how to become self-sufficient during major disasters. For more information, visit longbeach.gov/fire/cert .
