Federal prosecutors in New York on Monday announced charges against the creators of software called Blackshades that hackers around the world allegedly used to hijack hundreds of thousands of computers, allowing them to spy on victims through computer webcams and steal financial information.

In recent days, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and foreign police agencies launched a series of raids in 19 countries, arresting more than 90 people who had purchased the software from the Blackshades website for $40.

Prosecutors allege that Alex Yucel, 24, of Sweden, and Michael Hogue, 23, of Maricopa, Ariz., created the software and sold it to at least 6,000 customers, generating more than $350,000 between September 2010 and April of this year. The software is what experts call a RAT, or remote access tool, that allows people to control computers from a distance.

"We now live in a world where, for just $40, a cybercriminal halfway across the globe can--with just a click of a mouse--unleash a RAT that can spread a computer plague not only on someone's property, but also on their privacy and most personal spaces," said U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, at a news conference Monday. His Manhattan-based office is prosecuting the case.

Mr. Yucel was arrested in November 2013 in Moldova. The Justice Department is seeking his extradition on two counts of computer hacking, each of which carries a punishment of as many as 10 years in prison. Mr. Hogue, who was arrested in Arizona in June 2012 as part of a separate cybercrime operation, has been cooperating with investigators in the Blackshades probe, according to court documents. He pleaded guilty in January 2013 to two counts of hacking in the other case.

A lawyer for Mr. Hogue didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Mr. Yucel, who is in prison in Moldova, couldn't immediately be reached.

Blackshades customers captured computers by tricking victims into clicking on email links and drawing users to websites laden with malware, the FBI agents said in court documents. The victims themselves unwittingly invited their social media contacts to click on links that installed the software, spreading it further.

The software allowed the hackers to remotely activate the victims' web cameras, record their keystrokes and rummage through their files. The hackers could then lock the files and demand a ransom to unlock them. The software included a form ransom note, which was described in court documents unsealed Monday: "Your computer has basically been hijacked, and your private files stored on your computer has [sic] now been encrypted, which means that they are impossible to access."

Prosecutors announced charges against several other men as well.

The government obtained a warrant to search an email account Mr. Yucel used to communicate with Blackshades employees, which led them to individuals who had allegedly purchased the software, including Kyle Fedorek of Stoney Pont, N.Y., whom prosecutors say allegedly used Blackshades to glean credit card and financial accounts numbers from at least 400 victims.

Marlen Rappa, of Middletown Township, N.J., allegedly used Blackshades to spy on and secretly capture images of at least 45 victims through their computers' web cameras and to steal electronic videos and photographs, from approximately 95 victim computers--some of them sexually explicit, according to court documents.

The government also said they've brought charges against Brendan Johnston, of Thousand Oaks, Calif., who allegedly was paid to market Blackshades. The three men were arrested on Sunday and Monday and each charged with computer hacking.

Lawyers for the men couldn't be reached. They were expected to make their initial appearances Monday in federal courts in Los Angeles and Manhattan.
