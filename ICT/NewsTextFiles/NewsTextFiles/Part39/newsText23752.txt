The future of the media is here, it is now, and it will be driven by technology. Journalists, anchors, government leaders and media chieftains will converge in Dubai for the Arab Media Forum starting today to explore new trends as they seek to chart the role of the sector.

The forum is being held under the patronage of His Highness Shaikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, at Mina Al Salam — Madinat Jumeirah.

Egyptian Prime Minister Ebrahim Mahlab will deliver the keynote speech at the forum.

Organisers expect over 2,000 participants at the event, who will discuss and debate the direction the media has to take in a period of rapid changes post the Arab Spring. The plan is to identify essential areas that require development in the industry.

“Creating a platform that gathers the finest of media personalities, intellectuals and executives in the region, the forum will attempt to draw key outlines for advancing the industry in the years to come,” said Mona Al Marri, Director-General of the Government of Dubai Media Office and head of the Arab Media Forum Organising Committee.

She said it was important to raise professional standards in the industry while sticking to creative ideas to meet the requirements of the audience and readers.
