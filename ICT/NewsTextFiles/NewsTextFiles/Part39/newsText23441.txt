
NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) hope of getting a built up office in Delhi has been halted at least for the next five years as the political outfit failed to get the status of a national party. However, it can get a plot to build its own office since the party has been recognized as a state party in the capital.

According to urban development ministry sources, once a political party is recognized as national party by the Election Commission, the Centre is bound to allot a built up office in the national capital. "When their representatives had approached the ministry for allotment of office space we had provided them the detailed norms. They were interested to find whether they could get a space so they could shift immediately," said an official.

He added that AAP being a regional party, it can get a plot. It's learnt that the ministry is considering the option of allotting a plot on Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg.

A political party is recognized as a national party if it secures at least 6% of votes polled in any four or more states to the Lok Sabha or the assembly and in addition, it wins at least four seats in the Lok Sabha.

A party can also get national party status if it wins at least 2% seats in the Lok Sabha (i.e. 11 seats in the House having 543 members), and these members are elected from at least three different states.

AAP won four seats, but ended up getting 6% vote only in Delhi and Punjab. Since the party could not get 11 seats, there is no question of weighing the second option.

Though AAP had contested 443 seats it drew blank in all states except Punjab.
