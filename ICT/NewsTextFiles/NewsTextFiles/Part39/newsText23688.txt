
Pierre-Michel Lasogga has spoken of his relief after scoring a vital goal in Hamburg 's away goals victory in the relegation play-off.

Mirko Slomka's side could only draw 0-0 in the first leg last week against Greuther Furth but battled to a 1-1 draw with the Bavarian outfit on Sunday.

Lasogga scored the vital goal and was delighted that he made a vital contribution after missing game time due to injuries of late.

"I was desperate to help HSV survive in the Bundesliga," the league's official website quotes him as saying.

"I've struggled with injuries these last few months, but I've managed to rediscover the sort of form I was showing before I got injured.

"The most important thing is that we've managed to stay in the league. The team played brilliantly today.

"Furth put us under a lot of pressure after the equaliser, but we hung on in there and we're delighted to be in the top flight next season."
