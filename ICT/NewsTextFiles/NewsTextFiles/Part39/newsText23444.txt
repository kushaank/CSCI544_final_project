BANGKOK--Thailand's acting prime minister discussed the country's political crisis with a group of senators on Monday and said his government won't resign.

Acting Prime Minister Niwattumrong Boonsongpaisan told two representatives of the Thai Senate that the cabinet is willing to cooperate with the upper house but won't step down because that might violate the constitution, said Sen. Wanchai Sornsiri, the spokesman of the Senate's coordinating panel.

On Friday, the senators said the country needs a government with full authority to conduct political reform. They said the Senate would move to appoint a new government if the cabinet stepped down, but stopped short of calling on it to do so.

The cabinet has operated in a caretaker capacity with limited power since former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra dissolved the lower house last year in a failed bid to ease the political crisis. A new government can't normally be named until there are elections, which antigovernment demonstrators have vowed to block unless political reforms come first.

"After being informed of the government's clear stance like this, the Senate will move on to other plans. We have backup plans that can be implemented within this week," Mr. Wanchai told reporters.

Earlier this month, the country's Constitutional Court removed Ms. Yingluck from office. It said she abused her power by removing the country's national-security adviser, Tawin Pleansri, after she was elected prime minister in 2011. This enabled the country's then-police chief to take on that role, which in turn allowed the brother of Mr. Thaksin's ex-wife to become Thailand's police chief.

Protesters says her removal doesn't go far enough because Mr. Niwattumrong is a member of her party.

Antigovernment protesters say they are making their final push to oust the government and install an unelected prime minister and government. They have promised to call off their rallies if they are not successful by May 26, following six months of street demonstrations.

Thailand's political crisis began in 2006, when Yingluck's brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was toppled by a military coup.

Mr. Thaksin, a former telecommunications billionaire, remains highly popular among the poor in the north and northeast, and parties controlled by him have won every national election since 2001.
