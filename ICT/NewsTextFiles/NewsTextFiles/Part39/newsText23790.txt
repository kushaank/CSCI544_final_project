
The rise of Ukip in recent years has been a textbook case of the challenger brand. But the party has had one key advantage: voter apathy. Of the 47m registered voters in the UK, only 35 per cent went to the polling stations during the last European elections. While this presents a tough communications context, it also brings opportunities.

Of course, Ukip’s strategy has been far from exemplary. By embracing controversy, the party may have deterred wavering protest voters, not yet fully committed to its cause. Yet as the debate over the party’s “extremism” rages on, a key lesson emerges. “Many members of the public are not too far to the left or right of centre – but some are. As I always say to newer members of the industry: digital is just a channel. Just because you watch YouTube, that is not to say everyone does. In this industry, you have to look outside your own universe of one to understand what other people do and how they think,” Nelson says.

And Jon Forsyth of Adam&EveDDB thinks the appeal lies in the “live, every day ‘fight’ the campaign has to deliver.” But can political campaign strategies really be applied to brands? The experiences of Mark Penn, former Bill Clinton aide and more recently head of advertising at Microsoft (where he drove the widely-criticised Scroogled – a negative-advertising campaign aimed at Google), suggest not. Penn believes that if brands or politicians can get their message to the market first, they will get closer to the people. “It works in politics. But when trying to sell a product, the consideration set and time required are often very different. That war room approach may not have worked for Microsoft,” Nelson says.
