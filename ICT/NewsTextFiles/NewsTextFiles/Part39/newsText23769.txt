
I really enjoyed Shawn Reeder’s letter suggesting a revenue-neutral carbon tax. My country of origin, Sweden, enacted a carbon tax early on in 1991, as well as other measures to combat climate change. In Sweden, almost all electricity is generated from CO2-free sources, and the carbon footprint of the average Swede is less than a third of that of the average American’s. I’ve spoken to many Swedes who are very frustrated with the United States for not doing enough to bring down the large per-capita carbon footprint of Americans.

A revenue-neutral carbon tax would help preserve the planet for future generations and would have a minimal or positive impact on the economy. It would not raise taxes. A revenue-neutral carbon tax would also be an easy free-market-based approach for the United States to gain back some international respect on environmental issues.
