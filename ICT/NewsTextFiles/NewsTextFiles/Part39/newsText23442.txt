
The upcoming congressional midterm elections in November are shaping up to be a battle for the heart and soul of our country, and are potentially the most important elections of your lifetime.

About 60 percent of all eligible voters vote in the presidential elections, yet historically less than half of that percentage vote in non-presidential midterm elections. The president’s main powers are to create a budget based on his or her stances, to sign or veto a bill, and to enforce laws. Congress controls how much funding goes into each aspect of government spending, and amends laws as needed. I can’t stress enough the importance of these midterm elections, and urge all my fellow Democrats in the 16th Congressional District to vote on Nov. 4. I have met Randall Olsen, D-Ill., and have come to believe he the best candidate to represent us in Congress.

But don’t take my word for it; check out his campaign website electrolsen.com and see for yourself. I also believe it is important to get involved by volunteering or making donations when possible. Remember, if you don’t vote, someone else will make the decision for you.
