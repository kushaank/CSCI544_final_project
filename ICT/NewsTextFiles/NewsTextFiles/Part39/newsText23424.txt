
GEORGE TOWN,  May 19 (Bernama) -- The Penang State Legislative Assembly has introduced an assessment system to evaluate the performance of its assemblymen, especially during debate sessions.

State Assembly Speaker Law Choo Kiang said members of the public, media, non-governmental organisations and students would get the chance to evaluate the performance of the assemblymen by filling in the assessment forms made available at the assembly hall during the sitting.

"This is the first time we adopt this method and I believe we are the first State Assembly in the country to have introduced the system.

"However, as there is no precedent case and we don't have any reference, we will begin implementing the assessment system on a dry run mode," he told reporters at the assembly hall lobby in George Town, Monday.

He said the assessment form would comprise four main areas of evaluation, namely the quality of debate, value of perspective, problem solving and professional ethics.

Law also targeted 100 forms to be filled in at the initial stage of the implementation, and if the dry-run succeeded, the system would be expanded to online assessment system.

He said the findings from the assessment would be discussed with the assemblymen so that the quality of their debates and their personal performances could be improved.

However, he said the findings would not be made public as it would be collected in the dry-run mode.
