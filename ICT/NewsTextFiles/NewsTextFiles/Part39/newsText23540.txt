
Speaker of the House Bill Howell is crusading to block Medicaid expansion in Virginia required by the Affordable Care Act (not "Obamacare").

Mr. Howell says that Virginia should "explore an alternative approach to covering those in the coverage gap," yet he has  never to my knowledge championed any sort of health care reform. His desperate reaction is  motivated purely by the desire to see the ACA fail.

While he fights tooth and nail to maintain the status quo where "health care" corporations put profits first and patients dead last, the commonwealth is losing millions of dollars of federal money going to other states that have accepted the ACA--money that should rightfully be coming to Virginia to help the 400,000 fellow Virginians who have no health care coverage.

The people of the commonwealth deserve bipartisan leadership that propels them toward a more healthy future, not reactionary in-fighting that holds them back.
