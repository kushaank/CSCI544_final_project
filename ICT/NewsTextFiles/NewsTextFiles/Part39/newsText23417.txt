
When: 4 p.m. Monday.

Where: City Council Chambers, 405 Sixth St.

The council will decide whether to accept donation of the sculptures.

The project is planned for the east side of the Martin Luther King Jr. Transportation Center at the corner of Fifth and Nebraska streets.

A plaque explaining the achievements of the represented individuals would accompany each sculpture, as well as a bar code visitors could scan with their smartphones to access additional information.

An arch made of multiple steel beams, twisted into various shapes, would accompany the sculptures. The 23-foot tall, 50-foot wide arch would be illuminated at night.

A grassy area on Nebraska Street would allow visitors to sit and enjoy the parkâ€™s architecture and sculptures.

Avery and representatives of the Celebrating Community Foundation, as well as council members, said the project goals are not only to raise awareness about dedicated Siouxland residents but also to grow pride in the community and enhance public and private partnerships.
