
With Memorial Day weekend kicking off summer for millions of Americans this weekend, Disneyland is squeezing families with a price increase.

New prices posted quietly to the park's Web site without fanfare now quote a price of $96 for a one-day, one-park ticket to Disneyland or California Adventures. That's a $4 increase.

A one-day park hopper pass giving access to both Disneyland and California Adventures has been raised $13 to $150.

Southern California annual pass, a popular option that gets holders into both parks on Sundays.

The Southern California Select annual pass is still available for purchase at $289 but cannot be used on weekends.

A Deluxe annual pass which can be used on Saturdays and Sundays will now run $519.

The most expensive annual pass is the Premium at $699, which includes cost of parking and has no blockout days.

Parking will also cost more, with a single day running $17 for cars and motorcycles.

Unlike prior cost increases, this week's was not accompanied by an advance warning from Disneyland.

The cost increase comes only five days before the park's 'Rocky Your Disney Side' 24-hour event.

The park will open at 6 a.m. Friday and close on 6 a.m. Saturday morning, according to the Disneyland site.

'It's really sad becauseâ€¦ with families, where can you go?' said disappointed parent  Rita Webb, outside of the Anaheim theme park. 'This is  supposed to be a trip for kids and families.'
