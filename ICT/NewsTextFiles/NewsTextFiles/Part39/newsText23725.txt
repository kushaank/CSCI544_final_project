
Republican gubernatorial candidate Rob Astorino received the support of Republican Brookhaven Town Supervisor Edward Romaine during a Monday news conference where both touted the need for economic development in New York’s suburbs.

Astorino joined Romaine and Brookhaven council members Jane Bonner, a Conservative, and Kevin LaValle, a Republican, on a tour of the All-Star Arena Long Island, a 50,000 square foot facility currently under construction, that will offer indoor playing fields in what was once a shuttered shopping plaza in Coram.

The appearance was Astorino’s second on Long Island since earning the GOP nomination at the party’s state convention on Thursday. Astorino, Westchester's county executive, spoke at the Oyster Bay Republican Club on Sunday .

At both events, he stressed the important role large suburban counties like Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester will play in his effort to defeat Democratic Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.

Astorino said Suffolk, Nassau and the Hudson Valley were “not living up” to their “potential economically” and touted revitalization projects underway in Westchester County, including a plan to add a recreational sporting facility on the property of the Playland amusement park in Rye.

A State Democratic Committee spokesman did not immediately return an e-mail seeking comment.
