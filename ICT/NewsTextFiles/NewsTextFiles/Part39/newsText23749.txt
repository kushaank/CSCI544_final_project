
The days of carrying bottles of suncream to the beach could be over, as the world's first drinkable SPF is launched.

Harmonised H20 UV claims to provide holidaymakers with up to factor 30 protection, meaning sunbathers could be able to soak up the rays for longer without fear of getting burned.

Once ingested, the product's liquid molecules vibrate on the skin, cancelling out 97 per cent of UVA and UVB rays, according to US company Osmosis Skincare.

The liquid sunscreen - which claims to be the world's first - is on sale now, costing Â£17 for a 100ml bottle.

There are two varieties available - 'tanning' and 'non tanning', the former allows users achieve a tan while being protected from harmful sun rays, the company states.

However, the US company does admit that none of its claims have been approved by the Federal Drugs Agency.

'Take second dose if still in sun 3 hours after first dose.

'For extended intense exercise outdoors or if taking sun-sensitizing medications, use alternate protection after 30-40 minutes.'

'When it comes to an issue as serious as preventing skin cancer, customer testimonials cannot take the place of scientific evidence, for which this particular product cannot provide.

'Children's skin is particularly sensitive and therefore more prone to damage from UV rays, so it is even more important to stick to the tried and tested methods of sun protection when it comes to protecting their skin.'
