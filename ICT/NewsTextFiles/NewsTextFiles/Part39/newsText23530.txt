UNITED NATIONS (TRNS) – Voters in Switzerland rejected a plan to increase the country’s minimum wage to 22 Francs ($25) an hour on Sunday, a setback for campaigners hoping to reduce the landlocked nation’s income inequality.

According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, high prices in Switzerland would restrict the spending power from that wage to $14 an hour, but that would still top the adjusted rates in Luxembourg ($10.66) and France ($10.60). The United States, at an adjusted $7.11 per hour, is the tenth-highest minimum wage globally.

More than half of the Swiss electorate defeated the wage increase, but a number of corporations operating the country have announced plans to raise the minimum wage for their employees up to 22 Francs.

Among them is Swedish multinational clothing retailer H&M, but don’t expect to see a similar hike the company’s employees in the U.S., where its sales associate earn roughly $10.50 an hour, according to wage aggregator Glassdoor.com.

Representatives for H&M in the United States did not respond to a request to comment on its wages or the company’s actions in Switzerland.
