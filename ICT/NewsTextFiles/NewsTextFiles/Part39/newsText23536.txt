
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said that Georgia Republican primary Senate candidate Karen Handel is being ganged up on by "the good old boys" because they are scared of the "conservative change" she could bring.

"There is a reason the good old boys are ganging up on Karen — she threatens their status quo," Palin, the 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee, wrote on her Facebook page Monday morning.

"They know that she will shake it up in Washington," she said of the former Georgia secretary of state. "Change scares them, and that is why they've tossed everything including the kitchen sink her way. In Washington she will bring positive conservative change just like she did in Georgia, and she won't be afraid to call them like she sees them."

Palin said that the midterm elections this November "are about who we send to Washington to help restore our country after six years of a disastrous administration . . . . It's about who we trust to keep their word to fight for conservative principles and grow the conservative movement at the same time."

If a candidate doesn't get a majority of votes cast Tuesday, there will be a runoff election in July between the top two finishers.
