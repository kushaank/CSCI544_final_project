
Falana who was the guest speaker at the 18th National Delegates Conference of Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) held at the University of Ibadan, described the increment as immoral and illegal.

He added that it was an act of terrorism for a state government to increase fees beyond the reach of the children of the poor.

He argued that it was unjustifiable that the civil servants at Alausa who worked for the state to generate over N20 billion Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) monthly but earn N18, 000 as minimum wage will not be able to train their children in the Lagos State University.

According to him, such a policy may lead to stealing and corruption as he noted that unless civil servants steal, it will be impossible for their children to access LASU.

He informed that a federal high court has given a judgement ordering the federal government to establish Nigeria Education Bank for the children of the poor to access higher education in Nigeria.

While calling on Nigeria Labour Congress and the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) to join the struggle towards ensuring that the government implements the judgement and Nigeria Education Bank Act of 1993, Falana stated that those coming up with anti-masses policies in education benefited from government scholarships, loans and bursary awards of the 1970s.

â€œIf you are increasing fees beyond the reach of the children of the poor, that is Boko-Haram because the action is against western education.

I ponder when people are made to believe APC is the solution. They have been in Lagos state since 1999 and I ask;

3. I bet you also confirm that Lagos ranked 5th or so in WAEC performance is attributable to over 90% from Private schools.
