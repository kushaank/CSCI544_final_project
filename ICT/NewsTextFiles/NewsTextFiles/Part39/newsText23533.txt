LEELANAU COUNTY, MI – Police are investigating after a woman called U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow’s Traverse City office and allegedly issued threats if the lawmaker did not stop illegal workers from taking U.S. jobs.

The caller threatened Jamaican workers she said were hired by Homestead Resort, Leelanau County sheriff’s deputies said.

“The caller asked Stabenow to stop illegals from coming into the country and taking away jobs from local workers,” police said in a statement.

The threats came in Friday, May 16. The chief of staff for Stabenow, D-Lansing, called police.

Investigators tracked the caller’s cell phone to an Oregon subscriber, but learned it had been used in the Cedar and Maple City areas. The phone was being used by a 61-year-old woman who lives in Leelanau County’s Kasson Township.

The woman allegedly made admissions to police. Police do not believe that the woman had the means to carry out the threat. She was not arrested. Police will turn over reports for review by prosecutors.

Police contacted Homestead representatives and were told that housekeeping jobs had been advertised locally, with “Michigan Works!” involved.

The resort received only one job application, however.

That person failed to show for the interview.
