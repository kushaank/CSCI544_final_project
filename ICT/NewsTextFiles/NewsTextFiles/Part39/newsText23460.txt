
NEW DELHI (AFP) - India’s Sonia and Rahul Gandhi offered to resign on Monday after leading the once-dominant Congress party to its worst-ever election defeat last week, only for colleagues to insist the dynasty stay in place.

Congress won just 44 seats in the parliamentary election for 543 seats as the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept to power with the first majority in 30 years.

Sonia, the 67-year-old Congress party president, entrusted campaigning for the first time to her son and vice-president Rahul, whose lacklustre performance failed to convince voters as Congress sought a third term in power.
