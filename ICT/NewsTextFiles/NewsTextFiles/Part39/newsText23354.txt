
Allies of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell are lining up the heavy artillery for his general-election campaign.

With McConnell poised to crush conservative challenger Matt Bevin in Tuesday’s Kentucky GOP primary, a pair of outside groups supporting the senator are poised to begin a more-than-$5-million effort to take down his almost-certain Democratic opponent, Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes.

Beginning this Wednesday – the day after the primary – the super PAC Kentuckians for Strong Leadership will launch a $575,000 ad campaign targeting Grimes. The ads will run until June 2.

The nonprofit Kentucky Opportunity Coalition will pick up from there, spending nearly $4.7 million on ads between June 5 and August 27.

A source familiar with the group’s plans confirmed the imminent ad campaign and indicated that this heavy spending would continue to grow.

The ads are expected to focus on Grimes’ relationship with national Democrats, including President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, both of whom are polarizing and unpopular figures in conservative-leaning Kentucky.

Grimes senior adviser Jonathan Hurst dismissed the coming onslaught and said in a statement that Grimes was building momentum with an upbeat message.

The Kentucky Senate race has already attracted millions of dollars in outside spending, both by these pro-McConnell groups and from the national Democratic group Senate Majority PAC. Because of McConnell’s high profile as the Senate GOP leader, the race will likely be the most expensive federal contest of 2014.
