
Construction firms added jobs in 39 states and the District of Columbia over the past 12 months and in 29 states and D.C. between March and April according to an analysis today by the Associated General Contractors of America of Labor Department data. Association officials welcomed the mostly positive figures but cautioned that the industry’s recovery remained fragile, with construction employment levels below prior peaks in every state except North Dakota.

After Florida, California added the most new construction jobs for the year (39,000 jobs, 6.2 percent), followed by Texas (23,900 jobs, 3.9 percent) and Pennsylvania (9,800 jobs, 4.3 percent).

After New Jersey, the states with the highest percentage decline in construction employment were New Mexico, West Virginia (-3.7 percent, -1,300 jobs) and Alabama.

Texas (7,500 jobs, 1.2 percent) added the most jobs between March and April, followed by California (7,100 jobs, 1.1 percent); Pennsylvania (6,500 jobs, 2.8 percent) and Florida (4,800 jobs, 1.2 percent). Rhode Island (5.5 percent, 900 jobs) had the highest percentage increase for the month, followed by Iowa (4.6 percent, 3,100 jobs); the District of Columbia (4.5 percent, 600 jobs) and Pennsylvania.

Maine (-3.4 percent, -900 jobs) experienced the highest monthly percentage decline, followed by New Mexico (-2.7 percent, -1,100 jobs); West Virginia (-2.1 percent, -700 jobs) and New Jersey.

Association officials noted that Congressional action on vital infrastructure measures could help sustain the industry’s recovery. A Senate committee approved new surface transportation legislation that will make it easier for state and local officials to fund road, bridge and transit construction projects. Meanwhile, a House-Senate conference committee released a final version of a Water Resources Reform & Development Act that will fund waterways, port, dam and other important infrastructure projects once it becomes law.
