
The disgracing defeat in the 16th Lok Sabha Elections has sent the grand old  Indian National Congress (INC) party in a tizzy. The party is not able to recuperate from the huge loss at the hands of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The heavy defeat has resulted in a urgent Congress Working Committee (CWC) meet today at 10, Janpath to analyse and chart future course of action. The INC has been reduced to a mere 44-seat party; as it now finds itself 11 seat short of the official 55-seats mark to be the principal opposition.

The CWC is a 15-member body selected wholly from the INC party. The meet is slated to discuss the core issues relating to the poll debacle under the leadership of Congress vice-president, Rahul Gandhi . There are speculations of the complete revamp of the CWC as a show of taking collective responsibility for the big loss. While the talk of every member of the CWC will be resigning in order to save Rahul from the blame of the defeat.

Sonia Gandhi, Congress President, had conceded its defeat on the result day and had accepted the responsibility. If rumours are to be believed, Sonia has decided to hand over the reigns to Priyanka Vadra and not Rahul. Priyanka’s late entry and limited exposure in the later stages of the  elections had cost them big.

Whatever the speculations be, the Congress party has a huge task at hand. Should they finally look behind the Gandhi family (which is impossibly impossible); or should they let Priyanka take over the reigns from Rahul. Will the CWC witness a huge revamp? Or do we see members themselves resigning in order to save Rahul? Or we will see the young leaders other than the Gandhi clan are bestowed bigger and responsible roles.

By evening, there are going to be major announcements. It’s said that patience pays off sweetly, well wait till evening and we are in for some exciting news..
