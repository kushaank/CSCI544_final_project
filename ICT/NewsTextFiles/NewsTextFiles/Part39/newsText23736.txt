
UKIP Leader Nigel Farage was forced to issue further apologies today for his controversial comments about Romanian immigrants.

Speaking to ITV News' Political Correspondent Carl Dinnen whilst out on the campaign trail in Kent, Farage emphasised that people "shouldn't be concerned, but they probably are concerned, particularly if they live in London."

"I don't want us to live in a country where people have to be concerned." He added.

"The reason people are concerned is they know, because they have read in the newspapers - the very same newspapers that are now criticising me who run big double-paged spreads saying there is a crime wave in London coming from Romania." He also said.
