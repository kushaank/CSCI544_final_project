
An overwhelming majority of Kentucky voters say the state should not spend $80 million revamping Rupp Arena and the attached convention center.

Butler believes those who were polled did not get an accurate description of the “entire financial plan” because of the way the question was presented.

The poll also showed similar feelings on the project across party lines.  72 percent of Democrats and 77 percent of Republicans polled said the city should find some other way to fund the project besides using state money.
