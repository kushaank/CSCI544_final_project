
A former NTV reporter has put KTN’s Linda Oguttu on the spot over the anchor’s recent move to introduce her baby girl live on air on her return to TV.

Albert Gachiri reckons that the ravishing Linda, wasted precious time trying to show her baby to the world. On his blog, Journalism Dry Cleaner, the renowned journalist described motherhood as a private affair that most people are not interested in.

The experience of motherhood is very special, to many women. A newly-born baby is a source of so much joy and cause for celebration. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to share the good news with all and sundry. But…at the prime(st) of time…in a live news broadcast…on national TV? That’s far from taking it too far. It’s nearer to near-self-interest.

Yes. Words cannot even adequately express the motherhood phenomenon. The fact that it’s extraordinary can hardly be disputed.

It is not, and forever will not be the first time for it to happen!

This piece of good news as is, I beg to move, is not newsworthy.
