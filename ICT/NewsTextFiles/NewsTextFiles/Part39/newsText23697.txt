
KINGSTON, Jamaica -- Students from 350 primary schools across the island will on Tuesday, May 20 participate in the 21st Butterkist National Primary School’s Mathematics Competition at 22 centres.

Last year Emile Bain of Mona Heights Primary School emerged the national champion with a score of 97 per cent.

The competition, which was first held in 1992, seeks to promote excellence in mathematics at the primary level. Several of the past winners have gone on to excellence in the subject and their chosen careers.

Butterkist will recognise and reward the national champion, the 14 parish champions, and their teachers at a special awards ceremony on June 20, 2014 at the Knutsford Court Hotel in Kingston.
