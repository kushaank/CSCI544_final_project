
Although he's not in the U.S. Senate, he has been accused of using his contacts in Washington to derail a major bill sponsored by his would-be opponent in November, U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.

Shaheen had put forth an energy reform proposal with what appeared to be bipartisan support, so its deadlock demise is a tough pill to swallow for New Hampshire's incumbent senator.

"I think it's what people don't like about Washington," Shaheen said. "People want us to work together to get things done. This is a bill that would have created 200,000 jobs."

In Manchester, during a Women for Scott Brown campaign event, Brown laughed off the accusation.

"They're blaming me, apparently while I'm driving around in my truck in New Hampshire, I apparently derailed a bill in Washington," Brown said. "I have this amazing power, I guess."

After the event, Brown reiterated that he didn't advocate against the bill.

"No I didn't, and I find it actually sad in Washington that when there are failures, that they try to look outside themselves and try to blame other people for this," he said.

Shaheen said she will continue to push for the passage of legislation that she believes is critical to the country's energy future.

Brown, meanwhile, said the Senate needs to move forward with a straight up-or-down vote on the Keystone pipeline project.
