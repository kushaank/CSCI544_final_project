
The White House is expected to nominate Shaun Donovan, current secretary of Department of Housing and Urban Development, to be the next director of the Office of Management and Budget. If picked, he’d have to be confirmed by the Senate, but the low-profile role has a number of challenges. Here are a few.

1) The budget. The budget wars have quieted, after a temporary truce earlier this year that funded government operations through September. But, even though neither party anticipates another shutdown later this year, Congress will still need to pass a law (or laws) to pay the government’s bills beginning in October. The White House could allow Congress to negotiate this spending bill, or the OMB chief could become directly involved.

2) Taxes. A year ago, both parties held out some hope that Congress might move on a sweeping rewrite of the tax code. That proved to be too heavy of a lift, but there is still an open debate about tweaking or changing smaller parts, such as certain business tax breaks. The OMB chief, and likely Treasury Secretary, would factor into any of these talks. Tax talks are virtually always complicated and always have economic and political consequences.

3) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . This would be right in Mr. Donovan’s wheelhouse. One of the most active public policy debates in Washington now is what to do with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , huge mortgage-finance giants that have been run through a federal conservatorship since 2008. There is no shortage of public and private groups who are trying to sway the future shape of Fannie and Freddie, and Mr. Donovan and OMB would likely play a role in any White House strategy going forward. These companies also have big budget implications for the U.S., as their dividends to the government have helped tamp down the deficit in the past 12 months.

4) Keeping the trains running. Although the OMB director often gets more attention for the “budget” part of the job, its arguably the “management” role where he or she can have the most input. Current OMB chief, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, played a lead role in determining government operations during the partial shutdown last October . The OMB chief plays a type of clearinghouse role for most rules and regulations that come out of various agencies.
