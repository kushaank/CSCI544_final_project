
Judging by social media, many young voters are concerned that they may not be getting who they voted for in the May 7th General Election. One party leader will not be taking up her seat in Parliament, and a number of others have gone off to do other things.

In juxtaposition, DA leader Helen Zille will be sworn in as the Premier of the Western Cape because she was her party's Premier candidate. The voters will be getting exactly who they voted for.

Amidst the confusion on the ground, it is important to understand this is not about the merits of the stellar personalities concerned. The problem is structural and is a result of our strict party-list system of proportional representation.

When our electoral system was adopted in 1994, it was designed to promote a strong and stable party system. This was why the anti-defection clause, modeled on a similar clause in the constitution of India preventing MPs crossing the floor to other parties, was crafted. This was understandable given our divided history and the need to establish a functioning parliament as the country's premier public square.

However, parliament slowly became solidified and debate froze over time. Power was increasingly concentrated in the hands of party managers. A distinct lack of, what Robert Kennedy called, "a quality of the imagination" took hold. ‘Cut and thrust' debate today remains the exception, not the rule. Many MPs across party lines are reluctant to examine complex public policy issues using evidence-based data and tools.

As an aside, one of the consequences has been that a serious parliamentary non-partisan research capability has not been built up. In most democracies, a MP is able to ask a parliamentary researcher a question or for a research brief. Quickly - usually within a few days - they receive a comprehensive response that is not filtered through the lens of a party ideologue.

Here, parliament's library is poorly stocked, and usually empty. While it is true that parliament's resources are scarce, South Africa cannot afford to skimp on independent quality research and information. While this is in itself not causal, it is a symptom of a system that is not working. iPads are not enough.

The diminished role of parliament over the last twenty years has sidelined legislators as drivers of public policy. Now, public policy largely emanates from the executive of the governing party of the day. Then parliament rubber stamps it.

This is why few private members bills have been tabled over the last twenty years. Those that are tabled are usually proposed by party leaders who are already established as ‘personalities' in the public square.

However, sometimes in life it is the proverbial ‘tricky customer' who sees what no one else does. There is an increasing body of academic evidence that public administrations are characterised by ‘group think'. This was a constant theme I looked at in case studies about the Anglo-U.S. intervention in Iraq at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government a few years ago.

The expected outcome or decision predetermines the decision-making process. The most senior, charismatic or the loudest voice inhibits the dissenting voice. This is why we need a strong parliament to bring out the best in the executive, as well as to be the place where public policy alternatives are born on the opposition benches (and within the ranks of the governing party itself).

MPs' individuality has been stifled in another way. In other democracies, they are accountable to a specific, geographically defined constituency. They raise their constituents' concerns in parliament directly with the head of government or ministers. It might be about a hospital closure, or a large business's relocation, a poor performing school, or even an individual's plight - even an illegal resident or a political refugee. This makes, to use the famous quote of the former Speaker in the U.S. Congress, Tip o'Neill, "all politics local".

A few MPs like the DA's David Maynier and Dene Smuts, and the IFP's Mario Ambrosini have gained a reputation for becoming experts on specific public policy issues. They were the undisputed stars of the last parliament. But, interestingly, no member has become well-known for taking up the cause of a specific community. In a liberal democracy, it is equally important that the voices of the minorities, and even deeply unpopular causes, are championed.

The elegance of a defined constituency is that it offers protection to the MP. If a MP takes up their community's or a constituent's case, they know they cannot be easily silenced. Of course, party discipline is a prerequisite of representation. A MP should also be equipped to defend their party's policies with vigour and flair.

This was the system recommended by the commission chaired by the late Dr Fredrick Van Zyl Slabbert, and former leader of the Progressive Federal Party (PFP). The commission drew upon the knowledge of experts in electoral reform from around the world and was widely representative of civil society, as well as political parties.

This is not an AGANG, DA or ANC matter. The issue of electoral reform is bigger than party politics.

When the then Minister of Home Affairs, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, mandated the Van Zyl Slabbert Commission, he stressed that "the electoral system is that which constitutes the terms and conditions of the contract between the voters and the electorate". The guiding principle was, and remains, that "no one single party can write a contract by itself and impose it on another".

In terms of upholding accountability and democracy, the only complicated bit of the mixed electoral system is the mathematics. Basically, under a mixed electoral system, different formulas are used simultaneously to allocate seats from a single election.

The mixed electoral system is used in many countries from Germany to the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament. And we already use it here at the local government level. There are various models such as the Additional Member System (AMS) or the Alternative Vote (AV) top-up.

The majority of MPs (up to 85%) would be elected on an individual constituency basis, with the remainder elected on a corrective ‘top-up' basis. This would significantly reduce the disproportionality and the geographical "divisiveness" - or spread - of South Africa.

The voter (x) casts two votes: one for a candidate to serve as an electoral district (or constituency) representative (person y) and one for a party list of candidates (party z).

The final seat tally for each party is calculated by subtracting the number of district (or constituency) seats (y) that each party wins from the total number of party (z) list seats to which it is entitled: that is according to the percentage of the vote it achieved.

So if a party wins, for example, ten constituencies, it may be allocated an extra four seats according to the votes it received in other constituencies across the nation, which it did not win.

The party list seats (z), therefore, are used to correct - or by ‘topping up' - any disproportionality produced in the single-member plurality (or majority) seats (y).

The big advantage of a mixed electoral system is that it uses single-member districts (or constituencies) and, therefore, retains a strong link between representatives and their constituencies.

So here, the onus lies with the political party to ensure that both representatives work as hard as each other.

Another drawback is that it can give third parties disproportionate influence by giving them the balance of power, and can make it difficult for one party to govern. But this continental European scenario seems unlikely in the SA context.

Ironically, if the system had been introduced in the last parliament, the present party of government might have received more seats. But the point is that the fibre of democracy would have been strengthened. We can only hope that in the fifth parliament MPs will rise above party politics to change how we do politics.

Jon Cayzer is speechwriter in the Office of the DA Leader. He writes in his private capacity.

Parliament in African kakistocracies is just for show.

To show the rest of the world that Africa takes democracy seriously.

It's all a sham of course.

Pity you do not understand this.

Most ANC politicians cannot string two words together . .more logically except the standard phrase 'give me"

1. It will kill small parties who may want to represent issues than constituencies.

Zimbabwe has a constituency based system. It is not the system, its the people abusing it.

But it should have been tabled 25 years ago. The DA will not get this change done (nor do they practice the concept internally) and things as they are work out just fine for the ANC. As political theory it's a good proposal, as political practice it will . .more never see the light of day.

DIRECT DEMOCRACY is a government system that ensures accountability to you, the voter!

Note to politicians. This describes the system we operate under. This does not necessarily describe you. If you are happy with the current system, this could describe you.

Our current constitution and political system in South Africa is considered better than pre 1994 but worse than other constitutions throughout the world in its content and application.

- The system lacks in accountability.

- The primary allegiance of politicians is to their political party and not to us, the voters!

- Regretfully, the 50% of the local government councillors with an identifiable constituency remains unaccountable to the electorate.

- The legitimate shareholders of South Africa, province and local government.

- The employers and paymasters of our politicians.

As such, we demand control over our politicians and regular accountability.

We are determined to have, like the Swiss, a direct democratic system where laws are passed with the electorate in final control, if they decide to exercise that right.

1. Adopt a politician, preferably one at each level of government.

5. Present the document below to each candidate politician and political party, negotiate the terms and insist they sign to show their commitment to direct democracy.

- Recognize that the voters pay my salary through payment of taxes and rates,.

- Commit myself to regular and effective consultation with the voting public through public meetings and continuous communication via the press, radio stations or in person.

- Will only vote in accordance to the best interest of the voters who elected me, who may be polled by means of a referendum similar in format to that used for petitions.

- Will ensure that the wishes of my constituency are effectively communicated and advocated for, in and at all levels of government.

- Will apply my total energy, ability and powers to uphold  the laws and ensure that voters receive efficient and effective service deliveries.

- Am and remain accountable for my performance to the voters only.

- Fully agree that the registered . .more voters of a ward may remove me from office (excluding proportional representation). A petition of 25% of the number of voters who voted in the last election within my ward or designated constituency is needed to effect my removal.

- Accept that all registered voters are free to sign, including those who did not vote in the last election. The recall petition may only be initiated after 6 months have elapsed since the last election.

- Understand that, should an election be called, the recall process will be cancelled.

- Will promote legislation at all levels of government and changes to the South African Constitution in order to realise  a system of constituency with top up proportional representation, recall, referendum initiative and Direct Democracy.

3. Those eggs will become EAGLES and fly into the distance creating more eggs.

4. Soon there will be a massive flock of EAGLES, spreading the word and helping us all to FLY TO TRUE FREEDOM.

It will not kill small parties because pverall proportionality is guaranteed by the Constitution. If the IFP, NFP, UDM and VF Plus get 2,4%, 1,57%, 1% and 0,9% of the total number of votes, they still have exactly that % of seats in parliament.

The . .more only difference is that some MPs will be directly elected and others will be appointed from the party llist.

1. The hegemonic power of the ANC is a direct result of the current electoral System - or at least, the electoral system enhances it artificially. The ANC and SACP pool their candidates on a single list, under the banner of the ANC, and thereby achives an . .more unfair advantage over other parties that fight elections only on a single party ticket. The ANC would have fallen below the 50% margin in Gauteng if it were not for the SACP members listed on its Party list.

2. The racial voting pattern has become much more tempered in this election. In two further elections it will probably be phased out.

John Cayzer and many commentators appear to be of the opinion that the problems in Sefrican governance lies in the system. This is not correct and an over simplification.

The anti-Afrikaner establishment campaigned for years to replace what they . .more considered a bad system (non-universal suffrage) with a "good" system than was primarily based on universal suffrage, and now that they have achieved it they are extremely disappointed.

A "good" system does not automatically ensures good governance.

A "bad" system run by "good" people can provide better governance than a "good" system run by "bad" people.

It stands to reason that a good system run by good people will provide better governance.

The trick is to devise a system that will ensure that it can not be hijacked by bad people. Universal suffrage in a centrally governed unitary state is a recipe for failure. It is an open invitation for political hijackers, as the ANC has demonstrated so well. Devolution of power, recognition of cultural identity, group rights are the way to go.

- a low threshold allows for a wide variety of parties to be represented.

- minority opinions within minority population (e.g. whites and Coloureds, and others too) can be represented.

- MPs are not . .more elected by the electorate, even on a party list, but chosen by parties which is an eminently corruptible process.

Both a constituency system and a PR system (or MMP) make little difference to the fact that it's opposition parties who need to step up their game, or wait until the ANC fragments.

It is puzzling that we cannot see the ANC's hegemony derives from the party enjoying a majority among voters, not upon the mechanism of voting. Until that basic condition changes, tinkering with the electoral system might well produce worse results for . .more the opposition and fewer seats. There is no way of knowing in advance.

That is the reason the DA do not campaign on the issue. The DA leave the matter to a private member's bill - tokenism that plainly has no chance.

In the new democratic SA, the party list system allowed the ANC to control the choice of candidates and that brought early stability where the tendency would otherwise have been towards a multiplicity of parties and a chaotic parliament and, worse, executive.

This system, beneficial initially, is now showing its downside as the electorate becomes slowly more sophisticated and selective.

I  entirely agree with the criticisms of the current parliament. Supposedly the supreme body in the land in theory, but in reality only as the mouthpiece and blind servant of anonymous individuals in Luthuli house. And full of predominantly fat and . .more complacent functionaries. many of whom are asleep in the benches. The reality open to view by all South Africans can only breed contempt for the institution and for parliamentary democracy as a whole.

âDie einde van Lindiwe Mazibuko en die onenigheid in die DA kom nie van gister af nie. Pieter du Toit skryf oor die aanloop daarvan.

Mnr. Athol Trollip en me. Lindiwe Mazibuko het teen . .more mekaar gestaan vir die pos van leier van die opposisie in die parlement. Lindiwe het die stryd maklik gewen. Foto: Yunus Mohamed.

Toe Athol Trollip, destyds nuut op die nasionale politieke verhoog, die oggend van 7 Mei 2009 uit die Helen Suzman-koukuskamer in die Marksgebou by die parlement uitstap, het die gesigte geval.

Die nuwe parlementÃªre leier was â soos tradisie bepaal â die eerste een wat nÃ¡ die koukusverkiesing by die deur verskyn het. DA-amptenare, meelopers en enkele joernaliste kon nie glo diÃ© boer van die Oos-Kaap het Ryan Coetzee, die party se wonderkind en meesterstrateeg, om die parlementÃªre leierskap getroef nie.

Voor die tyd is gesÃª Coetzee â die brein agter die party se groei en sy voorste intellektueel â hoef omtrent net op te daag om te wen. Sy ondersteuners het gesukkel om die neerlaag van 33 stemme teenoor 46 te verwerk, in so ân mate dat ân Coetzee-agent â ân steeds aktiewe parlementÃªre joernalis â glo dieselfde dag by Trollip se kantoor ingebars en hom beloof het hy sal seker maak Trollip hou nie lank nie.

Net ân bietjie meer as twee jaar later â op 28 Oktober 2011 â het Mazibuko die middeltermyn-leiersverkiesing in die parlement gewen deur Trollip met 50-33 te klop.

Mazibuko se oorwinning het bekend gestaan as âRyanâs revengeâ. Dit het egter nie lank gehou nie.

Mazibuko â sjarmant en wel ter tale â se verheffing tot leier van die opposisie was teen die tweede helfte van 2011 nie ân verrassing nie. Daar was toe al meer as ân jaar lank ân aktiewe veldtog in die koukus aan die gang om hom te vervang, terwyl Mazibuko se prominensie toenemend deur die partyleierskorps bevorder is.

Trollip â betroubaar sonder om skouspelagtig te wees â is toenemend verdag gemaak as oud, wit en ondoeltreffend. Sy kommunikasie na buite is deur Gareth van Onselen, toe om die beurt die party se beleids- en kommunikasiehoof, goedgekeur, terwyl Coetzee â wat die koukus vir ân pos in die provinsiale regering verlaat en in die wandelgange as Zille se âpolitieke kommissarâ bekend gestaan het â glo toenemend ingemeng het.

Mazibuko is nÃ¡ die 2009-verkiesing tot parlementslid verkies en het enkele maande onder Niekie van den Berg in die portefeuljekomitee oor kommunikasie gedien voordat sy na die komitee oor landelike ontwikkeling en grondhervorming geskuif is. Sy was nie in een van die komitees (waar die wetgewende skouer aan die wiel gelÃª word) ân konstante teenwoordigheid nie, maar is saam met LPâs soos David Maynier en Tim Harris voorgehou as die toekoms waarop die party gebou moet word.

In die kommunikasiekomitee was sy egter deurentyd laat vir vergaderings en sy en haar bankmaat kon dikwels nie oor standpunte ooreenkom nie. Syâs ook bo Annette Steyn as woordvoerder oor grondsake aangewys en verklarings oor die destydse omstrede groenskrif oor grondhervorming is onder haar naam uitgereik, hoewel sy omtrent nooit komiteevergaderings bygewoon het nie.

âLindiwe was die produk van ân beplande bemarkingsveldtogâ.â.â.âwaar het jou nou al ooit gesien dat ân kandidaat vir ân interne verkiesing beeldpoetsers van buite aanstel, soos sy in 2011 gedoen het?â sÃª ân DA-veteraan.

Dis uit onderhoude met talle DA-LPâs, voormalige LPâs en dienende leiersfigure â ondersteuners Ã©n opponente van Mazibuko â duidelik haar doodloopstraat in die party is nie die gevolg van ân diepgaande ideologiese verskil met Helen Zille, die partyÂ­leierskorps, die ou of die nuwe garde nie. Dis ân geval van iemand wat aan die diep kant ingegooi is en die slagoffer geword het van magstryde in ân groeiende en toenemend komplekse politieke party.

Die parlement is ân wonderlike plek om in te werk vir politici, maar dis nie die regte wÃªreld nie.

of ontevredenheid met Mazibuko se leierskap nie totdat stories einde verlede jaar oor die bakleiery oor regstel-wetgewing rugbaar geword het. Enersyds omdat daar lede van die parlementÃªre persgalery is wat deel van faksies en die politieke proses geword het (en sulke berigte dus onderdruk het) en andersyds omdat soveel mense wou gehad het Mazibuko moet slaag.

Mazibuko â en haar koukusleierskorps van Wilmot James (koukusvoorsitter) en Watty Watson (hoofsweep) â se swak hantering van die omstrede regstel-wetgewing word voorgehou as die druppel wat die emmer laat oorloop het.

Mazibuko was ook nie ontvanklik vir raad en leiding nie. Trollip het glo (ânadat hy sy wonde gelek en herstel het,â volgens ân LP) aangebied om Mazibuko met raad oor prosesse en prosedures te bedien. Sy het dit egter van die hand gewys.

ân Lid van die party se federale uitvoerende raad â en ook ân leiersfiguur in die koukus â wat vir Mazibuko gestem het, sÃª dit is nie so dat Zille onbehoorlik in die koukus ingemeng het nie, soos nou beweer word. âInteendeel, dis Mazibuko wat haar van die nasionale leierskorps afgesluit het. Daar was geen ruimte vir inspraak van buite nie,â meen diÃ© LP.

Nog ân LP â wat nou herkies is en teen Mazibuko gestem het â sÃª Mazibuko het sigbaar gesukkel met bestuur. Sy was soggens glo gereeld laat (âsy het soms eers 09:30 op kantoor gekomâ) en was dikwels nie voldoende voorberei wanneer vergaderings gehou is nie.

Mazibuko se verkiesing is intern voorgehou as een wat die DA aanvaarbaarder vir die swart kieserskorps sou maak. Die DA het aantygings â van binne en buite â dat Mazibuko in geparachute is, verwerp. Nou blyk dit die algemene gevoel is dat dit wel so was.

âKyk, sy wÃ¡s goed wanneer sy in die Nasionale Vergadering gepraat het; sy het (pres. Jacob) Zuma op sy tone gehou, op Nkandla gefokus en die regte knoppies gedruk,â sÃª ân LP wat Mazibuko nie goedgesind is nie.

âEk is nie sonder simpatie vir Lindiwe nie,â sÃª die voormalige senior LP.

Die DA beleef nou wat die ANC al jare ervaar: faksiegevegte, verdagmaking en die najaag van mag, gedryf deur persoonlike ambisie en interne en eksterne rolspelers. Die media, soos in die aanloop tot die ANC se Polokwane-konferensie in 2007, speel hierin ook ân rol.

You make some interesting points. The electoral system would have made little difference even before 1994 for the same reasons, that the NP was the party with a firm lock on the largest section of the white population.

Interesting read. Did you write it yourself or did you lift it from somewhere else. Just curious. And then I would very much like to know how you naged to get such a long contribution past the 1350 character deadline. Again, just curious.

Not . .more being a DA supporter the doings and the scr@wings of the DA does not really upset me. In addition, I am not surprised at anything politicians get up to. The Germans have a saying: It is better for the little man (man in the street) not to know two things: One - how they make sausages and two, how they make laws. Politicians are at the heart of the law making process - a very messy business.

Never trust a libtard.

I am sure Jon is a very good speech writer for the premier,

but not sure that he has though his speech through.

How many members of parliament does he propose and how many voters per mp.

With STV, there is only one kind of MP, unlike with mixed list systems.

STV is constituency based and  MPs have direct personal accountability to voters.  As each constituency has a number of MPs (say, 5), of different parties, most voters can . .more relate to at least one of them.

STV maximizes voters' choices and provides proportional representation not only of parties but also of any other groupings that matter to voters.

Unlike list systems, STV encourages "broad church" parties and discourages splintering.

STV is a unifying system that helps to reconcile different religious, cultural and ethnic groupings.  That is why successive Labour and Conservative UK Governments have introduced and maintained the system in Northern Ireland despite refusing to introduce it elsewhere in the UK.

I an sure you would agree STV would be far too sophisticated for a new democracy finding its feet. It illustrates again the point that voting systems must be tailored to political realities, not made the hope of changing them.

My longer and more detailed comment is curiously missing but I do not agree with Paul Whelan that STV is too sophisticated for a new democracy.

Paul - I infer from your comment that you agree that STV is better than mixed list systems and your . .more only reservation is whether South African voters could cope with it.   Surely you are not suggesting that South African voters are not intelligent enough to list candidates in order of choice?  Many probably already vote like that for other purposes; for example to decide the best photo, prettiest  garden or smartest dress.

With STV, it is the counting, not the voting, that is sophisticated and even the counting is based on a very simple principle.

STV would, in my view, be very inappropriate for any new democracy that has to learn through experience about running things and developing the people, resources and dependable institutions to do so. In 1994 priorities were very clear and not about . .more addressing niceties of representation; no doubt such debates seemed very marginal, if not irrelevant then.

Progress so far shows that the system set up has served the country well during a period when SA's voters have been clear about their loyalties and the government they wish to have. The present electoral system delivered it while laying a foundation of stability absolutely vital for the future.
