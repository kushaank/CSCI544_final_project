
Bangkok: Thailand's acting prime minister has met with a group of senators to seek a solution to the country's ongoing political crisis, as anti-government protesters continue to pressure the Cabinet to resign.

A participant said Niwattumrong Boonsongpaisan's government indicated today it is willing to cooperate with the Senate but refused to step down because that might violate the constitution.

The senators sought the meeting after saying on Friday that a government with full authority should conduct political reforms, but stopping short of directly calling the Cabinet to resign.

The Cabinet has operated in a caretaker capacity with limited power since the lower house was dissolved in December. Anti-government protesters say they are making their final push to oust the government after six months of street demonstrations in which 28 people have died.
