On May 18 Crimean Tatars mark the 70th anniversary of deportation. However, Russia has forbidden to commemorate this event in the occupied Crimea area. On that day, following Joseph Stalin's order, more than 230,000 Tatars (mostly women and children) were deported from Crimea to Central Asia and Siberia.
