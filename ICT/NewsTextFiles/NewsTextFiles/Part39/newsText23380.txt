For years, Pennsylvania has suffered from a lack of doctors, especially in its rural communities.  Today, 17 Pennsylvania counties either face or anticipate doctor shortages. And with one of the largest elderly populations in the nation, our need for doctors will only continue to grow.

If successful, this effort will intensify our state's doctor shortage and compromise care for seniors.

Under this program, doctors directly purchase drugs and are then reimbursed according to a formula combining that drug's average sales price, plus an additional six percent that helps to cover the costs of storing and administering the drug.

Now, lawmakers are considering cutting Part B drug payment even further.

Medicare Part B patients are left driving longer to see doctors, sitting on wait lists, and, in some cases, forgoing care completely.

Almost 12 percent of Pennsylvanians live in rural counties, but just 7 percent of the state's physicians practice in these areas.

Congress faces hard choices when it comes to controlling spending.  But cutting Part B drug reimbursement to the point that it is financially untenable for doctors to see their patients is no way to save money.

Unable to visit a local community clinic or physician's office, seniors will have to rely on hospitals, where care is typically much more expensive.

As the health needs of Pennsylvania grow, it's imperative that we preserve their access to care and keep local clinics financially viable.  Further cuts to Medicare Part B drugs must be rejected.
