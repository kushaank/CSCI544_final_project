
U.S. Congressman Mike McIntyre announced that Congress will authorize an extension of the Carolina Beach renourishment project through the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014.

The fifty-year Carolina Beach renourishment project was set to expire this year, with no method for extension. The WRRDA bill authorizes a three-year extension of coastal storm damage projects which are scheduled to expire in the next five years, including Carolina Beach. In addition, it creates a process by which successful projects can be extended by up to 15 years with the help of federal funds.

Congressman recently announced that an additional $2.7 million in Congressionally appropriated funds will be available for Carolina Beach to complete this yearâ€™s beach nourishment. He introduced legislation known as the BEACH Act, to renew this project during the last two sessions of Congress and has made the Carolina Beach nourishment reauthorization one of his top priorities.
