Two Saskatoon police officers simultaneously used Tasers in an attempt to stop a 26-year-old man from harming himself.

Officers responded Saturday around 9:30 p.m. after a report of an injured person in the 300 block of Montreal Avenue South. They encountered a man kneeling in the street âwith a large knife clutched between his hands,â police said in a news release.

Police say as the officers attempted to deescalate the situation, the man raised his hands and made âa plunging motionâ towards himself with the knife. Tasers were used simultaneously by two officers to prevent the man from hurting himself.

The man was taken by ambulance to Saskatoon hospital, where he was treated and then released into police custody. He is facing several assault and weapons charges.

According to Saskatoon Police Service policy, a use-of-force report will be submitted for an internal review.
