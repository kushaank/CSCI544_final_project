
A blanket manufactured to commemorate Pope John Paul’s visit to Lesotho about 24 years ago is on display in an art museum in Bloemfontein.

The Oliewenhuis Art Museum is exhibiting a large range of Basotho blankets and will have the collection up until June 16. The exhibition is unique in that the time span in which the blankets were collected and occurrences of some of the blankets.

The collection includes a Sandringham mountain rug or Mohodu dating back to 1934, a Badge of the Brave blanket honouring those who fought during World War II (1939-1945) and a Batho ba Roma blanket made to commemorate Pope John Paul’s visit to Lesotho in 1988.

Certainly the most prestigious blanket in the collection is Seanamarena or “chief’s blanket”. Exhibition officer Karen Marais said the blanket culture in Lesotho dated as far back as 1823 when a blanket was presented to Moshoeshoe I by a French missionary.

Legend has it that these lines originally resulted from a manufacturing error but went on to become an intrinsic trait of the Basotho blankets.
