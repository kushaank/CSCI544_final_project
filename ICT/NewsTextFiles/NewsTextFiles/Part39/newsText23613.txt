Indian authorities are now expected to seek access to an official interrogation report prepared by Malaysian authorities, which includes Hussain's statement that he had been asked to arrange travel documents and hideouts for two men sent by Pakistan's spy agency, Inter-Services Intelligence, from Maldives in the Indian Ocean to India's east coast city of Chennai, PTI reported, citing Bakri Zinin, Deputy Inspector-General of Malaysia. Hussain, known to be involved in human trafficking, forging passports and smuggling fake Indian currency, was arrested on April 29 in a coordinated operation by Sri Lankan and Malaysian officials.
