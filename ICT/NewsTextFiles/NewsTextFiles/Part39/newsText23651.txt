
Russian President Vladimir Putin has pledged to defend ethnic Russians wherever they live. He has subsequently embarked on an aggressive drive to rebuild Russian pride and assertiveness, which he says was lost in the collapse of the Soviet Union.

One week ahead of the presidential election in Ukraine that should help determine the county’s future relationship with Russia, Putin has been seeking to redress what he has called the historical tragedy – that shattered the Soviet empire into 15 separate nations.

From taking control of Crimea to gathering separatist petitions in Moldova, to handing out passports to comrades in the Baltics, Putin has been focused during recent weeks on neighboring republics, many of which have larege ethnic Russian minorities.
