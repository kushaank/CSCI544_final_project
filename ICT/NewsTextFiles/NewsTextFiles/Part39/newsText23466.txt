
The JD (U) legislature party has decided to take the final call on choosing a new leader today in the wake of the resignation of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.

Party MLAs yesterday unanimously chose Nitish Kumar as their leader and insisted that he withdraw his resignation, but Nitish refused. He sought a day's time to decide on the matter.

After the meeting here, JD(U) General Secretary Anjani Kumar said that party's MLA want Nitish to continue as the Chief Minister.

Nitish had stepped down from the top post on Saturday after taking moral responsibility for the party's debacle in the Lok Sabha elections.

Kumar has not recommended dissolution of the assembly, this leaving a window for formation of a new government, if any other party cobbles up majority in the 243-member house.

The JD-U won only two parliamentary seats out of 40 in Bihar while Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) cornered 31 seats. Modi's BJP won 282 seats, 10 more than the majority required to rule.

With its allied parties, in the recently concluded general elections paving for a comfortable tally of around 337 - the clearest result since the 1984 assassination of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi propelled her son Rajiv to office.
