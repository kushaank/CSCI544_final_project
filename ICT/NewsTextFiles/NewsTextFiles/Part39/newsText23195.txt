
New Delhi :Â Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul today offered to resign over the party's colossal electoral defeat, but the party's top leaders rejected it unanimously.

As the meeting began, a group of youth Congress workers outside the venue shouted pro-Rahul slogans.

While accepting responsibility on Friday for what he described as the Congress doing "pretty badly", Mr Gandhi's smile baffled many .

The role of his key advisers including Jairam Ramesh may be faulted at the CWC meeting.
