BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) - Officials are trying to boost the number of dairy farms in North Dakota.

Members of the North Dakota Dairy Coalition recently met with representatives of crop commodity groups. State Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring says rebuilding the stateâ€™s dairy industry will give crop and forage producers more local markets. He says it also will ensure that North Dakota is not dependent on outside sources for its milk supply.

The number of dairy farms in North Dakota has fallen below 100.
