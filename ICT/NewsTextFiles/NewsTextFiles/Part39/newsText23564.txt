
Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders says a bill passed by a Senate panel would bring nearly $1.3 billion to repair the state's roads and bridges.

The Senate public works committee passed the $265 billion transportation funding bill Thursday.

Sanders says the bill - if approved by the full Senate - would see Vermont getting the $1.25 billion in funds between 2015 and 2020.

The bill includes a Sanders amendment that would make Vermont eligible to apply for additional funding through a new program to support projects of regional or national significance.

He says the measure would not only help repair the nation's crumbling infrastructure, but could also create nearly 2 million jobs nationwide.
