The primary sponsor of a bill that would allow same-sex couples to enter into civil unions in Peru has come out as gay. "Yes, I am gay and I am proud to belong to this group of people who are so valuable to Peru," said Congressman Carlos Bruce during an interview the Peruvian newspaper El Comercio published on Sunday. Bruce -- a member of the centrist Possible Peru Alliance who represents Lima, the Peruvian capital -- told the newspaper his two sons support his decision to come out. The congressman also reiterated his criticisms of Lima Archbishop Juan Luis Cipriani who opposes the civil unions bill.
