
NEW DELHI: A party needs to have at least 55 members in the Lok Sabha to be recognized as one within the House. Since the Congress party got less than the stipulated number, it is liable to be demoted from a "recognized party" to a "recognized group".

The Congress faces this ignominy thanks to a1998 law distinguishing a recognized party from a distinguished group for the purpose of providing different levels of facilities to the two categories. Section 2 of "the leaders and chief whips of recognized parties and groups in Parliament (facilities) Act, 1998" specifies that the cutoff for Lok Sabha is 55 members and Rajya Sabha is 25, each of which is about 10% of the total strength of the respective House.

The 1998 law may also put a question mark on whether Congress, with a tally of 44 members in the Lok Sabha, is legally entitled to claim the office of the Leader of the Opposition (LOP).

Though the designation was formally conferred for the first time in 1969 on the leader of a Congress breakaway, it took another eight years for the office of LOP to attain a statutory status. This followed the passage of "the salary and allowances of leaders of opposition in Parliament Act, 1977".

Section 2 of the 1977 Act defines the LOP of each House as "the leader in that House of the party in opposition to the Government having the greatest numerical strength". Besides, the 1977 law enters the caveat that the Opposition party in question will have to be "recognized as such" by the presiding officer of the House.

In the pre-1998 scenario, the tally of 44 seats would not have disqualified Congress from bagging the LOP post as, under the 1977 law, the Speaker would have had no choice but to recognize it as the party with the greatest numerical strength in the Opposition.

But the 1998 law has thrown a spanner in the works for the Congress party. This is because of the introduction of the minimum strength of 55 members for it to be a "recognized party". In the circumstances, it may be anomalous for the Congress leader to be designated as the LOP under the 1977 law overriding the condition imposed by the 1998 law. This is despite a proviso in the 1998 law that no facilities could be provided under it to any leader who holds the office of the LOP under the 1977 law.

The adversity faced by the Congress party will not however yield an opportunity to parties with lesser strength to wangle the LOP post, which enjoys the status of a Cabinet minister. This is because both the 1977 and 1998 laws recognize only parties, not alliances, whether pre or post election. Hence, there is little likelihood of the Trinamool Congress succeeding in its reported move to claim the LOP post on the basis of a possible tie-up with AIADMK.

Despite the decimation of the Congress party, there is one legal compulsion for its leader to be nominated as the LOP. It is the trend in the last two decades of laws providing the inclusion of the LOP in the selection committee for the appointment of various statutory authorities: NHRC, CVC, CIC and Lokpal.
