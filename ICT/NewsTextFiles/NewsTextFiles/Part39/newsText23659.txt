
The Council today decided to repeal its decision under Art. 96 of the Cotonou agreement on Madagascar, which had been in force since 2010. This means the full resumption of EU development cooperation with this country.

This decision comes in the wake of the presidential and general elections held in Madagascar in 2013, an important phase in the return to constitutional order and a point of departure for the consolidation of democracy, rule of law, good governance and political stabilisation. Both elections were monitored by an EU election observation mission and judged credible.

The EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, said: "I welcome this decision, which opens the door to a new era of cooperation with Madagascar."

European Commissioner for Development, Andris Piebalgs, added: "Today's decision shows the EU is determined to support Madagascar in its path to prosperity and stability and to help lifting the most vulnerable people in the country, who are in dire need of assistance, out of poverty. I look forward to visiting the country in June and get the programming works started."

EU development cooperation with Madagascar had been formally suspended since June 2010 when the Council imposed appropriate measures in the wake of the forcible transfer of power in Madagascar on 17 March 2009, which the EU considered a flagrant violation of democracy and the rule of law. Humanitarian aid and direct support to the population were not touched by the freeze of cooperation.

Programming for EU development assistance to Madagascar under the 11th European Development Fund for the years 2014 to 2020 will be launched shortly.
