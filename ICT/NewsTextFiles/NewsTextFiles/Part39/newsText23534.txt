
The Texas Tech University System Board of Regents officially named state Sen. Robert Duncan , R-Lubbock, the sole finalist to be the system’s next chancellor in a news release issued Monday afternoon.

Duncan is expected to start in his new position July 1. A special election will have to be held to replace him, and at least one candidate — state Rep. Charles Perry , R-Lubbock — has already announced an intention to run.

Duncan has served in the Texas Senate since 1997. He served in the Texas House from 1993 to 1997.

Mickey Long, chairman of the Texas Tech board, expressed delight that, though the regents undertook a national search for the replacement for outgoing Chancellor Kent Hance, they ended up with a new chancellor with strong personal ties to the region and to Tech.

State Rep. Drew Darby , R-San Angelo, whose district includes Angelo State University, which is part of the Tech System, was quick to offer his congratulations.
