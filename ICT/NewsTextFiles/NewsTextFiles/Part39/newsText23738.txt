
STAVANGER, Norway – A majority in the Norwegian Energy and Environmental Committee has presented a proposal to the Storting involving the supply of power from land to the entire Utsira Height.

Power from land to all of Utsira is one of three options in the concept study for the Johan Sverdrup oil field in the North Sea .

The committee spokesman, who represents the Labor Party, said that it is important for Statoil that the scheduled progress in developing the Sverdrup field is maintained. One year’s delay on Sverdrup will entail a pre-tax loss, in present value, of NOK 20 billion kroner ($3.4 billion).

Together with its partners, Statoil will consider whether the consequences of this proposal could lead to delay. It is unclear how the requirement to lay cables between the installations from the Sverdrup startup phase will impact on the concept chosen and the project’s progress.
