
Monica Wehby, the leading GOP Senate candidate in Oregon, was accused in December 2007 of harassing her now ex-husband during a divorce proceeding, according to a new report.

Neither Wehby nor her ex-husband, James Grant, were arrested in the incident.

It marks the second time during the last three days that Wehby has faced embarrassing stories on her personal life. POLITICO reported on Friday that a former boyfriend had accused Wehby of “stalking” him last year and “harassing” his employees, although no charges were filed in that episode, either.

The Oregonian reported on Monday that Portland police responded to a domestic disturbance call on Dec. 16, 2007, at the home Wehby shared with Grant, her then-husband, and their four children.

According to the police report , Wehby — who had “some alcoholic beverages” that evening — had allegedly struck Grant with a pad of paper during a verbal dispute.

The police officers observed “a slight red dot” on Grant’s face.

Grant told the police that Wehby “has pulled his hair, slapped him, and thrown items at item” during the last year as the couple’s marriage deteriorated.

Wehby denied striking Grant during the altercation.

Grant also admitted to police officers that he had “been violent with [Wehby] in the past [approximately] 3 years or so ago,” the report states.

Neither Wehby nor Grant wanted to have the other arrested, and they sought to avoid the filing of a police report. The officers told the couple to sleep in separate rooms, and Wehby and Grant were warned they could be detained on domestic violence charges.
