
The Environmental Protection Agency last week announced that it was fining publicly traded Clean Harbors LLC of Norwell, Massachusetts, $581,236 for several violations discovered at a facility in El Dorado.

Clean Harbors improperly identified, stored and disposed of hazardous waste and failed to comply with air emission standards, according to a news release from the EPA.

The facility treats waste, both hazardous and nonhazardous, by way of high-temperature incineration. Some of the hazardous waste, which should have been disposed of, was instead being resold. Clean Harbors is no longer selling that waste and it is now being properly disposed of, the EPA said.

In order to comply with emission standards, Clean Harbors also committed to a $750,000 overhaul of some of its facility, routing emissions from hazardous waste storage tanks to a secondary combustion chamber.

The EPA discovered the companyâ€™s violations as part of multiple Resource Conversation & Recovery Act inspections carried out in 2009 and 2011.

A spokesman for Clean Harbors did not respond to requests for comment by press time.
