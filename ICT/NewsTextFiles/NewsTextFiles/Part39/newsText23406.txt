
Fairbanks, AK - Alaska’s marijuana ballot initiative has some Fairbanks entrepreneurs organizing in hope of being able to grow and sell the drug. Proposition 2 would have the state regulate marijuana like alcohol.  Fairbanks resident Brandon Emmett is Executive Director of the recently formed  Coalition for Responsible Cannabis Legislation.

"There are certain provisions of the bill that state persons over 21 can use, they can obtain a certain amount of plants in their home, but all of the time, place and manner of different establishments, what the advertisements can be, how these establishments can be run, none of that is really set yet, so our coalition is really the next step," he said.

"My business is gonna be called Mystiek’s Marijuana Dispensary, Nursery and Supply.  I thought it would be really fun to open up a little section of it and have a smokers club, similar to cigar clubs," she said.
