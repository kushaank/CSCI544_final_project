
Gunshots fired at around 6:20 p.m. this evening left two people dead and two others injured in an altercation involving at least five people, WSB Atlanta reports.

According to Cobb County police , residents in a neighborhood along Cardell Road and Timothy Lane tried to help one man as he begged for help after being shot. Witness Julia Biddy said she came across the man, lying on the ground, in desperate need of help.

"He was in pretty bad shape. ’Can you please help me?’ I run towards him, ‘Put pressure, put pressure.’ ‘I'm putting pressure as hard as I can,’” Biddy told police.

A male allegedly shot the victims while on top of a carport located at one of he houses in the neighborhood.

"The guy was on the car port of the house shooting at him,” said Biddy.

Another male driving a gray Hyundai pulled up shortly after, demanding a black bag from the injured man. The driver stated that man who lay shot on the ground was his partner, but witnesses state that he seemed more concerned about getting the black bag than saving his friend. After he retrieved the bag, he left, taking the injured man with him.

A man wearing a grey hooded sweatshirt was seen running from the scene shortly after, but authorities haven't determined if he is a victim or a suspect in the altercation.

Cobb police confirmed that two people were killed during the altercation and another two injured. They are still trying to piece together exactly what happened. The names of the victims are disclosed at this time.
