May 19, Colombo: A Sri Lankan court warned the police today not to appeal for injunctions against peaceful protests.

Colombo Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya issued a warning to the Deputy Inspector General Anura Senanayake saying that the court will not issue any injunction orders against peaceful protests in future.

The Magistrate made this comment when the police produced 17 students of the Allied Health Sciences Degree Program arrested for violating court orders and protesting.

The students were released on two personal bails amounting to Rs. 100,000 each.

The judge also told the police if they want to stop university students' protests, they should serve the summons to the respective parties at least one week before the event and the court will summon both parties before it issues an injunction.

The police officer requested the court to allow protests only at the places stipulated by police. However, the lawyers appearing for the suspects protested it. They argued that police had no right for such request. The court rejected the police request.

The case will be heard again on June 26.

Meanwhile, 13 students arrested by the Slave Island police for violating court orders and protesting were also released by the Colombo Chief Magistrate Thilina Gamage today on two sureties of Rs.100,000 each.

Four of the students were not in court today as they were receiving treatment at the Colombo National Hospital for the injuries they suffer when the police used "minimum force" to disperse the protesters.

The Magistrate said the minimum force should not pop the eyes out of the protesters and warned the police to be more responsible and restrained when handling protests involving students.
