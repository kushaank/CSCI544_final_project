
It may be justified for Sri Lanka to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the defeat of the Tamil Tigers, but the glorification of Sri Lanka’s military at the expense of reconciliation between all Sri Lankans, regardless of their ethnic background, is very wrong. It is part of President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s efforts to gather power into the hands of his family and close allies and build a profoundly autocratic government in what should be a democracy.

The government is stuck in its wartime language and has refused to work for serious reconciliation. Instead, it needs to work with the Tamils — many of whom hated what the Tigers were doing. Rajapaksa must recognise that he is president of a nation that includes Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims — many of whom gave their lives to defeat the Tamil Tigers.
