
CISCO CHAIRMAN AND CEO John Chambers has sent a letter to US President Obama and told him to keep his spies out of Cisco kit and leave its network equipment business alone.

While the NSA chose not to be drawn into discussions about this, Cisco has both published a shocked blog and sent a letter in objection, which was seen the Financial Times.

The blog post, which came first, accused the Obama administration of overreach .

"It is in this context that I want to offer some thoughts on actions by the US government that in Cisco's eyes have overreached, undermining the goals of free communication, and steps that can be taken to right that balance, and I do so on behalf of all of Cisco's leadership team."

The same thoughts are echoed in the missive from Chambers, addressed to US President Obama.

"If these allegations are true, these actions will undermine confidence in our industry and the ability of technology companies to deliver products globally," he said.

"Confidence in the open, global internet has brought enormous economic benefits to the United States and to billions of people around the world. This confidence is being eroded by revelations of governments' surveillance."

"We simply cannot operate this way, our customers trust us to be able to deliver to their doorsteps products that meet the highest standards of integrity and security. That is why we need new standards of conduct, or a new set of 'rules of the road', to ensure that appropriate safeguards and limits exist that serve national security objectives, while at the same time meet the needs of global commerce," he added.
