
Chambers urged Obama to create new rules of conduct.

New York - Cisco chief executive John Chambers has complained to US President Barack Obama about the National Security Agency's spying practices, saying they were harming overseas business for US tech firms.

“This issue affects an entire industry,” the head of the telecom  equipment maker said in a letter  obtained by AFP.

Chambers referred in particular to recent media reports that the  NSA had intercepted and modified IT and telecom equipment on its way from manufacturers to customers.

One of the manufacturers was Cisco, which is a top supplier of networking equipment.

“If these allegations are true, these actions will undermine confidence in our industry and in the ability of technology companies to deliver products globally,” Chambers warned.

“We simply cannot operate this way.

Without such rules, “we are concerned that our country's global technological leadership will be impaired,” Chambers said.

A Cisco spokesman confirmed that Chambers had written to Obama but declined to comment on the content of the letter.

“We comply with US laws, like those of many other countries, which limit exports to certain customers and destinations,” Chandler said.

Several players in the US tech sector have already registered complaints following revelations of the NSA's vast online surveillance program.
