
GEORGE TOWN, May 19 — Barisan Nasional state assemblyman Datuk Roslan Saidin (BN-Pinang Tunggal), has demanded that the Rights and Privilege Committee’s findings on his remarks about ethnic Chinese doctors refusing to treat Malay patients be tabled during the current state assembly sitting.

Roslan was referred to the committee for his remarks to the assembly in July, saying that he had received complaints from patients that three ethnic Chinese doctors, two from the Kepala Batas Hospital and one from the Seberang Jaya Hospital, had refused to treat Malay patients.

“My reputation as a state assemblyman is at stake so we want to know the findings of the committee since it has already met and come to a conclusion,” he said.

Penang state legislative assembly Speaker Law Choo Kiang explained that he had yet to scrutinise the documentations of the findings by the committee.

“This is a serious issue so I need to go through the documents closely before it can be tabled, so the findings will only be tabled at the next sitting,” he said.

Several other BN state assemblymen including state Opposition leader Datuk Jahara Hamid backed Roslan as the next sitting is six months away.

Later, outside the hall today, Jahara told a press conference that since a decision has been made, then it should be tabled at the assembly.

“The findings is already made so we find it suspicious that it wasn’t tabled now but has to be tabled in the next sitting,” she said.

Jahara and Roslan demanded to know where the transparency and accountability that the Pakatan Rakyat-led state government had always spouted is.

They believed there is “something” or “someone” behind the delay in tabling the findings of the committee.

Law had told the assembly that there was nothing behind the delay in tabling the findings and maintained that he needed more time to read through the findings.
