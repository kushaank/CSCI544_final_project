
The European Union is lifting a ban on development aid to Madagascar, imposed in 2010 after a coup on the island off the coast of East Africa, the bloc announced Monday.

The decision restores EU relations with the Indian Ocean island, where five years of political crisis have hindered the flow of much-needed foreign aid and investment.

EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, who chaired Monday's meeting of the bloc's development ministers, said the decision "opens the door to a new era of cooperation with Madagascar."

"It shows the EU is determined to support Madagascar in its path to prosperity and stability and to help lift the most vulnerable people in the country... out of poverty," added EU Development Commissioner Andris Piebalgs.

The bloc is due soon to begin assigning development funding to the country for the period until 2020, it said in a statement.

The decision comes after Madagascar held elections in January, in which Hery Rajaonarimampianina was voted in as president, to replace Andry Rajoelina.

Rajoelina had seized power in a 2009 coup that brought political and economic instability to the island.
