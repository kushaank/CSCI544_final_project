
Get ready for some possible Cameron Diaz sightings in Maryland.

Multiple outlets, including Us Weekly magazine and gossip site X17online.com, are reporting that the actress is dating Good Charlotte guitarist Benji Madden . Benji and his bandmate/brother Joel Madden, were both born and raised in Waldorf.

Representatives for both Diaz, 41, and Madden, 35, did not comment on the report. "A source" told Us : "It's very new" and they're "just hanging out."

Madden has been previously linked to Paris Hilton (so this is a bit of an upgrade, if true). Diaz's last high-profile relationship was with New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez.

The couple apparently met through Joel Madden's wife, Nicole Richie , who is friends with Diaz.

"Nicole thought they'd click," the source added.
