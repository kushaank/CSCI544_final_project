
THE Cape Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which has recently been reconstituted as nonprofit company, has appointed Ruben Richards as its first CE.

The Western Cape’s economy is South Africa’s second-largest after Gauteng’s, and the province holds key sea ports at Cape Town and Saldanha. Gauteng produces approximately a third of South Africa’s gross domestic product.

Dr Richards, a former deputy director-general of the Scorpions — the elite police and prosecuting unit that preceded the police-only Hawks, has qualifications in engineering, sociology and theology.

He served as an apprenticeship as a fitter and turner and went on to become CEO of marine repair and conversion company Globe Engineering.

Dr Richards also had extensive experience in top-level management and academia, and had been a consultant to the United Nations, the chamber said.

The chamber provides its members in business with information, training, business opportunities and representation. President Janine Myburgh said the chamber was "extremely fortunate to have a man of Dr Richards’ talent, energy and experience as its new leader".

"Not only does Dr Richards bring an extensive new network into the fold, but his background and diverse experience in the business, academic, government and civil society spheres gives him a unique perspective on the challenges of our people. It also allows him a holistic view of possible solutions, which is precisely what is needed right now," Ms Myburgh said on Monday.

"If business wants to have a say in the future of this economy and country, we must stand together and be heard. The Cape Chamber of Commerce has represented business in this region for more than 200 years, and with a leader like Dr Richards at the helm, we are best positioned to champion the cause of our members," Ms Myburgh said.

Dr Richards said he was excited by the challenge awaiting him at the chamber.

"I have chosen sides. The side that I have chosen is the side that creates wealth in the economy and which will lead to meaningful social change," Dr Richards said. He also supports, and does work for, several charities.
