
Former Sen. Jim Webb (D-Va.) on Monday suggested he’s open to running for president.

"Well, if you look at how I ran for the Senate, I announced nine months to the day before the election, with no money and no campaign staff. It takes me a while to decide things. And I'm not going to say one way or the other, really."

The former senator expressed concern about the U.S. not having a concrete national security policy abroad.

Vice president “wouldn’t be a good fit,” however, Webb added.
