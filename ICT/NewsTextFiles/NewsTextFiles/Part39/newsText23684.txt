
The Maldives Journalists Association (MJA) has announced that it will be holding its executive committee elections on June 2.

The association has attempted to hold the elections on two previous instances, with each attempt halted due to disagreements on procedural matters between its members.

MJA President Ahmed Zahir said that he is hopeful that the election can be successfully held this time.

“Our intention has always been to hold a successful election. Even on the previous two tries, we tried to complete it. However, some of our members had various reservations. We have tried to address them this time around, and so are hopeful that it can be successfully concluded,” he said.
