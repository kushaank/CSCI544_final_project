AT&T’s $48.5 billion agreement to merge with DirecTV , while hailed by the telco giant’s CEO Randall Stephenson as “something very special,” was born years ago out of several clear missteps by the executive.

In 2008, one year after Stephenson became its CEO, AT&T was unable to outbid Verizon at highly anticipated government spectrum auctions.

That same year, when rival Alltel and its valuable spectrum went on the block — spectrum that was a perfect fit for AT&T — Stephenson was again outbid by Verizon.

In the third misstep, Stephenson had AT&T in 2010 so wrapped up in an ultimately unsuccessful bid for T-Mobile that, sources said, it failed to focus on a spectrum sale by Comcast.

Again, Verizon beat AT&T to the punch.

The missed deals, in part, led to AT&T, the No. 1 wireless company in 2007 when Stephenson took over as CEO, falling far behind Verizon.

As of Dec. 31, Verizon had 96 million post-paid wireless customers, compared with AT&T’s 73 million.

Perhaps more important, AT&T in 2007 had double Verizon’s free cash flow (net cash from operations minus capital expenditures). Now, the rivals have reversed positions.

Verizon in 2013 generated $22 billion in free cash flow, compared to AT&T’s $14 billion.

Stephenson said in 2007 that video represented a once-in-a-decade opportunity to build AT&T’s next billion-dollar business. Without the spectrum, its U-Verse video has just 5.7 million customers.

AT&T declined comment.
