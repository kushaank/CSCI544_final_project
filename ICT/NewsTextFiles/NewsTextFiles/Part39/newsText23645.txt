
ALBERT LEA, Minn. -- A candidate who pledged not to force a Republican primary in Minnesota's First Congressional District has changed his mind.

Jim Hagedorn was one of three GOP candidates vying for the party's nomination last month.

State Rep. Mike Benson lost in the first round of balloting. In the second round, businessman Aaron Miller got 56 percent of the vote. That was short of the 60 percent needed for victory, but Hagedorn agreed to step aside for the sake of party unity.

All candidates agreed to abide by the vote rather than force a Republican primary in August. The winner would challenge Democratic U.S. Rep. Tim Walz this fall.

However, Hagedorn said Sunday he's re-entering the race because Miller isn't doing enough to run a full-time campaign and outwork Walz.
