
A 66-year-old woman was left shaken after a man ran up behind her and grabbed her handbag near a major netball centre in Perth’s south-east.

Police say the woman was walking along Choseley Avenue in Langford about 9am on Saturday when she heard footsteps behind her.

A male person then bumped into her and snatched the handbag, running off with it toward Langford Shopping Centre.

A spokeswoman from WA Police said the Saturday morning netball crowd at the nearby Langford Netball centre may have spotted something, and asked anyone who had seen anything suspicious to contact police.

Police are also investigating the armed robbery of a taxi driver in Kalgoorlie yesterday afternoon.

The taxi driver picked up a male passenger from the taxi rank on Hannan and Wilson Streets about 3.15pm yesterday, and took them to the railway station.

When the taxi arrived at the station, the passenger threatened the driver with a “sharp object” — believed to be a syringe — and demanded money, making off with a small amount of cash.

Anyone with information about either incident is asked to call Crimestoppers.
