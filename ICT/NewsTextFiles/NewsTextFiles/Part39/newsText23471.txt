
NCRI - Protesting students prevented Iran's former minister of culture and Islamic guidance Mohammad-Hossein Saffar-Harandi from making a speech on Sunday when he made a visit to Tabriz University.

Students waved banners, branded him a liar and chanted anti-regime slogans including 'Free Political prisoners', 'Bisij members have no place here', 'Basij is anti-people', 'Students will die but will not be humiliated, 'No to censorship', and 'The university is not a military garrison'.
