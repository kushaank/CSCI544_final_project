
Army Commander in Chief Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha on Tuesday reiterated the imposition of martial law is not a coup and people should not be concerned.

Speaking on a special televised programme, Prayuth said the military is seeking to restore order and asks political groups to halt their protests.

The centre set up under the martial law can enforce any law under the martial law act to control the situation effectively.

The martial law is imposed on Tuesday after a meeting between senators and the government on Monday failed to break the ongoing political deadlock.
