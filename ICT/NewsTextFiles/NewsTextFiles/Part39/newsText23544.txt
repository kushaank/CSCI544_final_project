
US Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) has announced he will host a town hall meeting in Wilson Saturday, May 24 as part of his Kansas Listening Tour.

Area residents are encouraged to attend and share feedback with Moran on the critical issues facing Kansas and the nation. The issues Senator Moran focuses on and the work he does in Washington, D.C., are largely based on the conversations he has with Kansans during these town hall meetings.

Throughout his time in Congress, Moran has made it a priority to stay connected to the people he represents despite a distance of more than 1,000 miles between Capitol Hill and Kansas. Since his election to the US Senate, Moran has held a town hall in each of Kansas' 105 counties. Then-Congressman Moran traveled to each of the 69 counties during his annual "Big First Listening Tour."

The event will be held this Saturday from 3 to 4 PM at the Wilson Senior Center located at 511 25th Street in Wilson.
