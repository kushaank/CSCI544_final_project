
State lawmakers have approved $500,000 in State Grant-in-Aid funding for a planned new Island Heritage Gallery exhibit at Hilos Lyman Museum.

The new, $2 million exhibit to be located in a 3,600 square foot area on the Museums second floor, will explore a historical timeline of the many people, cultures, events and ideas that left their mark on Hawai`i Island  and contributed to the rich, diverse mosaic of modern Hawai`i.

President and Executive Director Barbara Moir says the new Island Heritage Gallery is the final phase of a 15-year journey to enhance the Museums position as a world-class learning facility and treasured resource for future generations.
