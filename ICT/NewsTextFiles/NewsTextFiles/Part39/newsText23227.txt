
NEW DELHI: Sonia and Rahul Gandhi on Monday offered to quit the leadership of Congress for the staggering defeat in the elections, throwing the Congress Working Committee that met to take stock into a tizzy. Sonia Gandhi is learnt to have said four times that she wanted to resign as party president, and Rahul at least twice as vice president, but the CWC members insisted that they stay.

The resignation offers were not just pre-scripted drama during the 180-minute meeting, a CWC member insisted. In fact, persuasion of the Gandhi family to continue steering the Congress party took up most of the time with 29 of the 38 CWC members at the meeting speaking up. Not much time was left for any introspection. There might be another "chintan shiver" for that.

The next step towards correctives is likely to be the organizational reshuffle. As the much-awaited meeting got underway amid reports that leaders were seething at the direction the party has taken under Rahul, Sonia told the gathering that she had failed to strengthen the Congress and wanted to "relinquish" her position for the crushing defeat.

Barely did she stop speaking that Rahul said the party lacks the kind of accountability that is required and he wanted to start the culture of owning up by quitting his position. "I headed this campaign, it is my responsibility... I should set an example of accountability and be the first to quit," he was quoted as having told the meeting.

The hall at the AICC headquarters erupted at this, with loyalists dismissing the resignation offers out of hand. Ajit Jogi warned the party would disintegrate if the Gandhi family left, while Ghulam Nabi Azad said the meeting was called to discuss ways of rejuvenating the party and not for resignations. Anil Shastri said Congress was already a weak opposition in Parliament with just 44 MPs and Sonia's resignation would weaken it further. "India cannot afford a weak Congress," he said. Another member said Sonia's resignation would only help realize Narendra Modi's dream of a "Congress-free India".

It's not known whether the resignation drama had been scripted to fob off any attack on the leadership, the upshot of it all was that the meeting ended up tightening Sonia's grip on the party. There have been rumblings about Rahul's style of functioning, which had raised fears that it could find mention at the CWC.

In the CWC resolution blame for the debacle was shared by both the government and the party. Manmohan Singh owned up responsibility for the government's failures. The resolution asked for state Congress governments to take "corrective steps", which was being interpreted as them focusing on jobs and development.

Insiders insisted that Sonia's outburst was spontaneous which caught the leaders off guard and she had to be persuaded to take back the resignation. Asked about the sum and substance of the meeting, AICC general secretary Janardan Dwivedi said, "Accountability has been talked about. Wait for the reorganization."

The resolution passed by CWC sought to assuage the feelings of the disappointed workers by promising "to create within the party opportunities and structures that will pave the way for a "thorough revamp of the organization at all levels".
