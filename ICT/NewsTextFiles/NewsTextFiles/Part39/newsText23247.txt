Democratic Rep. Bob Rita of Blue Island sent a letter to House Speaker Michael Madigan and Republican leader Jim Durkin on Monday hoping to gain support for his plan. The proposal has two options. One adds five casinos and slots at horse tracks. The other calls for a mega-casino in Chicago.

Lawmakers have proposed changes to allow slot machines at the Fairmount Park horse track in Collinsville. Public hearings convinced Rita they would hurt an East St. Louis casino. Republican Rep. Dwight Kay of Glen Carbon says banning them would kill the track.
