
Police are investigating a double homicide after the bodies of two women were found in Auckland.

INVESTIGATING: Police work at the Ranui address where the bodies of two women were found.

Police say two women found dead at a West Auckland house this morning were stabbed to death.

Police were called to the Pooks Rd, Rainu, address about 10am.

Detective Inspector Greg Cramer this afternoon said the Pakistani women, one aged in her 50s and the other in her 20s, died some time this morning.

A man living at the address had called police at about 10am and he was helping them with their enquiries. Police weren't looking for anybody else in relation to the incident , Cramer said.

Police believed the three to be related, "but until formal identification has taken place we can't say". A autopsy would take place tomorrow morning.

The scene was still being forensically examined and the bodies would be removed later tonight, he said.

Neighbours were shocked by deaths.

Peter Kake has lived on Ranui Ave, close to the house where the bodies were found, for 11 years.

After arriving home and finding Pooks Rd cordoned off police told him they were investigating a double murder of a mother and daughter.

Rob Nixon has lived next door to the family for three years and said they were a "pleasant" family. Two sons visited occasionally but didn't live there.

The deaths were a "shock" and Nixon said the family were quiet. Occasionally they'd say hello and Nixon believed the husband was a bus driver.

Nixon said he had never heard any arguments or noise coming from the house.

Another neighbour who didn't want to be named also confirmed police told her there had been a double homicide but they wouldn't reveal anything further.

"Holy hell. I know Ranui's not the finest area but two dead bodies? I wasn't expecting that," a neighbour said.

A police cordon on Pooks Rd was extended to Ranui train station and traffic was diverted.
