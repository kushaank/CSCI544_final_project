
This Monday, May 19th, Latvia is expected to experience a strong heat wave, as reported by the State Environmental, Geology and Meteorology Centre.

Air temperature will reach +27° C…+32° C in the central and south-east parts of Latvia. Western parts of Latvia can expect air temperature to reach +33° C.

This Sunday, the first summer heat wave entered Latvia – average air temperature was +27° C…+30° C. This kind of weather will remain until the middle of this week.

Air temperature is expected to reach its maximum in Latvia’s eastern regions. It will be somewhat colder along the coast, because water temperature in the Baltic Sea remains low.

Wind speed is expected to rise, as will the risks of thunderstorms. Rain events and hail are also likely.
