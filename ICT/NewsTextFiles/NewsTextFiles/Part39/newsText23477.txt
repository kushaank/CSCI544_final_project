
A RESOLUTION has been filed in the House of Representatives urging the Supreme Court to hold the bar exams, arguably the toughest licensure examination in the country, in the Visayas and Mindanao.

Cagayan de Oro Representative Rufus Rodriguez and brother Abante Mindanao party-list Representative Maximo Rodriguez filed House Resolution 1023 urging the Supreme Court to amend Section 11, Rule 138 (Attorneys and Admission to Bar) of the Rules of Court.

The amendment will allow bar examinations to be held not only in Manila but also in the cities of Cebu and Cagayan de Oro. The decentralization will benefit those who live far from Manila, the lawmakers said.
