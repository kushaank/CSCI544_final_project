
Oxus Gold, a company invested in the Amantaytau Goldfields (AGF) in Uzbekistan, reported a reduced annual loss, but told investors its main activities remained ‘materially uncertain’ and were dependent on the outcome of its dispute with the Uzbek government.

For the 12 months ended December 31st, the group, which is currently not undertaking any operational activities, reported a loss of $4.58m, compared to $6.84m in 2012. The loss is after deducting arbitration expenses of $2.14m (2012: $3.11m) and financial expenses of $1.30m (2012: $1.75m).

There was a decrease in total group assets $75.46m (2012: $75.82m), including cash and cash equivalents of $0.82m (2012: $1.04m).

The firm confirmed that the arbitration process relating to its Khandiza and Amantaytau Goldfields mining/exploration assets was progressing, but said it had made no progress in ending the inprisonment of Said Ashurov, who was jailed in 2011 for spying.

The group has pursued arbitration against the Uzbekistan government seeking compensation for the loss of its investment in AGF and for the loss of the Khandiza base metals project in 2006.

It said its ability to continue with the arbitration process has been significantly strengthened through financial support being provided by a litigation funding agreement and equity financing agreement.

The group declared force majeure in March 2011 in relation to AGF and is seeking ‘appropriate compensation’ through international arbitration. It lost the Khandiza base metals project in 2006 within the proceedings.

Although the group is still a going concern, it told investors a ‘material uncertainty exists which may cast significant doubt on the company and the group’s ability to continue as a going concern and, therefore, to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of the business’.

It further explained that once the outcome is known, it plans to consult shareholders on the future direction of the group’s activities.

The share price was 4.56% higher at 0.09p by 14:05 on Monday.
