
Congress leaders unanimously rejected party president Sonia Gandhi and Vice President Rahul Gandhi’s offer to resign at the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting on Monday over the party’s electoral defeat.

“There was no discussion about changes. We have given authority to Sonia Gandhi and accept that we are all responsible for the defeat,” said party leader Beni Prasad Verma.

As the meeting began, a group of youth Congress workers outside the venue shouted pro-Rahul slogans.

The Congress Working Committee (CWC) met in the wake of the party's worst-ever performance in the recently concluded Lok Sabha polls.

Accepting responsibility for the poll debacle, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi had said that the mandate in the Lok Sabha polls was clearly against the Congress and said there was a lot for the party to think about.

Talking about the issue, India's Outgoing Manmohan Singh said, "Resignation of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi is no solution to the problems faced by Congress."

Prior to this, Kamal Nath had defended Rahul Gandhi and said, "Internal democracy can only stop patrongae within Congress and that Rahul Gandhi could not be blamed for Congress debacle.
