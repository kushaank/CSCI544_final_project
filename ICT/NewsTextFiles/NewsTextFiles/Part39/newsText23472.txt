
NCRI - According to the state-run Fars news agency, ten prisoners were collectively hanged in the main prison in city of Kerman, southeastern Iran, on May 18.

On May 17, four prisoners were hanged in city of Qazvin. A report by the state-run Mehr News Agency, affiliated with the regime's Ministry of Intelligence and Security, said three people were executed in Qazvin. On the same day, two other prisoners were hanged in the central prison of Zahedan, capital of Iran's southeastern Sistan and Baluchistan Province.

According to the state-run newspaper Resalat, a prisoner was executed in the central city of Garmsar in Semnan Province, northern Iran, on May 15.

On May 14, four prisoners were hanged in the main prison in the city of Urumiyeh. A day earlier, Majid Jalili Ayan, 37, a resident of city of Salmas, was also hanged in the same prison.

Meanwhile, in a clash with prisoners on May 12, the henchmen of Shahr-e-Kord’s central prison shot two prisoners dead at point blank range.

Elsewhere, a Kurdish prisoner was flogged in public with 90 lashes in the town of Tokab on May 17, in the presence of authorities of the regime’s judiciary official. On the same day, two other prisoners in Qazvin prison were whipped by prison henchmen. Sadeqi, the Qazvin Prosecutor General, stressed the continuation of 'harsh punishments without mercy'.

The number of recorded executions since April 21 has therefore reached 103.

Ignoring all these crimes on the pretext of nuclear negotiations has achieved nothing but to embolden the criminals mullahs ruling Iran.

The only way to stop the cycle of killings in Iran is to refer the catastrophic violation of human rights in Iran to the UN Security Council and to have the regime’s leaders brought to justice.
