Jefferson City • Gov. Jay Nixon’s push to expand Medicaid for Missourians failed.

Nixon argued for taking advantage of 100 percent federal funding for three years, followed by a phased-in, five-year decrease to 90 percent, with the state taking on the remaining 10 percent.

“It’s dead,” Sen. Jason Holsman, D-Kansas City, said Friday.

Holsman said Sen. Ryan Silvey, R-Kansas City, offered a conservative version of Medicaid expansion that deserved passage. The measure included transparency, entitlement reform and a budget-protection provision to hold Missouri harmless if the federal government withheld funds, Holsman said.

“It was a very well-crafted compromise to this problem,” he said.

Silvey declined comment on his bill.

A filibuster threat by Sens. Rob Schaaf and John Lamping prevented passage, Holsman said.

Failure to pass expansion does not mean the legislature snubbed Medicaid entirely.

Lawmakers increased Medicaid funds, he said.

House Speaker Pro Tempore Denny Hoskins said he hopes people can benefit from the dental health funding.

“When most people think about health, they don’t think about dental, and I’ll tell you what, if you’re low income and you need those dental services performed, this will help,” Hoskins said.

Taking a conservative approach to Medicaid expansion could win approval next year, Hoskins said.

Holsman said Medicaid expansion is needed.
