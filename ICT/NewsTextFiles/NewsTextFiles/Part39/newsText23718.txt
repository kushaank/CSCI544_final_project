We know that letting go is not always easy. I remember the mixed emotions of dropping two kids off at college - some weepiness down deep, but also satisfaction that, dang-it, this is what's supposed to happen. People grow up. Times change.

In some weird way, I'm feeling a little of all that today. My daily blog/column, "Behind The News," now in its 13th year, is morphing into an interactive Facebook post. The daily email that several thousand people have received in their inbox since January 2002 will stop being emailed after today.

Times change, and so the need for an email from me about a take on the day's news has changed as well. Back when we started this, Facebook was still 2 years from creation, and we wanted to send out a daily email before people left work for the day. The theory was that after work most peeps didn't check their email.

Like I said, times change.

We've been experimenting for the past three weeks with posting this column on Facebook directly, rather than just posting a link. So far, it's been a great response, and I thank all of you who have expressed yourself and interacted with me and the other posters.

Many friends of mine have said, "you must be sad, not sending out your column."  I really don't feel that way.  This daily column has just grown up. Like sending a kid to college.

For those who are reading this on Facebook, and not via email, thanks for participating. Catch ya 'round campus.

That's what's on my mind as we prep tonight's 11 p.m. newscast.  We'll have any breaking news of the night, plus Meteorologist Jeff Smith (in for Lee Goldberg) with his AccuWeather forecast, and Rob Powers with the night's sports. I hope you can join Sade Baderinwa and me, tonight at 11.
