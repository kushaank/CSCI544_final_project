
NBC News  — A Georgia law that shrouds lethal-injection drugs in secrecy was upheld by the state’s highest court on Monday, though two justices expressed concern the policy could lead to a “macabre” repeat of a  botched Oklahoma execution .

Warren Lee Hill, who was convicted of murdering a fellow inmate with a nail-studded sink leg, argued he has a constitutional right to know which compounding pharmacy is preparing the pentobarbital that will be used to kill him.

The appeals court, in a 5-2 decision, shrugged off concern that the drugs could be tainted and cause side effects such as a precipitous drop in blood pressure or febrile seizures.

“Such a side effect obviously would be shockingly undesirable in the practice of medicine, but it is certainly not a worry in an execution,” the judges wrote.

The court concluded that keeping the name of the pharmacy secret would protect the business and its workers from harassment and retaliation — and keep drug supply lines open.

“Georgia’s execution process is likely made more timely and orderly by the execution-participant confidentiality statute,” the court ruled.
