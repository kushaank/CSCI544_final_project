
SENATE Majority Leader Alan Peter Cayetano on Monday said he will file a resolution calling for the reopening of the investigation into the P728-million fertilize fund scam during the Arroyo administration.

Cayetano said he wants to know if the alleged fertilizer fund scam is interrelated with alleged misuse of the Priority Development Assistance Fund Scam (PDAF) of lawmakers and the Malampaya fund scam.

The senator said that there is a big possibility that these funds were used by the previous administration of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo during the 2004 national elections.

"Makikita natin kung ano ang relasyon ng fertilizer scam sa PDAF at Malampaya scam kapag muling nabuksan ang isyu para sa imbestigasyon." Cayetano said.

Earlier, the Senate through former Senator Ramon Magsaysay Jr. investigated the fertilizer fund scam in 2006 and 2008. Former Agriculture undersecretary Jocelyn "Jocjoc" Bolante was one of the officials who were accused of involvement in the fertilizer scam.

In an unsigned affidavit, alleged pork scam queen Janet Napoles admitted that she was part of the fertilizer fund scam and the exclusive distributor and owner of Nutrigrowth Philippines, a known manufacturer of the Liquid Foliar Fertilizers, which was confirmed overpriced through the help of unscrupulous government officials.
