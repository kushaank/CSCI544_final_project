
Amid the logjam over the leadership question in the ruling JD(U), the Congress legislature met here today and authorised its central leadership to take a decision  on whether to continue supporting it or not.

The CLP meeting apprised the Congress central leadership of the present political situation in Bihar and authorised them to take a decision, CLP leader Sadanand Singh told reporters.

Asked whether the Congress would continue to support the JD(U) government in Bihar, Singh said "So far we have not  withdrawn support. But the future course of action has to be decided by the high command."

Besides, Singh, PCC president and lone Congress MLC Ashok Choudhary and three Congress MLAs attended the meeting.

The Congress had voted for Kumar in the trust vote after his split from the NDA in June last year. In the parliamentary elections it went with Lalu Prasad's RJD but did not withdraw support to the  JD(U) government.

Its support is crucial for the continuation of the JD(U) government in the state.

In the effective strength of 239 in the Bihar assembly at present, the JD(U) has 117 MLAs  ( including the speaker), the BJP has 90 members, the RJD 21, the Congress 4,  the CPI 1 and the rest are independents.

During the trust motion in June last year, Nitish Kumar sailed through with the help of  the 4 Congress MLAs, the independents and the CPI.
