More than 30 young children have been killed in a fire on a broken-down bus in Colombia.

The tragedy happened in the north of the country as they were returning from a church event, near the city of Fundacion.

It is not known why the blaze started. Media reports have suggested a link with an engine problem or contraband petrol.

Officials say the driver had tried to start the faulty bus, which was said to be overcrowded, by pouring fuel into the engine which he accessed through the floor of the cabin. He escaped unharmed and is reportedly being questioned by police.

Around 20 other people survived the blaze, suffering serious burns.

The bus was owned by a private transport company and was used during the week to take children to and from school.

President Juan Manuel Santos was traveling to Fundacion to console relatives of the victims.
