
Ferring Pharmaceuticals marks World IBD Day (May 19th) with the launch of Guts4life (www.guts4life.com), a new interactive website with information, support and inspiration for people concerned with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, conditions known as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). IBD describes a range of chronic diseases of the gastrointestinal system characterised by intermittent flares with debilitating symptoms that can affect a patient's quality of life and lead to emotional distress and social isolation. Guts4life was designed together with IBD patients to provide support and encouragement throughout the IBD journeyâ€”from bowel symptom worries, to diagnosis, through managing and living with IBD.

"Being diagnosed with IBD can be a life changing event for the patient but also friends and family," said Dr. Johan Masure, Global Medical Director, Gastroenterology/Endocrinology at Ferring. "With Guts4Life aimed at IBD sufferers and those close to them, Ferring aims to provide information that will increase understanding of the condition and how best to handle it."

Information for people worried about bowel problems including an interactive "Symptom Checker"

Martin Kojinkov, of the European Federation of Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis Associations (EFCCA), said "With deep information and useful features, I believe Guts4life will be an important resource for IBD patients."

Elisabeth Weis, Senior Director, Global Marketing, Gastroenterology/Endocrinology at Ferring added "Ferring is committed to making a difference in people's health and quality of life. We were pleased to work with the European Federation of Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis Associations in developing Guts4life for the benefit of IBD patients and their families."
