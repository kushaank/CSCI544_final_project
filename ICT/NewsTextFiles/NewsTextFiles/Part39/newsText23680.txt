A 63-year-old Dover woman has died from injuries she sustained in a May 12 crash with a state police cruiser on U.S. 113 south of Georgetown, state police said Monday.

Anezia Valette was a passenger in a car driven by Marie Voltaire, 37, of Dover. After the crash Valette was taken to Nanticoke Memorial Hospital in Seaford, where she died Friday.

The crash, reported at 3:37 p.m., happened as Voltaire, driving a 1999 Toyota Corolla, was southbound in the right lane on Du Pont Boulevard (U.S. 113), just north of Speedway Road. For an unknown reason, the Corolla drifted into the left lane, the left turn lane, and then onto the grass median, where it struck a marked Delaware State Police 2013 Chevrolet Tahoe head on, Cpl. John Day said.

The 31-year-old male trooper, assigned to Troop 4 in Georgetown, was parked in the median monitoring traffic on an Office of Highway Safety sponsored seat belt-enforcement detail. No emergency equipment was activated at the time.

The trooper was taken by ambulance to Beebe Medical Center in Lewes where he was treated for minor injuries and released. Voltaire and her passenger, Valette, both were taken to Nanticoke by ambulance. Voltaire was admitted with non-life-threatening injuries.

The occupants of both vehicles were properly restrained at the time of the crash, Day said.

On the day of the crash, Voltaire was issued a traffic summons for failing to remain in a single lane. Police are continuing investigation into the crash.
