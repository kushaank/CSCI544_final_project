
The Riga Central District Court on May 16 ordered National Bolshevik activist Beness Aijo taken into custody, who the Security Police have started a criminal process against for incitement to violently overthrow the government of Latvia and change the political system, as well as liquidate Latvia's national independence, reports LETA.

Aijo was initially detained by the Security Police at Riga Airport on May 14.

The Security Police said in a statement to the press that Aijo was expelled from Ukraine after he, despite banned from entering the country for three years, nevertheless tried to cross into Ukraine together with another two activists, and was detained by the Ukrainian Border Guard. State Border Guard spokeswoman Kristine Petersone confirmed to LETA that Aijo was detained at Riga Airport after arriving on a flight from Ukraine.

This is the second case started against Aijo for inciting people to violently overthrow the government and alter the political system.

The Security Police opened initially opened a criminal case against the National Bolsheviks in December 2004, after evaluating a letter received at the newspaper Diena from Aijo on Oct. 17, 2004, that, the Security Police said, included incitement to overthrow the government.

In the above mentioned letter, Aijo expressed hostile views against Latvian law enforcement institutions, the Latvian president, the government and the Riga City Council. The letter was not printed in Diena.

Aijo was initially handed down a nine-month prison sentence for his crime; however, this decision was appealed in 2005. He was later handed down a 9,600 lats (13,700 euros) fine by the Supreme Court.
