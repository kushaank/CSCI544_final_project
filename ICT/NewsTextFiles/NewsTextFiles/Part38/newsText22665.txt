
As for the ladies, Kandi still talks to “most of them,” but doesn’t mention Kenya. (She is Team Porsha, after all!) While she admits that Porsha and Kenya aren’t fired from next season, she isn’t a big fan of Ms. Twirl: “Don’t write a check that your ass can’t cash.” Ouch!

Kandi says that all the ladies will most likely return to the series.

As for that other show, Kandi tells HollywoodLife.com all about Love and Hip Hop star Mimi Faust’s sex tape. Kandi infamously filmed an Instagram video, mocking Mimi’s X-rated shower rod scene. If you haven’t seen it yet, click HERE !

Kandi admits that she hasn’t seen the sex tape in its entirety, but she saw enough just from the trailer. (Um, so did we.) She also has yet to buy herself her very own “Mimi Rod,” but after her video, she definitely needs a new one!

HollywoodLifers, did you laugh at Kandi’s Instagram video? Do you think that she was making fun of Mimi or was it all in good fun? And do you wish that any of the RHOA ladies would be fired? Let us know!

I think all of the housewives of atlanta are gaining up on kenya moore. Maybe because she looks the best they are some haters especially that mouse Nene.

I agree! Porsha accused Kenya of playing the victim And then attacked her physically! Then fell to the floor (like a child having a tantrum), screaming, “I been through so much!” REALLY?! One would have thought YOU were the one attacked! ‘Victim!’ Kenya, stay strong! Keep fighting with words!
