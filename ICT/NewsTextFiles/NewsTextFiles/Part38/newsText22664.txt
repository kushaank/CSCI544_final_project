
Culture Days of Astana held in St. Petersburg with a great success of Kazakhstan creative teams. They performed at the stages of famous theaters of Russia's cultural capital. In few days Masters of Arts of the Republic showed to the Russian audience a diverse and vibrant program: performance ‘Astana Ballet’ troupe, State Chamber Orchestra concert and exhibition of paintings by Kazakhstan artists.

- For us, Kazakhstan people, performing for Russian people, of course, is a big responsibility. We represent bright, original art of the brightest stars, representatives of Kazakhstan.

- It is really great that our people are friendly and organize such events, I would like more.
