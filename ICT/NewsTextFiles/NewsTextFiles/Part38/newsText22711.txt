
NAIROBI May 19 (Reuters) - Kenya's central bank sought to mop up 2 billion shillings ($22.84 million)from the market on Monday saying there was excess liquidity.

The bank has regularly soaked up excess liquidity from the money market since last year, which has lent support to the shilling, by making it more expensive for banks to hold long dollar positions.
