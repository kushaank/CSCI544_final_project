
South Korea said Monday that it is considering sending a message of condolence to North Korea over a recent deadly collapse of an apartment building in Pyongyang that has claimed an unspecified number of casualties.

A Red Cross official said that an internal review is under way to determine whether to send a message, though he did not say when a final decision will be made.

Unification ministry spokesman Kim Eui-do told reporters that the Red Cross will make an appropriate judgment on the case.

The move came a day after North Korea reported that an apartment building collapsed in the Phyongchon District in Pyongyang.

North Korea has said improper construction and irresponsible supervision of the high-rise construction are responsible for the disaster.

Senior North Korean officials have offered a rare public apology to a group of North Korean people in what could be the first public apology over an accident in the communist country.
