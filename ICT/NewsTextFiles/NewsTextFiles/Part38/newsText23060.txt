
Libya's capital is on high alert Monday following Sunday's attack on the parliament in which rebel brigades led by a former general stormed the General National Congress, according to the Associated Press.

"The government condemns the expression of political opinion through the use of armed force," Libyan Justice Minister Salah Al Marghani said in a statement. "It calls for an immediate end of the use the military arsenal ... and calls on all sides to resort to dialogue and reconciliation."

Libya's central government has come under severe public scrutiny since its installment in 2011 following the overthrow of former dictator Moammar Gaddafi, with many people blaming Tripoli for the country's deteriorating security situation as well as corruption charges.

Haftar is a former general who defected from the Libyan army in the late 1980s. He spent his exile in the United States before returning to Libya in 2011 to participate in the uprising against Gaddafi. He is often suspected and accused of working with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.
