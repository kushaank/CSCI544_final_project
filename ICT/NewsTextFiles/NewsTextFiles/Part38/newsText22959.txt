
BOWLING GREEN, Ky. (WBKO) -- Graduation means the end of another school year, and restaurants in town say not having the WKU students here over the summer could affect their business.

Employees at Griff's Deli say they hire students, so they'll be losing some workers until they return after summer.

It's not just employees they're worried about, they say they'll lose some student customers as well.

"It'll definitely die off here for a little while, but we're a very family-oriented place, so kids that are out of school will be here a lot with their parents, of course," said Jordan Elmore, who works at Griff's Deli.

Despite the movement, he says Griff's will still stay busy -- just with different customers than during the school year.
