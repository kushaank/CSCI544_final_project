
SAN DIEGO (AP) â€” The fat lady sang at the San Diego Opera, but it's back for an encore anyway.

Two months after saying it was closing for good, the opera announced Monday that it would hold a 2015 season.

The opera's board had voted overwhelmingly in March to shut down because of a big budget shortfall.

But the subsequent outcry from fans, workers and politicians brought a crowd-funding effort that raised more than $3 million and made the new season possible.

Board president Carol Lazier said in a statement that "the public spoke, we listened, and we're open for business."

The new season will include Mozart's "Don Giovanni" and Puccini's "La Boheme."
