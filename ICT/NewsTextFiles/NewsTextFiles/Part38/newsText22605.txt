
Hundreds of same-sex marriage advocates and supporters convened at Oregon United for Marriage's campaign headquarters to hear the ruling on the state's ban on gay marriage. The ban was effectively struck down by a Eugene judge.

Oregon same-sex marriage advocates rejoice as Judge Michael McShane's decision, to overturn a ban on gay marriage, is announced.

Judge Michael McShane has overturned Oregon's 10-year-old ban on same-sex marriage in the state.

As word of the ruling broke, same-sex couples began getting marriage licenses at Multnomah County Courthouse. Many will be married this afternoon at celebrations taking place at the Melody Ballroom, in Southeast Portland.

"Love wins!" wrote Oregon United for Marriage in a text sent out to supporters. "Judge rules OR ban unconstitutional.

The lawsuit had alleged that Oregonâ€™s constitutional ban on marriage for lesbian and gay couplesâ€”Measure 36, which passed in 2004, â€”violates the U.S. Constitution.

McShane overturned the ban after deeming, earlier today, that an anti-gay marriage group couldn't stay his decision.

â€œMarriage equality is about fairness. Itâ€™s about justice. Itâ€™s about caring,â€� said Peter Courtney , president of the Oregon Senate.

â€œThe importance of Judge McShane â€™s decision cannot be overemphasized,â€� said David Fidanque , executive director of the ACLU of Oregon. â€œOur federal constitution does not allow any state â€“ or its voters â€“ to deny same sex couples equal protection under the law simply because of who they are and who they love. This type of discrimination is wrong and itâ€™s also unconstitutional."

Oregon House Speaker Tina Kotek said she and her partner Aimee will be getting married this year after a 10-year engagement.

â€œTodayâ€™s historic ruling means that all Oregonians will have the legal right to marry the person they love," said Kotek, a Portland Democrat.
