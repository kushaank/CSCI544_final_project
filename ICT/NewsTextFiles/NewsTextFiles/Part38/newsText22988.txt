
With reference to the Vestas Wind Systems A/S company announcement No. 22/2014 of 19 May 2014, Vestas has received an order of 148 MW from First Wind for V112-3.0 MW turbines in the U.S.

Vestas has received an order for 48 V112-3.0 MW turbines for the 148-MW Oakfield project in the state of Maine. The order is a call-off on the master supply agreement (MSA) announced in December 2013 for multiple U.S. projects, the potential of which totals 718 MW. With todays order, Vestas has secured 298 MW under this MSA.

The highly popular V112-3.0 MW turbines for which Vestas has already received almost 6 GW of orders will be supplied for this project. The project will also include a 10-year Active Output Management (AOM) 5000 service agreement. AOM 5000 is an energy-based availability guarantee that ensures the turbines are operational when the wind is blowing. This service option includes the VestasOnline® surveillance system that remotely controls and monitors the turbines and minimizes lost production by predicting when maintenance may be required.

"We're pleased to continue the construction of the Oakfield Wind project and look forward to installing Vestas V112-3.0 MW turbines there," said First Wind CEO Paul Gaynor. "The Vestas turbines at our Bull Hill project in Maine and the Palouse project in Washington State have performed well and we expect the Oakfield project to enjoy similar success."

Deliveries for the Oakfield project will take place in the 2nd quarter of 2015, with commissioning expected by the 4th quarter of 2015. Vestas factories in Colorado are expected to be involved in the manufacturing for this project. To meet customer demand, Vestas is adding more workers at three of its Colorado factories the blade factory in Windsor as well as the blade and nacelle factories in Brighton. Vestas is recruiting now and expects to add hundreds of production workers in the first half of 2014 in Windsor and Brighton, primarily at the two blade factories.
