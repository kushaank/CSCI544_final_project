
SALT LAKE CITY – A rally was held in Liberty Park Sunday to honor the victims who were injured, lost or killed when a South Korean ferry capsized.

The event was organized by Missy USA, a website that caters to Korean and Korean American women living in the U.S., and similar rallies were held in New York, Chicago, Washington D.C. and other major cities.

Eun Young Martineau attended the event and spoke about its purpose.

Event organizers said in an email that they believe the South Korean government “is not making a sincere and best effort to find missing passengers and/or to ease the pain of the victims’ families.” They said they wish to encourage the South Korean government to take responsibility for the issues and be more transparent.
