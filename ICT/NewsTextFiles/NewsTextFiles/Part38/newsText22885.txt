The large space contractor, the area's largest private-sector aerospace employer, is relocating 350 employees from its Newtown, Pennsylvania, site to its headquarters near the mouth of Waterton Canyon in Jefferson County.

A few employees have already made the move, but most of the relocating workers will arrive in June and July after a new commercial space operations center is fleshed out on the campus.

"By the latter part of this year, we will have consolidated the vast majority of commercial space business here," said Mike Hamel, a former Air Force lieutenant general and space program expert who was named president of the Commercial Ventures business at Lockheed Martin Space Systems (LMSS) in December.

The Denver area's job growth comes amid consolidation for parent company Lockheed Martin Corp. nationally. Late last year, the company (NYSE: LMT) decided to close the Newtown manufacturing site and move the commercial space business done there to new cleanrooms and offices at LMSS headquarters.
