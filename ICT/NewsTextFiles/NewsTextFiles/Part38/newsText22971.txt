
The most anticipated and well-attended of the Savannah Area Chamber’s networking events is the Taste of Downtown Business Connection. Back for its 13th year, this event will be held from 5:30-7:30 p.m. May 22.

Make plans to join us and sample dishes from more than 40 Savannah area member restaurants and caterers, network and listen to live music by Junkyard Angel in picturesque Johnson Square.

Last year, 2,000 attendees enjoyed fine coastal cuisine and beverages while connecting with other area professionals. People do business with people they know, and the 13th annual Taste of Downtown Business Connection is the perfect opportunity to exercise your membership and make new contacts.

Complimentary parking will be provided in the Bryan and Whitaker Street parking garages from 5-8 p.m. Please write “Taste” on the back of your parking ticket to redeem. All employees of member companies may attend for the member rate; however, this is a private event only open to Chamber members and their guests.

No RSVP is necessary.
