WELLFLEET — If you want to park in Wellfleet, it will still be free, unlike Provincetown, as long as you abide by the new rules that take effect June 15 to Labor Day from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., seven days a week. The rules, as approved by the selectmen Tuesday, are simple. Two hour parking on Main Street and in the Preservation Hall Lot and the Town Hall parking lot, with the exception of the back rows of the Town Hall lot where four hour parking will be allowed.

Police on their rounds will use chalk to mark car tires so that tickets can be issued for cars that park longer than permitted. The fine that will be imposed is still awaiting approval at the State House.

All’s well and good in Wellfleet right? Not really. Nothing has changed except they increased the one-hour limit on parking to two hours, and will now start enforcing it, with signs to alert drivers.

But the situation is still pretty glum according to some.

“Let’s not kid ourselves, we are not solving the problem,” said Selectman Paul Pilcher.

Tim King, assistant town administrator, said he talked to the ministers of the Congregational and Methodist churches, and both are “very generous in wanting to work with the community to ease the parking problem.” They are willing to come up with a plan that would allow businesses to pay a fee so that their employees would be able to park in the church lots,” he said.

Harry Terkanian, town administrator, said he viewed the need for parking for businesses as the most serious problem “Someone working for an eight-hour shift takes up a parking space that could be used multiple times by customers and visitors,” he noted.
