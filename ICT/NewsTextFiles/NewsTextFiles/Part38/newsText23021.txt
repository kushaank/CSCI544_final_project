
BEIRUT: Speaker Nabih Berri Monday called a meeting of Parliament later this week to discuss an appeal to the legislature by President Michel Sleiman to elect a new head of state.

Berri set the parliamentary session for Wednesday, his office said.

In a rare move by a Lebanese head of state, Sleiman Friday called on Parliament to elect a new president to avoid the risks that would incur if a successor was not selected before the end of his term on May 25.

Parliament “should work in line with the Constitution and the law to fulfill the presidential election to avoid the dangers and risks that may arise due to the non-election of a president before May 25,” Sleiman said, in a letter addressed to the assembly.

This week Parliament failed its fourth attempt to hold a second round of voting for a new president. After no candidate managed to achieve the needed two-thirds majority in the first round of voting, many March 8 MPs have boycotted the last four attempts to hold a second, thwarting the necessary quorum.

Berri adjourned Thursday's session to May 22.
