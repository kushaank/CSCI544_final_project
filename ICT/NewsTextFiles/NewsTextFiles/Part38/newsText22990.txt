UNITED STATES - For more than two weeks now, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome has been detected in the United States.

The first U.S. case of the viral illness was reported in Indiana and involved someone who traveled from Saudi Arabia. Another reported case involves a health care worker who traveled from there to Orlando, Florida.

Another person in Illinois may have gotten MERS from face-to-face contact with the Indiana patient, according to the CDC. All three patients are recovering or are no longer sick.

The viral MERS situation is being closely monitored by U.S. health officials.

People with MERS develop severe acute respiratory illness and usually have a fever, cough and shortness of breath. The CDC reports, to date, about 30 percent of those with MERS have died.
