
In a very emotional televised address, South Korean President Park Geun-hye apologized to the families of the victims of the recent ferry accident, saying she is “ultimately responsible” for the disaster.

Adding that the disaster leaves “wounds that will be difficult to remove,” Park wept as she read the names of the passengers and crew who suffered in the sinking ship because they stayed to help passengers get out. The captain and other crew members who bailed out on the first rescue boats, leaving everybody behind, were indicted for negligence and homicide.

Park also committed to disbanding the Korean Coast Guard for failing to fulfill their duties, which led to more than 300 people dead or missing. She maintained that if the coast guard where more assertive and quicker with its response, the number of casualties would have been significantly lesser.

Although no exact period was provided by Park, she mentioned that the coast guard’s disaster response functions will be given to a national safety agency.
