
More than 100 jobs at gun maker Remington Arms in the Mohawk Valley are being sent to a new plant in Alabama. Rumors have surrounded the future of the plant for more than a year.

The two-century-old Remington Arms is the nucleus of Ilion. About 1,300 people work at the plant, in a town of only about 8,000.

But this week Remington’s owners announced it will move two of Ilion’s production lines to a new factory in Alabama. One of the products is the Bushmaster assault rifle, a gun now illegal in New York under the January 2013 stricter gun control laws the state enacted.

State Senator Jim Seward put the blame on that legislation. His office says between 100-150 people will begin losing their jobs in July.

Tax subsidies and a friendly attitude towards guns lured Remington to Alabama earlier this year. Workers at the plant have been worried since New York passed new gun laws the plant would close or be downsized.
