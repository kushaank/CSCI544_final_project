
Kim Kardashian, Kanye West's Wedding Will Be a "Fairytale Day," "Hollywood Movie Set Level"

Nothing but the best for the future Mr. and Mrs. West! Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are sparing no expense in anticipation of their much-anticipated international wedding weekend, which kicks off this Friday, May 23, in Paris, France. As previously reported, the superstar couple have booked the stately Forte di Belvedere in Florence, Italy, as one of their wedding locations -- and preparations at the venue are already well under way.

"We are up to our necks with this wedding," a worker from a local company told Us. "The security surrounding this is huge...The organizers let us know day by day what they need."

Florence is a special place for the bride and groom-to-be, who got engaged on Kardashian's 33rd birthday last year. In an interview with a local paper earlier this month, West, 36, said he thinks their daughter North, 11 months, was conceived there, "among the Renaissance masterpieces."
