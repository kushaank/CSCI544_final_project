
The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide whether an air marshal should receive federal whistleblower protections over his 2003 disclosure to the media of what he thought was a life-threatening policy decision by the Transportation Security Administration.

The air marshal, Robert MacLean, was dismissed for telling MSNBC that TSA had discontinued posting air marshals on overnight flights from Las Vegas despite a recent alert a new plot to hijack U.S. airliners may have been underfoot. Mr. MacLean, who had more than a dozen years of service in other federal positions before becoming an air marshal, had first sought to raise an alarm within the agency, but failed to persuade officials to reconsider their plans.

Once it became news, the story led to an outcry on Capitol Hill and prompted the agency to reverse itself and continue to assign air marshals to the flights.

TSA discovered Mr. MacLean disclosed the information after recognizing his voice in a separate “NBC Nightly News” segment that ran the following year. Mr. MacLean appeared in disguise on the NBC news program, anonymously saying the dress code made agents too easy to spot.

Last year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in his favor , concluding that he ought to have been allowed to pursue a whistleblower defense during administrative proceedings.

Federal whistleblower laws are supposed to protect against the very sort of retaliation that Mr. MacLean alleges, the court concluded.

But lawyers for the government argue that the whistleblower law was never intended to shield employees who disclose sensitive information about security — what the government says Mr. MacLean leaked.

Mr. MacLean says he didn’t put lives at risk but sought to save them. He blew the whistle because he was “severely troubled about vulnerability from abandoning terrorist defenses during an emergency alert, and was unwilling to give up so easily,” his attorney said in court papers.
