
A local magistrate on Monday dropped the case against Detained Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent Joel Cox for illegal possession of arms, a private news channel reported.

The FBI agent was presented before the Malir Judicial Magistrate.

Cox’s lawyer Barrister Zahid told the court that the FBI agent was on a special mission in Pakistan and was therefore permitted to carry arms, adding that any misuse of the arms by Cox has not been proved.

The lawyer also submitted a letter from the US embassy in the court.

Cox was detained by Pakistani authorities on May 7, when he was found to be carrying a pistol magazine,bullets and knives while boarding a flight to Islamabad from Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport.

The Judge didn't do this on balance of evidence but on instructions from the paymasters, the US put a few million more $'s in Sharif's account. This was the ideal oppurtunity to secure the release of Dr Afia. Beggers Nawaz and Shabaz once again sold Pakistan and it's judiciary.

What would have happened if a Pakistani was caught with the same items while boarding a plane in the US? Would an excuse of a "simple mistake" be enough? This is just another example of the judiciary being not so independent after all.

by the way the FBI agent resembles PATHAN (PAKHTOON) community….. has any one thought about this?? I think he may even speak Pashtoo frequently and had operated with terrorist organizations in Pakistan… I hope every body would agree with me that he did not come here to observe progress of Lahore Metro Bus Service / celebrate Yom-e-Shohada with Pakistanis ? Would appreciate comments of nations please………..

Never let the facts get in the way of a good conspiracy theory…the FBI aGent was in Pakistan to teach a class in anti corruption investigating to Pakistani police…nothing more…the rest of your speculation is just conjecture..
