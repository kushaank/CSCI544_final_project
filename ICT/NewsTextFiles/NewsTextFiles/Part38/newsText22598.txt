
The Supreme Court on Monday ruled out giving any respite to self-styled godman Asaram Bapu in a rape case of a minor at his ashram,and instead,posted July 3 as the next date of hearing of the matter.

Speaking outside the court, prosecutor P.C Solanki said: "The court was not convinced to pass any effective order in favour of Asaram. Neither notice has been issued, nor, has it been stayed. The case will be heard again on 3rd July. No hearing took place today."

Asaram had approached SC seeking bail and dropping of charges under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

The self-claimed godman has challenged the minor status of the alleged victim, claiming that she was born in 1995 and not in 1997, as stated by her father.

The self-styled godman has been lodged in a jail since September 2, 2013 after he was booked in the sexual assault case. He was hopeful about getting bail in Monday's hearing in the SC.

Asaram, 72, was arrested on September 1 on allegations of sexual assault on a minor at his ashram in Jodhpur.

Asaram Bapu has been booked under Sections 376, 342, 506 and 509 of the IPC, Section 8 of the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) and Sections 23 and 26 of the Juvenile Justice Act.
