
LONG BEACH >> Collective bargaining, campus planning, sustainability initiatives and a presentation on a new nursing program’s first graduating class are on tap for today’s meeting of Cal State University trustees.

Two Doctor of Nursing Practice programs, which are partnerships between CSU Fresno and San Jose State University, and CSU Fullerton-Long Beach-Los Angeles, are graduating 59 students this year, and trustees will learn more about the success of the programs, part of which will alleviate the lack of nursing faculty.

Some of the students will feature their research from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Wednesday in the Wallace Room of the Office of the Chancellor at 401 Golden Shore, where the trustees hold their regular meetings.

Trustees also will consider employee contract proposals, including with the State Employees Trades Council-United union, and the CSU Employees Union English Language Program Instructors at Cal State Los Angeles.

Uhlenkamp said several employee agreements expire June 30.

Other agenda items include approving capital programs for building construction and renovations, and the adoption of a revised sustainability plan that aims to include more sustainability and climate-science teaching in CSU education.

Part of the plan includes increasing sustainable food purchases to 20 percent of the total food budget by 2020 across CSU’s 23 campuses and cutting the solid waste disposal rate by 50 percent by 2016, by 80 percent by 2020, and then to zero waste.

The trustees are scheduled to meet in open session today, starting at 11 a.m., and Wednesday, starting at 8 a.m. The meetings take place in the Dumke Auditorium in the Office of the Chancellor.
