
A group of 152 Cambodian peacekeeping forces arrived home this morning after having successfully accomplished their peacekeeping mission under the UN umbrella in South Sudan.

The Home-coming Ceremony was held at Phnom Penh Military Airbase under the presidency of H.E. Gen. Moeung Samphan, Secretary of State for National Defense and H.E. Ms. Claire Van der Vaeren, UN Resident Coordinator for Cambodia.

The group is composed of Military Police Company 711 and Level-2 Hospital Company 808, said Gen. Sem Sovanny, Director-General of the National Center for Peacekeeping Forces Management, Mines and Explosive Remnants of War Clearance (NPMEC), summarizing the activities of the two units during their one-year mission in South Sudan.

H.E. Ms. Claire Van der Vaeren expressed her appreciation to the Cambodian peacekeeping forces’ achievements and contribution to peace building in South Sudan. “Your work shines a light on Cambodia’s commitment to peace, security and friendship. These are the very values at the core of the United Nations, which was set up to save future generations from ‘the scourge of war’,” she underlined.

For his part, H.E. Gen. Moeung Samphan laid stress on the country’s pride, stressing that in the last twenty years, Cambodia used to be a country who received the Blue Helmets, but in return the troops of this country are wearing Blue Helmets and joining in UN peacekeeping operations in many hot places around the world. “Cambodian flag is hoisting among others in all missions and this reflects that Cambodia has a strong commitment for the contribution of building and maintaining peace in the world,” he added.

Since 2006, Cambodia has dispatched a total of 2,110 personnel to the UN peacekeeping missions in Sudan, Central Africa, Chad, Lebanon, Syria, South Sudan, Cyprus and Mali.
