
A Tube driver has been suspended after sparking a row with a colleague over a poster of the Queen, it emerged today.

The argument broke out after a Central Line driver objected to the poster that his colleague had placed on the wall of a tube depot in east London.

London Underground bosses suspended the royalist driver and removed his poster as well as a photo of the monarch he had on his desk.

But the Central Line worker who complained said the issue was about wider allegations of bullying and intimidation, including on social media.

It is understood the two drivers had clashed repeatedly because they had ‘vastly differing political allegiances’.

The pair belong to rival unions  - the suspended driver being an Aslef member while the complainant is an RMT member.

The worker who complained said the stress involved with the case has forced him to take sick leave.

He told the Evening Standard: “I’ve had a lot of time off work with stress with threats made against my family and my home.

The driver’s union has branded the suspension ‘bizarre’ and wants the decision reversed, it emerged tonight.

Aslef’s Finn Brennan said the suspended worker denied all allegations of harassment adding: “It is extraordinary that a public corporation under the control of Boris Johnson is instructing staff to remove photographs of the Queen.

The pictures had been on display for a year before being taken down on Friday last week.
