
ABU DHABI, May 19 (Yonhap) -- South Korean President Park Geun-hye arrived in the United Arab Emirates on Monday for a ceremony marking the installation of a Korean-built nuclear reactor at a power plant under construction in the Middle Eastern nation.

It is the first out of four reactors South Korea plans to provide the UAE under a 2009 deal that marked South Korea's first exports of nuclear reactors. This week's delivery means that a Korean-built nuclear reactor will make its international debut after passing safety tests, officials said.

During Park's two-day visit, the two countries are also expected to conclude discussions on South Korea winning the lucrative right to operate the first power plant scheduled to be completed in 2017. Seoul is seeking to win operation contracts for all four power plants.

The three other power plants are scheduled to be completed in 2018-2020.

Park plans to attend the reactor installation ceremony together with the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The two leaders also plan to hold talks on ways to expand cooperation not only in the nuclear industry but also in other areas, such as the national defense, policing, medical and education fields, officials said.

Park and Mohammed last met in February when the crown prince visited Seoul.

During Park's visit, the two countries also plan to sign three memorandums of agreement that call for greater cooperation in cultivating manpower in the nuclear power plant industry, officials said.

Park had originally planned to make a trip to other Middle East nations, but she cut back the trip only to a visit to the UAE in the wake of the deadly sinking of the ferry Sewol. Officials said the UAE has asked strongly for Park's attendance at the reactor installation ceremony.
