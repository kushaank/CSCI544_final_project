
BEIRUT--( BUSINESS WIRE )--       Africell Holding signs an agreement with the Orange Group to acquire its        majority stake in Orange Uganda.

The transaction upon completion, following regulatory approval, would        bring Africell’s portfolio to 4 operations with a total market potential        of over 120 million inhabitants.

“Uganda with a population of over 37 million and a penetration rate of        50% was well within the criteria we had set to further expand in Africa        targeting high potential and high growth markets” says Ziad Dalloul,        Chairman and C.E.O of the Africell Group.

Africell would still be looking to add one more market to its portfolio        before end 2015 to further expand and diversify its portfolio to cover        West, Central, and East Africa.

Africell holds a dominant leading market share in Gambia and Sierra        Leone and was able to achieve a 20% market share in the DRC in less than        two years of operations facing well established operators. The group        currently has over 9 million active subscribers and forecasted to reach        11 million by year’s end.

“We are confident in achieving a quick turnaround of the operation in        Uganda; our operating model has proven that we would be able to offer an        attractive proposition to the Ugandan consumer allowing us to quickly        climb the market share ladder and bring the operation into        profitability” adds Elias Arwadi, Chief Operations Officer of the        Africell Group.
