
It was a double act of Lotto luck on the weekend with two Division 1 winners.

Six office workers from Perth wasted no time coming forward to claim one of the prizes which they purchased from The Mall Newsagency in Perth.

The other winning ticket was sold at Quinns Lottery Centre and Newsagency in Quinns Rock and is still to be claimed.

The six office workers, aged in their 30s to 50s, said their syndicate had been running for the two years.

However it was their newest syndicate member, who had only been part of the group for two weeks, who purchased the winning ticket.

"I was late for lunch on the day I bought it but something kept telling me I had to buy a ticket at that moment from that newsagency," the woman said.

The office workers, who will each take home $184,210, said the win would provide financial security as their employment at the company was coming to an end.

"Our contracts finish in a few months so this win provides us with peace of mind and takes the pressure off," one member said.

The winnersâ€™ plans include building a granny flat for parents, jetting off on a family holiday with the kids and grandkids and paying off the mortgage.

For one member whose husband had recently lost his job, the win meant they could now both travel to a family wedding overseas.
