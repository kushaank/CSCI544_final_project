
The Bustamante Industrial Trade Union has expressed outrage at the recent discovery of the fact that salary deductions for various public sector workers in the Ministry of Health and the Regional Health Authorities are not being paid over to the designated recipients.

According to the BITU �this issue must be culled now, with a policy to prevent recurrence immediately put in place�. The BITU added that �it is unthinkable that worse at a time when continued sacrifices and burden bearing are already being extracted from Public Sector workers, that they should be subject to this unprecedented and embarrassing situation�.
