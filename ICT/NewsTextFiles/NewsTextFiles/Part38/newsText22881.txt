The Silver Line could be handed over to Metroâ€™s control within the week, but the public opening date of the long-awaited 11.7-mile Metrorail extension to Reston remains undetermined.

Richard Sarles , general manager of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority , said Monday that â€œweâ€™re now down to less than a handful of items,â€� and Metro expects to control the $3 billion first phase of the Silver Line, which will extend from Tysons Corner to Reston's Wiehle Avenue, in eight days â€” and maybe sooner depending on how fast the contractor clears the last few punch list items.

The so-called â€œoperational readiness date,â€� or ORD, is the next crucial step in the Silver Lineâ€™s evolution, when the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority and its contractor, Bechtel-led Dulles Transit Partners, hands over control of the tracks and related infrastructure to Metro.

â€œWeâ€™re nearly there,â€� he said.

The â€œbobbing track circuitâ€� that caused Metro some concern last week turned out to be a hardware issue, not a system issue. New components will be installed Monday.

Once the ORD passes, Metro will have roughly 90 days to test the line, drill its employees, install signs and familiarize its maintenance teams with the system. Simultaneously, the Tri-State Oversight Committee (a partnership of state-level agencies in D.C., Maryland and Virginia that oversee Metro safety and security) and the Federal Transit Administration will be working to clear the Silver Line for passenger service.
