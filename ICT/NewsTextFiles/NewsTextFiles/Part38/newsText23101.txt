
Tripoli:Â  The Libyan government on Monday proposed an initiative aimed at saving the country from plunging into civil war, calling on the disputed parliament to go into recess, a statement said.

The statement on the government website said that the General National Congress, or parliament, should "take a recess after the vote on the 2014 budget and until new parliamentary elections".

The budget vote had been expected to take place this week amid a dramatic spike in lawlessness in Libya's two largest cities.
