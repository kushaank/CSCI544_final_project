
Nairobi, Kenya: The Law Society of Kenya Monday sought the help of the Law Society of England and Wales in unearthing any conspiracy involving the judge who ordered Kenya to settle the Anglo Leasing debt.

In a letter dated May 19, Law Society of Kenya Chairman Eric Mutua asked the LSEW to investigate the entire case in which Kenya was represented by Solicitor General Njee Muturi.

The judge consequently ordered Kenya to pay the debt worth Sh1.4 billion.

First, the Judge failed to establish from the Solicitor General whether he was properly on record in the case or whether he had a licence to practise in the Courts of England and Wales.

Second, the Judge entered judgment against the Government of Kenya based on hearsay and oral presentation without any documentary evidence on the amounts agreed at the mediation.

Third, the Judge appears to have been casual in dealing with the case by ignoring the weighty matters of corruption and bribery which were pleaded in the defence and counter claim.

Mutual also emphasized that the matter is of public interest in Kenya and also a subject of investigation by various authorities including the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission of Kenya and National Assembly.
