
Newly intensified violence in Libya is an example of NATO-exported democracy, activist and journalist Sukant Chandan told RT. On Sunday, gunmen loyal to rogue General Khalifa Haftar attacked the Libyan parliament and announced its suspension.

Sukant Chandan: It is democracy brought to Libya   on the wings of NATO, which bombed and incinerated Libyans on   behalf of itself and also on the collaborators on the ground. Mr.   Haftar is an old collaborator, he ran into the arms of the CIA   back in the early 1980s, having been a senior member of the   Libyan army. This is what democracy looks like when it is   exported by NATO and its leading powers are based in London and   Washington. And also we have to zoom out and see the bigger   picture, as well, because of the crisis going on in Nigeria with   the terrorist movement there, which is using and abusing Islam.   Even mainstream commentators are trying [to compare] what is   happening in Nigeria to the fallout in Libya. Libya really was   the shield of Africa - thatâ€™s what Gaddafiâ€™s former government   was called.

SC: There are many complex factors and   contradictory factors at play here. First of all, Haftar is an   old army man. And what has been happening in Benghazi, which   hasnâ€™t been reported in the mainstream at all, since 2011, since   this pro-NATO death squad rebellion started, nearly 1,000 members   of Libyaâ€™s former army, police and judiciary have been   systematically assassinated in Benghazi and in the eastern   region. Also, Haftar is an old CIA man, so it could be that the   West, particularly the US, is using him as a trojan to just sound   out what he is capable of because, perhaps your viewers will   know, that the politics of Libya have become just ridiculous.   But, actually the junta in Tripoli has imposed a no fly zone on   Benghazi because Haftar has access to some helicopters and   fighter jets, which he has been using in Benghazi. So, the   situation could be the West testing out what Haftar is capable of   in alliance with other death squads in Libya. And donâ€™t forget   when one leading death squad or militia that has popularity in   the east stopped oil production, but then tried to sell a tanker,   the Navy Seals turned up from the US and got back that ship to   ensure that the oil was going in the right direction, i.e. into   the coffers of London, Paris, and Washington and their primary   allies in the Gulf.
