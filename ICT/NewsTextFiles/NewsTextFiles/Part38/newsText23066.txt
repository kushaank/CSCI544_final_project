Most people never get to drive a supercar but a rather controversial video is showing a young boy taking a Ferrari 458 Italia for a spin in a dirt filled empty lot. The boy tries to do some donuts in front of the cameraman but he still has to improve his driving skills. We’re not sure if he has his dad’s permission but considering the fact that the cameraman seems to be another boy, chances are the answer to this question is “no”. The clip was filmed somewhere in Libya.

Keep in mind that the Ferrari 458 Italia is a rear mid-engine supercar with rear-wheel drive, which has a 4.5 liter V8 engine under its hood. The unit can produce 562 HP (419 kW) at 9,000 rpm and 540 Nm (398 lb-ft) of torque, available at 3,250 rpm. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a 7-speed dual clutch transmission. The supercar has been introduced in 2009 as a successor to the F430 and it’s currently produced in Maranello. This is offered in two body styles, coupe and roadster.
