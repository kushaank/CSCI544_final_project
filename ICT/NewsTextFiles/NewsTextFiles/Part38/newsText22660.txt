
The Eurasian Economic Union is Kazakhstan's future. For the first time in the history of the national coalition of democratic forces «Kazakhstan-2050», an appeal to support the initiative of the President was accepted.

- There is a goal of entering the top 30 most developed countries in the Strategy ‘Kazakhstan 2050’, which are largely due to active participation in such integration organizations such as the European Union, the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and others, could take leading positions. So for us, in the light of the ambitious challenges facing the country, economic integration is imperative of our time, a vital necessity. Thus, the entry into the Eurasian Economic Union does not automatically solve all the problems of our economy. Integration primarily creates conditions for the growth of goods and services, as always says the President.

There are a lot of advantages in entering into a common economic space with Russia and Belarus. Only state procurement of partner countries are 198 billion dollars, it is 26 times more than Kazakhstan realities, value of imports increased by more than a half.
