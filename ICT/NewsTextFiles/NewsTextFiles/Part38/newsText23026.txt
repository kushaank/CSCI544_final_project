
The announcement was probably spurred by the arrival of the Saudi Ambassador to Lebanon Ali Awad Assiri who returned to the Beirut with his family on May 2.

UAE citizens and other Gulf nationals who are missing the glitz and glam of Lebanon may well return to the troubled country this summer after indications that tensions are finally easing here.

Beirut normally sees a huge influx of wealthy holiday makers from UAE, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in May but in the last two years none have come due to fears of kidnapping. However, Saudi Arabia has given its citizens the green light for Lebanon, as a travel ban from its government is soon to be lifted, according to Lebanese state media.

“Saudi Arabia is inclined to lift the travel ban to Lebanon at the end of May,” Lebanese state broadcaster LBCI said on Tuesday.

Assiri abruptly left Lebanon last September because “of the deteriorating security conditions,” he was reported as saying at the time when his kingdom issued a warning which euphemistically cited “the region’s current conditions” as a reason for the travel ban.

Since then a number of measures have been adopted by the Lebanese government which was rather slow at clamping down on a security plan, which, so far, seems to be working – paving the way for a summer holiday period renown for its private beach resorts and nightclubs in the capital.  The Saudi diplomat said upon his arrival in Beirut that there is no ban on visits by Saudi nationals to Lebanon.

“King Abdullah is keen on (the safety of) Saudi citizens, and the travel warning was only issued when (certain security) conditions prevailed in the country,” he said.

The tourism sector is an important factor within the Lebanese economy, which was brought to its knees in 2012, when the Syrian war started to really impact this tiny country.

The previous year of 2011 saw the Lebanese tourism sector grow by about 20 per cent with revenues reaching just over $8 billion.
