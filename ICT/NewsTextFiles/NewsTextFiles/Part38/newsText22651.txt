
Radical lawmakers Raymond Wong Yuk-man and Albert Chan Wai-yip plan to appeal to the top court against their protest convictions to ease the fears of those who intend to take part in the Occupy Central movement.

Wong said if they win their case in the Court of Final Appeal, those taking part in the Occupy protest would worry less about criminal convictions.

The decision to appeal came after a High Court judge reduced the sentence of "Mad Dog"  Wong and People Power's Chan for their roles in the July 1 protest three years ago.

Both had earlier been given suspended sentences and fines for illegal assembly and assisting in organizing an illegal assembly.

In dismissing the suspended jail terms, judge Derek Pang Wai-cheong said the sentence was too heavy in view of the nature of the offense.

Justice Pang said the magistrate Joseph To Ho- shing had overestimated the danger posed by the protesters as they slowly approached the police.

He fined them HK$4,800 instead on one of the   charges. Wong's other six charges remain in the original verdict.

Justice Pang said Chan originally planned to march to the government headquarters but later marched to Government House after discussion with the others. He said this could not be regarded as "organized" and believed the magistrate did not analyze the situation clearly.

Chan welcomed the judgment, but said he had an unfair trial as the magistrate had refused to grant him a recording of a previous trial.
