
Nicholas Sexton, one of two men accused of killing three people, testifies that he doesn’t like guns.

BANGOR – One of two men accused of killing three people and burning their bodies after a drug dispute blamed the killings on his co-defendant in his testimony Monday.

Nicholas Sexton of Warwick, Rhode Island, and Randall Daluz of Brockton, Massachusetts, shot and killed the three victims before setting them ablaze in a car in a Bangor parking lot in 2012, prosecutors said.

WZON-AM reported that Sexton testified Daluz shot Lucas Tuscano and Daniel Borders while driving near Orono and shot Nicolle Lugdon while parked on a dirt road in Hermon. Sexton also testified that Daluz ordered him to burn the car in Bangor.

Tuscano was from Bradford, Borders was from Hermon and Lugdon was from Eddington.

The station also reported that Sexton wept on the witness stand while describing Lugdon as a friend.

He said he went along with Daluz’s plan to burn the car because Daluz threatened him and his family if he didn’t do it.

Daluz’s defense attorneys said in court that Sexton called Daluz more than a dozen times in the day that followed the killings, indicating that he wasn’t scared of Daluz.

Sexton may return to the stand Tuesday, attorneys said.

Daluz’s defense team is expected to present its case after Sexton’s defense rests, possibly Tuesday. Closing arguments could follow Tuesday or Wednesday, prosecutors said.

Daluz and Sexton are charged with three counts of murder and one count of starting a fire. They each face a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted.

The trial opened May 1 at Penobscot Judicial Center in Bangor. The prosecution rested Friday.
