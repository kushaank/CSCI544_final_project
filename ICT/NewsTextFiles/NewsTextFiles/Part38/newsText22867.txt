
Local IHOP staff are adopting new food-safety standards recently issued by the corporate office, calling for everything from color-coded cutting boards to a computerized label program that figures expiration times and the proper storage temperature for a batch of pancake batter as it is mixed.

What they didn�t realize is the state of Illinois also has a new set of regulations that takes effect July 1 aimed at making dining out safer.

�I�m not aware of any change in the law,� said Gene Rupnik, who owns the two Springfield IHOP locations and has been a fixture of the local dining scene for decades.

The state�s new Food Handling Regulation Enforcement Act, passed last fall, calls for all restaurant employees to undergo basic training on how to prevent foodborne illnesses � something never required before in Illinois.

Previously, only one staff member on duty was required to have any training � in the form of the food service sanitation manager certificate. New regulations also have changed that requirement, eliminating a state-based test for a national version.

The previous 15-hour manager certification class for one employee is being replaced with eight hours of instruction required every five years for every employee.

Firm numbers reflecting how many people get sick from improperly handled food don�t exist since reporting isn�t mandatory, Lamb said.

However, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate one in six Americans suffer from a foodborne illness each year, resulting in 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths.

Across-the-board training is a change Ron and Janet Thomas of Safe Food Handlers have been advocating for years.

Their New Berlin-based business has offered courses for food service sanitation managers throughout the country for 25 years. More recently, they adopted an online curriculum for food handler training, targeting California and Florida, where such classes have been required for years.

The online class runs two to three hours and costs $9.95. In comparison, the manager certification course is offered downstate for $145.

Springfield restaurateur Augie Mrozowski estimated 90 percent of his staff already has state certification, which exempts them from taking the new food handler training. But the owner of Augie�s Front Burner and American Harvest Eatery said he dislikes the lack of communication to restaurant operators.

�It�s just frustrating how the rules keep changing,� said Mrozowski, who also was unaware of the upcoming changes in state law.

Allen Alexander, assistant director of environmental health for the county health department, said he�s not surprised by the lack of awareness. To date, the department has received only a handful of calls about the new rules, mostly from national chains or members of industry associations that keep an eye on legislative changes.

County officials plan to get the word out in an upcoming newsletter, but there are reasons they�ve dragged their feet.

The July 1 deadline is looming. But the particulars of how the new legislation is enacted are still being written.

The state health department�s Lamb said rules regarding the manager certification classes have completed the required public review and should be finalized next week. The legal process of public review on changes to the food handler classes and for instructor qualifications won�t be completed until well after the July 1 deadline, she said.

Enforcement, however, will be limited through Dec. 31 to informing businesses about the need for food handler training. The state office is working with local health departments on how violations will be handled after that date, Lamb said.

Then the state agency will turn its attention to applying the new legislation to food handlers in nonrestaurant settings, such as nursing homes and day care centers, which are required to be in compliance by July 1, 2016.

Either way, Rupnik said training about 100 staff members at Springfield�s two IHOP locations looks formidable. He�ll have until the 2016 deadline to train staff at his Microtel Inn & Suites, which serves a continental breakfast.
