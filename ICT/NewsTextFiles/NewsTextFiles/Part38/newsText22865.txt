
Union activists will today debate calls for co-ordinated industrial action, including strikes, by public sector workers over pay and spending cuts.

The annual conference of the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) will discuss the prospect of a one-day strike in July and a programme of further action.

The GMB union has already announced that its members working for local authorities will strike on July 10 if they vote in favour of action in protest at a 1% pay offer.

An emergency motion at the PCS conference in Brighton urges the union to press for joint co-ordinated industrial action across the public sector to challenge pay restraint.

Delegates will also be asked to approve consulting PCS members about a one-day strike in July and to urge the TUC to set up a working group of unions involved in disputes with the Government.

The coalition is facing opposition from several groups of workers, including teachers, firefighters, civil servants and NHS and council staff.
