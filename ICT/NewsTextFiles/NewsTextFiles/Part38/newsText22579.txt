Despite the Supreme Court granting interim bail for three weeks on Monday afternoon following the death of his mother, Tarun Tejpal, accused of raping his junior colleague in Tehelka, could not perform the final rites held at the city crematorium in the evening.

After completing the formalities for his release from the Sada sub-jail at Vasco, around 25 km from the city, Tejpal reached the crematorium an hour-and-a-half late. He paid tributes to his mother in front of the burning pyre.

Shakuntala, 89, died of cancer at the Moira house of Tejpal in north coastal Goa on Sunday evening. After waiting for his arrival, his younger brother Monty performed the final rites at 5.45 p.m.

Tejpal is now supposed to take the ashes to Haridwar on Tuesday for immersion, family sources said.
