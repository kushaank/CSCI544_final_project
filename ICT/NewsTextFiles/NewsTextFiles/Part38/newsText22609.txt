
Supporters of same-sex marriage hold photos of themselves and their family members or partners at a federal courthouse in Eugene, Ore., last week.

No sooner than the ruling was out, proponents of same-sex marriage said that marriage licenses were issued in Multnomah County, home to Portland.

Since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act last summer, not a single federal judge has ruled in favor of state same-sex marriage bans.

In February, the state's Democratic attorney general, Ellen Rosenblum, said she would not defend the ban in court.

In Oregon, proponents of same-sex marriage have also gathered enough signatures to place a measure on the ballot to overturn the ban if the courts did not accomplish that first.
