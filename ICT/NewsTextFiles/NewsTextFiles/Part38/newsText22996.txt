
A solar company based in Vermont is having success beyond growing its business - it is helping employees reduce their  carbon footprints by offering them a bonus when they do.

In an interview with Associated Press , he says his initial idea of charging his 31 employees a car tax didn't go over well, but after brainstorming together they came up with another plan.

Essentially the business has a carbon tax , which is charged against the potential bonus.

"Basically, you put a pot of money there, you subtract all the carbon-intensive stuff and they get the balance," Blittersdorf told Associated Press. "The less they do (in emitting carbon), the more money they have."

For a 20-mile commute in a car that gets 20 miles per gallon, an employee pays a $5.55 REWIRE tax, which is deducted from the $6000 bonus.

The formula: employees pay $0.15 for every kilowatt hour they use - since one gallon of gas equals about 37 kWh, that comes to $5.55 for that 20-mile commute. They add up the carbon use every year simply by checking the odometer.

Since REWIRE is in effect, there's been a big uptick in carpooling, bike-riding and taking the bus, and electricity use at home has dropped 21%. They can consume less energy by retrofitting their home, and getting heat and power from renewable energy.

Energy hogs end up without a bonus, but they don't owe  money if they exceed the $6000 in energy use.

So far, employees have collected about half of the $186,000 bonus pool, Blittersdorf told Associated Press.

AllEarth Renewables, which is expanding nationwide, ranks 148 on Inc. Magazine's 500 list for 2012 as one of the fastest growing companies in the US.  That year, revenues were $20 million. And it's among Vermont's "Best Places to Work."

Its dual-axis AllSun Tracker comes in sizes appropriate for both small residential and commercial-scale installations.  The tracker boosts energy production up to 45% over rooftop installations.
