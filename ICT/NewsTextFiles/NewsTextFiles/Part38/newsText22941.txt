
A report by the WorkCover Authority’s scheme actuary, Price Waterhouse Coopers, shows that the Coalition Government’s brutal 2012 cuts to workers compensation benefits were not required. The Coalition used a notional $4 billion deficit in the scheme as at December 2011 to make the case for the slashing of workers compensation benefits. However the PWC actuarial report tabled in a parliamentary committee this week shows that the scheme was not in a chronic deficit situation and was on track to return to surplus without the savage amendments pushed through in 2012.
