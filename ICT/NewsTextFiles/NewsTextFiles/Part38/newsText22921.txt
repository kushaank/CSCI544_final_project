A Fredericktown man was indicted on a murder charge today in the May 12 death of his 5-month-old son.

Michael A. Wingett, 24, is accused by a Knox County grand jury of beating to death Allen C. Conway.

An autopsy found that the infant had suffered blunt-force trauma to the head and torso, internal bleeding and bruised lungs; it also showed evidence of new and older rib fractures.

Prosecutor John Thatcher also said that the ligaments that attached the boy’s head to his torso were severed, which he said is consistent with shaken-baby syndrome.

“The amount of force required to cause these injuries would be similar to the forces involved in a car crash, if the baby had been unrestrained and hit by an air bag,” Thatcher said.

Wingett also is charged with inducing panic. He is accused of making a bomb threat to the Knox County Children Services offices last week.

Thatcher said that Wingett made the threat on Wednesday after learning that Children Services workers had taken another child, a 5-year-old, from Wingett’s custody.
