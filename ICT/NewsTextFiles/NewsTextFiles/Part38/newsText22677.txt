
Kenya: National Youth Council ( NYC ) wants Devolution Cabinet Secretary (CS)Â  Anne Waiguru to order a forensic audit of the Youth Enterprise Fund and make public how the money has been spent.

The council noted that fund was created to help unemployed youths, and any mismanagement in the board should be dealt with by the appropriate government institutions.

“We want the CS to order for a forensic audit of the accounts of the Youth Enterprise Development Fund. We demand to know if the money meant for the youths has actually benefitted them,” said NYC chair person Clement Ayungo.

The council said the Youth department must be restructured if the majority of young people are to benefit and create employment opportunities.

“The council continues to rally their support in the CS decision to restructure the youth industry and promises to work hand in hand with her. This is a department that must be restructured to conform to aspirations of the Jubilee Government of empowering the youths and women of this country,” said Ayungo.

They urged the political class not to ethnicise the youth sector but allow for competent Kenyans, irrespective of political and tribal affiliations, to head organisations. Clement Ayungo led Council also has called on the Government to conduct a balanced and transparent exercise in the upcoming recruitment of National Youth Service for the benefit of all Kenyans.

Ayungo accused the past leadership of carrying out skewed recruitment drives that largely secluded a section of the country.

With the undertaking to revamp and recruit a minimum of 20,000 youths every year, he lauded the move saying it will help propel youths to the centre of national prosperity.

“High level corruption and cartels have in the past denied youths from poor families access to the service. The Government should target youths from every corner of the country while considering gender balance in the next recruitment exercise,” he said.
