
Kenya: More than 165 senior officers vetted in March will know their fate on Friday when their employer releases the results.

The National Police Service Commission secretariat and vetting panels are to meet today at the Police Pavilion to start compiling the results.

On Friday, the officers of the ranks of Assistant Commissioner of Police and Senior Assistant Commissioner of Police will be briefed on their performance.

“There will be a press conference on Saturday on the officers’ performance. The law requires us to inform them first before we inform you,” said a senior officer aware of the programme who asked not to be named.

Commission chairman Johnston Kavuludi confirmed to The Standard they expect to release the results by the end of the week without elaborating.

Other sources said the commission is likely to ask almost 20 officers, who have attained the age of 55 and above, to take early retirement.
