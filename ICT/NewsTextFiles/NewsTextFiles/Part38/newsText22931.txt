
Just as the lock down from last week’s assault on a correctional officer was to be lifted, another staff member was assaulted by an offender at Iowa State Penitentiary today.

At approximately 7:15 a.m. today an ISP staff member gave a group of offenders a directive to move away from a restricted and off limits yard area. One offender began to argue with the staff member which resulted in the offender’s assault on staff.

Staff responded immediately and were successful in subduing the offender.

The staff member who was assaulted sustained bruises to his face and head during the incident.  He was immediately treated by health services staff and returned to his assignment shortly thereafter upon being cleared to return to duty.

ISP remains on restricted movement at this time.

Due to an ongoing investigation, additional information is not available at this time.
