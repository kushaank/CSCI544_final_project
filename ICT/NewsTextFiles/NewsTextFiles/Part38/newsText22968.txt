
Store and maintenance workers at six Canterbury hospitals will begin a 24 hour strike this week, after pay negotiations broke down.

The Engineering, Printing and Manufacturing Union says the pay of store and maintence workers is well below that of other workers.

EPMU organiser Ron Angel says 47 staff want a 5 percent pay rise, but Canterbury District Health Board has offered 0.85 percent.

Mr Angel says the strike will run from 6am Thursday until 6am Friday.
