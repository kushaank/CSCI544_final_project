The Ministry of Manpower (MoM) is conducting inspection drives across the country to regulate the job market.

It has also fined establishments that had hired expatriates for jobs reserved for nationals,' the release stated.

As part of this drive, the ministry has taken action against the violators like imposing fines, ordering deportation of expatriates and banning companies from hiring expatriate workers for one year.

Meanwhile, MoM's joint inspection team in Suwaiq, North Batinah, in coordination with the Directorate General of Agriculture and Livestock in North and South Batinah has arrested six workers from an unauthorised apiary. These workers were arrested for violating provisions of the Labour Law.
