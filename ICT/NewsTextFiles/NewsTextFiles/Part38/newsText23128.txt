
TRIPOLI, May 19 (KUNA) -- All UAE and Saudi Arabia diplomatic mission staff left Tripoli and heading to their respective countries after their embassies were shut down in a precautionary move until security situation improves, Libyan Foreign Ministry Spokesman said Monday.

Dr. Said Al-Aswad, in a statement to KUNA, affirmed the strong relationship between the Libyan interim government and the two Gulf governments, stressing that the staff departure was on a temporary basis and for their own safety due to the deteriorating security situation, noting that the embassies will open their doors as soon as the security situation improves.
