
With the Chief Minister-designate of residuary State of Andhra Pradesh N. Chandrababu Naidu unveiling his resolve for developing Seemandhra literally from the scratch, Seemandhra government employees have come forward to contribute for the reconstruction of their cash-strapped State.

Several employees in the Secretariat have warmed up to a proposal mooted by one of their colleagues to voluntarily contribute cash for the reconstruction of successor State of Andhra Pradesh. About 40 employees have signed up pledging between Rs. 5,000 and Rs.10,000 each.

K. Venkateswara Rao, Additional Secretary, Finance, was the first signatory to pledge the amount for reconstruction of Seemandhra. He says the idea is to donate the amount to Chief Ministerâ€™s Relief Fund under a special head for Seemandhra reconstruction.

There are about 2,000 Seemandhra employees in the Secretariat itself and others working in close to 180 heads of departments and directorates located in Hyderabad, who are expected to chip in.

Some employees said they expect the small initiative they have taken to grow big with public and NRIs too contributing for the cause of reconstruction of residuary Andhra Pradesh State.
