
Australia’s Joint Agency Coordination Centre said in a statement today that the Bluefin-21's carrier, ADV Ocean Shield, had arrived at Geraldton in Western Australia yesterday to begin preparations to receive the spare parts related to the transponder mounted on the vessel and on the mini-submarine.

The repairs are necessary to correct a hardware issue affecting the ability of the transponders to communicate with each other during a dive. The problem became apparent during Bluefin-21’s last mission on Tuesday, the search team said.

“The spare parts are expected to arrive in Geraldton later today, and once the replacement parts are installed, testing will be conducted at Geraldton prior to Ocean Shield transiting back to the search area,” JACC said.

The Bluefin-21 mini-submarine has been tasked with searching a 10 sq km patch of sea floor some 1,500km from Perth, where signals believed to be from the flight recorders of the missing MAS flight, were detected several times.

To date, the device had conducted 18 missions, but there had been no sign of any wreckage in the area.

The JACC also reported that Malaysian, Australian and Chinese authorities met over the weekend in Fremantle to discuss the bathymetric survey.

It was agreed that the Chinese survey ship Zhu Kezhen will conduct the bathymetric survey of the areas provided by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.

Zhu Kezhen is scheduled to sail for the survey area on Wednesday, if weather conditions are conducive.

Flight MH370 with 239 people disappeared in the early hours of March 8. Analysis of satellite data pinpointed the plane's final location to be somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean, although many experts and relatives of passengers have called for a rethink of the conclusion. – May 19, 2014.
