
Utah must recognize the marriages of over 1,300 same-sex couples performed in the 17-day window between a federal judge overruling the state's same-sex marriage ban and the U.S. Supreme Court staying his decision, a federal judge ruled today .

On December 20, 2013, Utah's same-sex marriage ban was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge, making same-sex marriage legal effective immediately. On January 6, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay on that decision, and same-sex marriage was illegal again (for now). Utah then decided that it would not recognize the marriages performed in that window (the federal government does ).

The State must demonstrate some state interest in divesting Plaintiffs of their already vested marriage rights. The State has failed to do so.

Kimball also ruled that the state would not get a stay of its decision pending an appeal, although: "the court grants the State a limited 21-day stay during which it may pursue an emergency motion to stay with the Tenth Circuit."
