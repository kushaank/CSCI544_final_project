Oregon could very well be the next state that tosses a ban on gay marriage, as a U.S. District judge is supposed to hand down a ruling on a challenge to the law Monday afternoon.

Other states that have tossed the prohibition based on constitutional challenges include Idaho, Oklahoma, Virginia, Michigan, Texas, Utah and Arkansas.

Oregon voters banned same-sex marriage in 2004, by a margin of 57 percent — shortly after a clerk in Multnomah County began issuing marriage licenses to gays, giving out certificates to about 3,000.

Meanwhile, Democratic Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum took it upon herself to stop enforcing the ban, saying the U.S. Supreme Court’s overturn of the federal Defense of Marriage Act made it pretty clear that any such laws were unconstitutional, The Associated Press reported.

Shortly after, four gay couples in Oregon took the ban to court, saying the law discriminates and is unconstitutional. They’re likely to win their case: The judge last week denied hearing arguments from the National Organization for Marriage on behalf of its members who favor traditional marriage, AP said.

Multnomah County officials say they will start granting same-sex marriage licenses as soon as the ruling in their favor is handed down, AP said.
