An employee at a local restaurant shot a patron Friday after an argument over a man, according to Gadsden Police reports.

Between 1:45 p.m. and 2:10 p.m., an 18-year-old woman was shot in the left wrist by an employee at Deja Vu Restaurant on Tuscaloosa Avenue. She was shot by a 28-year-old woman while struggling to get the gun from her.

The 18-year-old said the two had a prior disagreement about a man, but she thought that had been settled and went into Deja Vu. The two women got into an argument, according to the report, full of threats and insults.

At one point during the argument, the 28-year-old walked behind the counter and grabbed a handgun and pointed it at the 18-year-old, who then tried to grab the gun from the 28-year-old. The 18-year-old was shot in the left wrist during the struggle for control of the gun. The bullet traveled through her arm, entering and exiting at her wrist.

The 18-year-old also had bite marks, scratches, missing hair and bruises on her left arm and chest, according to the report, and she was taken to Gadsden Regional Medical Center by friends.

Gadsden Police Sgt. Patrick Chumley said no arrests have been made and police are still investigating the incident.
