SAUKVILLE, Wis. (AP) – Four of seven workers injured when a machine failed at a Saukville foundry and spilled molten metal remain hospitalized.

Police say the three others have been released from treatment. Authorities say the machine failure happened about 4 p.m. Monday at Johnson Brass & Machine Foundry. The injured workers were on a platform next to a large centrifuge that spins melted brass. The platform collapsed and molten brass was sprayed from the failed equipment, starting a small fire that was extinguished by foundry workers.

Two of the injured workers were taken by helicopter to the burn center at Columbia St. Mary’s Hospital. Two additional workers were taken by ambulance to the same facility.
