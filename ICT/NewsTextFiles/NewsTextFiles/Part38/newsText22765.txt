
JINDO, South Korea, May 19 (Yonhap) -- Rescuers resumed operations early Monday to search for 18 people still missing from last month's deadly ferry disaster amid weaker underwater currents.

After nearly a day of hiatus due to rough waters, Navy, Coast Guard and civilian divers restarted their job to find those still unaccounted for in the April 16 sinking of the ferry Sewol off the country's southwest coast.

So far, 286 out of an estimated 476 people on board the ill-fated 6,825-ton ship have been confirmed dead.

The start of a period of weaker currents at the shipwreck site has boosted expectations for progress, but concerns also have grown over a possible collapse of part of the hull, according to the state response team.

During a nationally televised address earlier in the day, President Park Geun-hye offered a fresh apology over the tragedy, unveiling a comprehensive plan on how to overhaul the national safety management system, including dismantling the Coast Guard.

The Coast Guard said it will "continue the search operation and do its best to find all missing people to the last one regardless of the government's structural reform."

   "The search for those missing will be continued," said the state response team representative Ko Myung-seok. "Some 122 divers are ready to comb a kitchen, compartments and hallways on the ferry."

   Family members of the missing showed outrage over Park's plan to abolish the maritime police agency, saying it could have a negative impact on the ongoing rescue operation.

Shortly after the address, they visited the county office of Jindo to lodge a protest with the minister of oceans and fisheries, who heads the government's crisis center.
