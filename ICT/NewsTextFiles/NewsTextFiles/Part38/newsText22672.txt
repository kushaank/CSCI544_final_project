
NAIROBI May 19 (Reuters) - The value of coffee sold at Kenya's auction jumped 24 percent to $83.5 million in the half-year to March, driven by improved global prices and better quality crop, a senior official said on Monday.

The east Africa nation, whose high-quality beans are sought by roasters to blend with beans from other producers, sold coffee worth $67.3 million in the first-half of the 2012/13 season that runs October to September.

"We had very impressive prices over the first-half and that reflected on the overall earnings. We anticipate this to carry on given the dynamics in the global market," Daniel Mbithi, the chief executive of the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said.

Kenya exports about 90 percent of its coffee through the exchange, and the remainder is sold growers to foreign buyers directly.

"The factors playing out on the global scene show the current high prices of coffee will hold for some time," Mbithi said.

Uncertainty over the performance of the crop in leading producer, Brazil following a prolonged drought, has helped prop up global prices of the commodity.

Forecasts of El Ni√±o weather conditions later this year have also lifted prices of the beans.

Officials said 324,247 60-kg bags were sold in the six months to March compared with 305,468 the previous year.
