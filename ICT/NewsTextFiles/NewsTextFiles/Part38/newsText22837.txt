
TEHRAN (FNA)- Several members of the Al-Qaeda-linked terrorist group, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), have posted a video message on the Internet threatening to topple the rulers of Persian Gulf Arab states, which happen to be the prime source of their arms and funds.

According to a Monday report published in al-Alamâ€™s Arabic news website, these ISIL elements, three of whom are natives of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, tore up their passports in front of the camera, Al-Alam reported.

The public threat issued by the three individuals came in reaction to recent laws declared by some Persian Gulf Arab states to block or restrict the return home of armed militants engaged in the insurgency war against the Syrian government.
