
Russia supports the idea of turning the Middle East into a zone rid of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery means, said Russian Deputy Defense Minister Anatoly Antonov. "A good idea has been proposed to turn the Middle East into a zone free from weapons of mass destruction. What is meant here is not only to rid this zone of weapons of mass destruction, but also to remove their delivery means. This is important," Antonov said in an interview with the Kuwaiti news agency Kuna.

Antonov also made a point that, "the countries of the Middle East should become signatories to all international conventions, such as the Treaty on the Nonproliferation Nuclear Weapons, the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological Weapons Convention. "Definitely, global security will benefit if all countries put their nuclear facilities under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency. All states without exception," Antonov said.

The Russian Defense Ministry would like all countries to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, he said "When this Treaty enters into effect we will raise a reliable barrier against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It will be a serious step towards nuclear disarmament," Antonov said.
