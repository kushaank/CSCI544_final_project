
KUWAIT: The Ministry of Education is studying proposals from five Arab speaking private schools to improve their status and thus increase their tuitions starting from the next academic year. The ministry wants to make sure that said schools meet the standards to be upgraded from Category B to Category A; standards that are related to the student density, buildings and teachers, said Dr Tariq Al-Shatti, the Assistant Undersecretary for Private Education. He further indicated that the ministry did not approve any school request to upgrade to Category A for six months, adding that work is currently underway to come up with a comprehensive mechanism to regulate the process.

Shatti made his statements at the sidelines of a year-end ceremony organized by the private education control for kindergarten and preliminary stage students. He commented on inquiries sparked by recent reports suggesting that a number of Arab schools submitted requests to transfer into bilingual schools amid concern regarding their qualification. “No permissions were given by the Private Education Department; which has sole responsibility to study and approve requests from Arab schools to transfer into bilingual schools,” Shatti said. He added as well that the department is studying the situation resulting from the shortage of Arab private schools in Kuwait, including ways to encourage investors who are often not interested in such ventures due to limited income.
