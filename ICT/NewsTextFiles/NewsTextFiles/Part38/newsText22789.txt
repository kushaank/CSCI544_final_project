
SEOUL — President Park Geun-hye of South Korea yesterday vowed to disband her country’s coast guard, saying that the nation owed “reform and a great transformation” to the hundreds of high school students who died in a ferry disaster last month.

Bowing deeply, Ms Park offered a “heartfelt apology” for having failed to prevent the sinking of the ferry Sewol on April 16 and for the coast guard’s bungling of rescue operations.

“The ultimate responsibility lies with me, the President,” she said.

Although she had apologised a few times over the sinking, Ms Park’s nationally televised speech yesterday was her clearest expression of public contrition.

As of yesterday, 286 people had been confirmed dead, with 18 missing, making the episode one of the country’s worst peacetime disasters. It has also developed into Ms Park’s biggest political crisis; over the weekend, the police detained more than 200 people who had tried to march on her office, calling on her to step down.

Ms Park’s public support has dropped to 46 per cent, from 70 per cent before the accident, according to a recent poll.

Ms Park said the coast guard had failed in its search and rescue duty.

“If it had tried to rescue people more swiftly and more actively right after the accident, it could have greatly reduced the casualties,” she said.

The duties of the coast guard will be absorbed into the national police force or into a new safety agency that Ms Park said she would create to ensure that disasters are handled better. The new agency will also incorporate disaster response duties currently scattered throughout various government agencies.
