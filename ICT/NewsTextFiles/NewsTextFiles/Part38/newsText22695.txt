
Mareeg.com- The spate of terror attacks in the capital has now forced the United Nations office in Nairobi to cut down on unofficial visits at its premises.

In a raft of security measures, the organization has also encouraged its staff members to work from home- where possible- to reduce congestion within its Gigiri complex.

In a communication to UN staff in Nairobi,  Director-General of UN office in Nairobi Sahle-Work Zewde said persons without official business with the United Nations office in Nairobi will not be allowed entry to the UN complex in Gigiri.

She directed managers and heads of agencies, funds and programmes  to introduce flexible work arrangements for staff. These arrangements include staggered working hours, telecommuting and compressed work week.

The measures are aimed at reducing the congestion along UN avenue that lead’s to the Gigiri complex.

Ms Zewde said the organization will only grant access to those with valid UN identification card and who are duly programmed for the pedestrian turnstiles within the UNON complex.

“The UN is not immune from these cowardly acts and we remain concerned about your safety and that of your family,” said Ms Zewde.

“All deliveries to the UNON complex should be carried out after working hours and between the hours of 1800 hours and 2200 hours. Deliveries should be announced beforehand and the registration number and names of the driver provided to the Security and Safety Service in advance,” the statement said.
