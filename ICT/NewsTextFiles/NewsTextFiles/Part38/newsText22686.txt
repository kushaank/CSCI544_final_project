
Mr Geoffrey Gitonga, an entrepreneur in the sector, said there has been growing demand for pasteurised milk from the dispensers, particularly in urban areas.

“We have been installing machines at strategic locations in urban centres and shopping malls. In the last two years, we have installed more than 40 dispensers. We have partnered with supermarkets and other shopkeepers as the demand for sterilised milk picks up,” he said.

Mr Gitonga told Business Beat he shares the profits equally with supermarkets and retailers as he is protected from other expenses such as rent, water and electricity.

He said the demand for milk from the machines is being dictated by changing dynamics in the local market, including the need for quality milk, depressed purchasing power and a surging population.

The prices for processed milk have increased since the introduction of VAT last September, which has prompted consumers to turn to raw milk. Currently, a litre of raw milk in most estates costs between Sh50 and Sh55, while a litre of processed milk averages Sh85.

The dispensing machines are digitised and sell pasteurised milk, providing an avenue for customers to get farm fresh produce at an affordable rate.

“We are selling one litre at Sh65, but a consumer can get as little as 77ml at a cost of Sh5. All one needs to do is key in the amount they require, and the product is dispensed,” Gitonga, who procures his machines from Italy, said.

Almost half of the milk produced in Kenya is sold in the informal market raw, and in several instances, it is contaminated with other components such as wheat flour or vegetable fats, putting consumers’ health at risk.
