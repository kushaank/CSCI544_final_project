
PROUD MOMENT: South Korean consul-general Yilho Pak hands Jack Hudson his Ambassador for Peace medal.

Painful memories came flooding back when Jack Hudson was honoured this month for his service in the Korean War.

The veteran says it still hurts when he thinks about the moment a friend was killed just a day before he was due to return home.

"We were watching a concert, we were all enjoying ourselves, and Johnny McGregor had to report back to fix a signal.

"He got into a jeep and a shell landed next to it and exploded. He was killed but that was the facts of war. It happened," the 83-year-old says.

Mr Hudson was awarded the Ambassador for Peace Medal from the South Korean Consulate during a ceremony at the South Auckland-based Papakura RSA last Wednesday.

He served as a gun-loader in the United Nations forces from 1952 to 1954.

"The night my friend was killed we fired 150 rounds from 24 guns. That's a lot of damage. We retreated in the end."

He was lucky to return home and marry his wife Leonie. They have three children, 15 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

New   Zealand military forces took part in a United Nations "police action" to repel Communist North Korea's invasion of its southern neighbour from June 25, 1950, to July 27, 1953, when an armistice was agreed.

A reduced presence remained in Korea in a garrison role until the last troops were finally withdrawn in 1957.

Consul-General Yilho Pak says South Korea now has peace and freedom.

"New Zealand veterans are true ambassadors of peace. Thank you for being a good friend of Korea,"he says.

John Taylor, Percy Manning, Alfred Miles, Alex Whaipu, James Smith, Colin Crooks and Ben Thomas were also awarded the medal.
