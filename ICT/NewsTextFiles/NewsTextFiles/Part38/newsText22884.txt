KATHMANDU: Nepali Congress (NC)-affiliated Nepal Students Union (NSU) and CPN-UML-affiliated All Nepal National Free Students Union (ANNFSU) have intensified campaigns for the Free Students Union (FSU) elections scheduled for June 1.

While the students unions affiliated to UCPN-Maoist, CPN-Maoist and other fringe parties are threatening to foil the elections to be held by the Tribhuvan University (TU) at its colleges, the unions of ruling parties have called all students to take part in the elections.

The UML-affiliated ANNFSU on Monday organised sit-ins at various campuses urging the campus authorities to conduct the elections as scheduled.

The union said in a press statement today "trying to halt elections in different pretexts is a conspiracy against the students' movement."

Likewise, the NSU is holding a mass assembly at the Shankar Dev Campus tomorrow morning.

NSU's Chief Secretary Shiva Rimal said chairs of all "pro-elections" unions including the ANNFSU will attend the assembly.
