
Forty-nine-year-old Richard Danz uprooted his family from Elk County, Pennsylvania to Matthews, North Carolina days after FBI agents searched his St. Marys in August 2012. St. Marys is about 100 miles northeast of Pittsburgh.

Danz was scheduled to be sentenced Monday afternoon by a federal judge in Erie.
