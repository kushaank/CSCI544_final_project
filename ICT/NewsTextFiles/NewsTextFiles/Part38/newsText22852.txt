
Commissioner of Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) M.V. Satyanarayana on Monday directed officials to demolish illegal constructions coming up in the city.

At a review meeting in his chamber, the Commissioner said that a number of complaints of illegal constructions were received from Zones 2, 3 and 4. He directed the Chief City Planner Venkatratnam to identify all such constructions immediately and take steps for their demolition. He also wanted the responsibility to be fixed on the field-level officers and staff of the Planning Wing, and charge memos issued to them.

Mr. Satyanarayana asked the officials of the Revenue, Town Planning, Engineering, Housing and UCD Wings to ensure transparency in administration and thereby eliminate the scope for complaints of corruption.

He said that it was identified in the past that outsourced employees working as ‘data entry operators’ in various wings were not having the requisite qualification and expertise. It was also found that though some of them did not have the requisite qualifications, they were found to be working with utmost dedication. At the same time, though some of them had the qualifications, they were not performing their duties well. He said that such non-performers should be identified and terminated from service.

Additional Commissioners G.V.V.S. Murthy and S.S. Varma, Chief Engineer B. Jayarami Reddy, Chief City Planner Venkatratnam, Financial Advisor Prasad Rao, Chief Medical Officer Satyanarayana Raju and UCD Project Director Panduranga Rao were among those who attended the review meeting.
