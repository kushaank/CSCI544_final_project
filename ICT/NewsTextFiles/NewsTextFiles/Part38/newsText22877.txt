
North West Premier Thandi Modise has expressed concern at reports that miners who are on chronic medication in the platinum belt are defaulting on Anti-Retroviral treatment due to acts of violence and intimidation that prohibit them from accessing health services at their workplaces.

"We appeal to workers on strike to be mindful that their colleagues on chronic medication for HIV-Aids, TB ,Hypertension and Diabetes need to access wellness care facilities for chronic medication that is life sustaining. Preventing them from accessing health facilities at their workplaces is putting their health at great risk," Premier Modise said.

Modise has urged workers to visit their nearest public health facilities to access their chronic medication, family planning support, prenatal care, Free TB and HIV/Aids testing and counseling.

She reiterated that ending the strike which has now entered into its 17th week will be the first step to avert possible job losses and restoring peace and stability as the protracted strike by AMCU has degenerated into a vicious cycle of violence that has resulted in the brutal killings of non-striking workers, destruction of private and public properties.

I thought there was pure oppression and exploitation only  ? Let AMCU come up with some health facilities !
