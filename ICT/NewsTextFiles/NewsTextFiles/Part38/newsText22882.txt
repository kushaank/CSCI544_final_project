
Mill jobs are expected to grow and contribute to an improving economy in a small Aroostook County town after nearly 100 jobs were created earlier this year.

The Presque Isle Star-Herald reported the addition of the Ecoshell mill in Ashland and reopening of the J.D. Irving Facility in Nashville Plantation led to the creation of almost 100 jobs this year.

The Ecoshel facility, expected to open sometime this summer, has hired 11 people, with plans to hire more in the future for production of its premium cedar shingle panels, Ashland Town Manager Ralph Dwyer told the newspaper. He said the J.D. Irving Facility has hired about 60 workers, with plans to launch in June. Dwyer said more jobs could be on the way once Jackman-based E.J. Carrier Inc. determines how it will move forward with its Ashland site.

"The biggest thing is they've brought jobs to the Ashland area.It will eventually boil down to an increased need for housing," Dwyer told the newspaper. "It helps local vendors, as workers gas up their vehicles, buy groceries and other goods. These companies' jobs are an answer to our economic problems."
