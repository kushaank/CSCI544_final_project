
ALL eyes will be on Lonmin this week to see who blinks first in the battle between the platinum miner and the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu).

Lonmin, the company worst hit by the longest strike on record in the platinum belt, reopened its mine on Wednesday after communicating its latest wage offer directly to employees and urging them to report for duty.

At least four people were killed this week in what police regard as strike-related violence. One victim, a 60-year-old man, was stabbed to death near Lonmin’s Saffi shaft early on Monday.

The union saw Lonmin as the weakest link because its operations were worst affected by the strike, he said.

While about 5,000 workers attended an Amcu rally at Wonderkop Stadium this week, vowing defiantly not to return to work, perspective was needed, said Minassian.

It is understood that about 30% of Amcu members reported for duty at various Amplats mines this week, up from 23.6% the week before.

Workers have also been returning to Lonmin, with some attending training and induction this week after it reopened its mine on Wednesday. It declined to disclose attendance levels.

Impala has extended paid leave for its nonstriking workers until May 25, and its mine remains closed.

“Tactically, the best alternative, if they have the resources to manage it, would be ... for the companies to wait another week or two for the workers to come trickling back,” said Albert Wöcke, associate professor at the Gordon Institute of Business Science.

He said intimidation would intensify until there was a critical mass of people who were returning to work.
