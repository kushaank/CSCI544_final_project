
Kenya: The Commission for the Implementation of the Constitution ( CIC ) has backed the reorganisation and restructuring of the Provincial Administration that handed county commissioners delegated executive power.

President Uhuru Kenyatta last week unveiled a new-look county administration to be headed by the county commissioners, replacing the old system of provincial administration, a decision that has been opposed strongly byÂ  the opposition.

The coalition has said that its leaders would not recognise the county commissioners, saying the law was violated regarding their empowerment.

ButÂ  CIC chairman Charles NyachaeÂ  criticised the opposition and accused it of being bent on frustratingÂ  the implementation of the Constitution. Politicians, he said, wereÂ  a threat to full realisation of the Constitution and could ultimately scuttle devolution.

He said the reorganisation of the Provincial Administration was important to ensure execution of national Government functions. Nyachae said those criticising the move were hypocritical.

“I am saddened that some of the country’s respected legal minds who were even involved in the crafting of the different functions assigned to each level of government have come out to make statements that appear to injure the spirit of the implementation of the Constitution,” Nyachae said singling out Siaya Senator James Orengo,Â  who has termed unconstitutional the move to rebrand the Provincial Administration.

Â Nyachae said President Kenyatta was within the law to appoint officers to help him implement national functions as provided for by the Constitution.

“I have seen people post on social media asking why I have not criticised the appointments, but really there is nothing to dismiss them for, they are within the law,” he added.
