Whether repairing 18th-century brick walls or running state-of-the-art medical equipment, about 1,300 employees are being recognized this spring for their long-time years of dedicated work at the University of Virginia. They’ve put in 10 or more years of service, tallied on a five-year basis, with one individual ­– Mary F. Hurtt, an accountant in the Department of Urology – surpassing 55 years.

Every spring, University Human Resources holds events to recognize employees marking their 10th, 15th or 20th year at U.Va. and another for those with 25-plus years. Altogether their time on Grounds amounts to 18,251 years of supporting students, faculty and staff in myriad ways; taking care of the Academical Village and other buildings; caring for patients; and fulfilling the University’s strategic plan.

The group in their 10th, 15th or 20th years, totaling 1,057 employees, was honored May 13 at a Service Awards Day reception in the John Paul Jones Arena , along with the 2014 Leonard W. Sandridge Outstanding Contribution Award winners . The festive event featured a red carpet welcome and popcorn and other treats before and after the ceremony. Each person’s name was called and the employee walked across the stage, then had a photo taken with the vice president heading their unit.

Employees with 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45 years, plus one with 56 years of service – a total of 239 staffers – will be saluted June 9, also at the arena, for their longtime efforts in creating excellence at the University every day.
