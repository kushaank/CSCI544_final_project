
ALLIANCE, Neb. (AP) - The National Weather Service says it has received several reports about tornadoes, funnel clouds and hail in the Nebraska Panhandle.

A storm chaser reported several funnel clouds or tornadoes around 6:30 p.m. Sunday in an open area seven miles north-northeast of Lake Minatare and later at Lake Kilpatrick in Box Butte County.   A weather service employee reported a tornado or funnel cloud a little after 6:30 p.m. about 15 miles northeast of Scottsbluff. A service employee also reported seeing hail up to 1.5 inches in diameter around 8 p.m., four miles north of Alliance.   It's unclear whether any of the reports were different sightings from the same storm.   A Box Butte County dispatcher said Monday morning that no injuries or damage have been reported.
