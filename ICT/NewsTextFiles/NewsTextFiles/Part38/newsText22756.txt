
South Korea's President Park Geun-hye has announced plans to break up the country's coastguard following last month's ferry disaster.

More than 300 people, many of them schoolchildren, died when the Sewol sank.

In a televised address, Ms Park formally apologised for the sinking and said that a new safety agency would now handle any rescue duties.
