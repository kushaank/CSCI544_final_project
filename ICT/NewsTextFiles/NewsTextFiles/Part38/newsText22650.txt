Yavapai County Attorney Sheila Polk decided not to accept the recommendation of an administrative law judge and stuck with her finding that Attorney General Tom Horne illegally coordinated with an independent campaign.

I don't think she should have done that. Not because she doesn't have an argument, but because of the peculiar procedural status of the case.

Horne is subject to an administratively-assessed fine, although the import of the decision is far greater than customarily handled by the administrative law process.

Arizona has a weird system of administrative law in this respect: While there are independent administrative law judges, their decisions are merely recommendations to agency heads, who can overturn them.

The decision of the agency head is the final administrative decision. An administrative decision can be appealed to Superior Court, but only on very narrow grounds. A superior court judge doesn't reconsider the case on the merits. Instead, the judge can overturn an administrative decision only on the basis that it was arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion or clearly contrary to the evidence or the law.

In Horne's case, Polk is the agency head and her decision is the final administrative decision. Horne is not entitled to an appeal of her decision on the merits.

That's not right. Anyone accused of wrongdoing should be entitled to a decision by an impartial adjudicator. In particular, a prosecutor shouldn't have the final word.

Lord knows, it's hard to work up any sympathy for Tom Horne these days. But in this matter, he's not getting a fair shake.
