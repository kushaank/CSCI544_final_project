
Wyndham Hotel Group, the world’s largest hotel company with approximately 7,500 hotels and part of Wyndham Worldwide Corporation recently announced plans to expand into Kenya after signing a franchise agreement for Ramada Nairobi, the first Wyndham Hotel Group property in the country.

Ramada Nairobi will be owned and managed by Global Hotels Management Africa Ltd. (GHMA), an affiliate of Global Hotels Management (GHM), which already operates the Ramada Hotel & Suites Ras Al Khaimah in the United Arab Emirates.

The agreement adds to Wyndham Hotel Group’s existing presence of Ramada and Hawthorn Suites by Wyndham hotels on the African continent in Ghana, Nigeria, Morocco and Tunisia.

The four-star hotel, projected to open at the end of this year, will offer 89 guest rooms including 25 suites and will be located on Wangapala Road, approximately 19 kilometres from the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and situated in the affluent Westlands area of the capital city.

Ramada Nairobi will include two meeting rooms and a rooftop banquet hall as well as various food and beverage outlets, including an all-day dining restaurant and speciality restaurants offering Chinese and Pakistani cuisine. Guests will have access to a spa, fitness room and indoor pool.

Guests staying at the hotel who are members of Wyndham Rewards, the free-to-join guest loyalty programme of Ramada and parent company Wyndham Hotel Group, will be able to earn valuable points, which may be redeemed for a wide variety of reward options including free hotel stays, air travel, gift cards for leading retailers and more.
