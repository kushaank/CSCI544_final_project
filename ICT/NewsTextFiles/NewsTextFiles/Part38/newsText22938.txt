
A man was shot to death in a Hialeah pharmacy Monday during an armed robbery attempt.

Investigators said Victor Navarro, 24, walked into 41 HealthMart, 820 E. 41st St., around 12:15 p.m. demanding Xanax. Navarro left and came back, lifting up his shirt to show a weapon, which turned out to be a BB gun.
