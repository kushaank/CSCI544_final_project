
Kenya: President Uhuru Kenyatta has taken on opposition leaders warning them that the State will not accept statements that may divide the country.

And the Head of State declared he had legitimate mandate to govern for a five-year term and those with alternative agenda should wait for elections.

Uhuru said that although the Constitution gives them right of expression, they should not resort to statements that are likely to create animosity and hatred among communities.

He recalled that Kenya had experienced its darkest days with the 2007-8 post-election violence, which he attributed to reckless statements by leaders that polarised the country along ethnic lines.

“We don’t want to go back to where we were in 2007-8 and you all know it’s careless statements from leaders, which took us there,” Uhuru said at Kikuyu town, after attending a thanksgiving service at the Alliance High School yesterday.

The President told off Senators Bonni Khalwale and Moses Wetang’ula who faced off with him on Saturday during a rally in Bungoma.

Uhuru scoffed at his critics saying the time for politicking is over and they should wait for five years to sell their alternative agenda to the people.

“They can say what they want to say but they should know I am the one ruling now and they can’t stop me from implementing my manifesto. I am telling them to wait for five years and come to the people, but in any case, they won’t even make it,” said the President .

“We have come a long way from the violence that rocked this country in 2008, which was caused by similar incitement, and we do not want to go back there” he said.

He said there is freedom of speech, but politicians should not incite Kenyans against each other.
