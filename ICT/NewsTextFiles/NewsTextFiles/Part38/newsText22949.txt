With the insurance industry facing a shortage of qualified workers due to an aging workforce, Southwest Virginia Community College is offering an insurance training program.

Southwestâ€™s goal is to provide programs of study that will provide entry-level knowledge of the insurance industry to fill the demand for customer service representatives, school officials said in a written announcement on the program.

According to a 2010 report by the National Alliance Research Academy, the average age of workers in the insurance industry is 56, resulting in thousands of jobs per year being available as this group moves into retirement.

To meet the needs of local and regional employers, the community college is offering a three-day Certified Professional Insurance Agent (CPIA) Success Seminar on May 20-22 from 8:30 a.m.-4:30 p.m.

The course is designed both for those wanting to jump-start a career or take it to the next level, with the CPIA professional designation.

The seminars address real-world sales and marketing, and will help students prepare for, implement and sustain a successful insurance career. The classes are CE-qualified, and come with a money-back guarantee.

The tjhree-day CPIA series is offered by the Professional Insurance Agents of Virginia and D.C., in partnership with the Center for Community, Workforce & Economic Solutions at Southwest Virginia Community College.
