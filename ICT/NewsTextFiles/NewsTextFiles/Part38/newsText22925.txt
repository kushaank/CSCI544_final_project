
A nursing home negligence case in New Jersey ended last week with a $13.2 million award to a former resident's family, lawyers have announced.

The case involved Mary Dwyer, who was admitted to the Alaris Health at Harborview facility in Jersey City for short-term rehabilitation after falling at home and dislocating a shoulder, according to plaintiffs' law firm Stark & Stark. Over the course of about three months, the 87-year-old Dwyer developed large Stage IV ulcers, lost 20 pounds, underwent nine wound debridements, two bone shavings and a colostomy — conditions and treatments that attorneys said were “unnecessary and preventable.” She died on Feb. 27, 2010.

Hundreds of Haborview workers went on strike for three days in 2010 to protest low wages, according to The Jersey Journal .
