
WASHINGTON (CBSDC/AP) — The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee hammered House Republicans over the Benghazi Select Committee.

Feinstein compared the Benghazi incident to the 1983 bombing at a U.S. Marine compound in Beirut that killed 241 U.S. service personnel.

Feinstein added that she believes all the questions have been answered as to the response by the Obama administration.

“Our report was bipartisan. And they were certainly answered to the satisfaction of the Intelligence Committee,” she told CNN.

The Obama administration and House Democrats are undecided about whether to take part in or boycott the investigation.

House Speaker John Boehner created a select committee to examine the response to the deadly assault on the U.S. diplomatic post in Libya. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., will head the investigation.

Boehner and other Republicans accuse the administration of misleading the American people after the attack to protect Obama in the final weeks of his re-election campaign, and of stonewalling congressional investigators ever since.
