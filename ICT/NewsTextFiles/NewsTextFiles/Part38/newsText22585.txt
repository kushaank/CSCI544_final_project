A federal judge has dismissed a $50 million lawsuit brought by members of the Ramapough Native American tribe against the makers of a movie that they said depicted their people in a negative light.

The 2013 movie stars Christian Bale as a man trying to find his missing brother, who has gotten involved with a bare-knuckle fighting ring in the mountains of New Jersey.

The movie's villain, played by Woody Harrelson, has the last name DeGroat, which is common among the Ramapough. Most of the 17 plaintiffs in the suit have the DeGroat last name.

The Record reports the judge recently dismissed the suit. That decision came a few weeks after lawyers for Relativity Media, which released the movie, and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss it.

In legal papers filed in March, they said the plaintiffs had failed to state a claim for defamation or false light under both the common law and the First Amendment and argued that the dismissal of the false light or defamation claims negates the claim of infliction of emotional distress.

Lydia Cotz, the attorney for the plaintiffs, told the newspaper that she and her clients haven't yet decided whether they will appeal the decision.

The Ramapough do not have federal recognition but identify themselves as an American ethnic group recognized as a tribe by New York and New Jersey.
