
BEIRUT: Saudi Ambassador to Libya Mohammad Mahmoud Al-Ali said that both his country’s embassy and consulate had “completely suspended their work [in Libya] Monday,” the Saudi News Agency reported.

Al-Ali said that the entire diplomatic mission left the Libyan capital of Tripoli for Riyadh in light of unstable security events taking place in Libya.

“We are in contact with the Libyan side regarding all the updates,” the envoy said, adding that the mission will come back once the situation in  Tripoli is stabilized.

The Saudi Embassy isn’t the first to be shuttered in the face of renewed fighting in the Libyan capital. On Saturday, Algeria also suspended its functions in the crisis-hit country, saying that the ongoing turmoil in  Libya posed threats to its diplomats in the country.
