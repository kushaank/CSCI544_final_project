
TALLAHASSEE — A federal jury in Tallahassee awarded $240,000 to a state health agency employee in her complaint of retaliation for reporting discrimination she experienced in the agency’s Pinellas County office.

Valerie Davis, a secretary and paralegal in the Agency for Health Care Administration’s Facilities Counsel’s Office in St. Petersburg, filed her lawsuit last year.

The agency administers the state’s $23 billion Medicaid program and oversees licensing of Florida’s 45,000 health care centers.

Jurors last week rejected her claim that she was discriminated against because of her race but found she was subjected to “materially adverse treatment” because she complained.

The award was for mental and emotional anguish resulting from the retaliation. Davis, who is black, claimed that one of her supervisors once wore a gas mask when Davis exited the office, for instance.

Davis, hired in 2011, said in her complaint that she was denied a promotion in favor of a white co-worker, whose evaluation had been retroactively improved from an “8” to “23” out of 25. Davis was later told to train the new hire.

Davis, the only black employee in her office, filed a grievance alleging race-based discrimination in 2010.

After she complained, her job performance evaluation was downgraded and she began receiving “curt, critical notes” from her supervising attorney, according to her lawsuit.

In mid-2011, the Florida Commission on Human Rights found probable cause that Davis had been discriminated and retaliated against, the suit said.

A spokeswoman for the agency declined comment Monday.

He expects the state next will ask for the award to be reduced or will seek a new trial before seeking an appeal. Davis was paid $27,573 in 2012, according to state payroll records.
