
RIYADH: Saudi Arabia closed its embassy in Tripoli on Monday and evacuated all its diplomats over â€œsecurity concernsâ€� in Libya.

Saudi Ambassador to Libya Mohammed Mahmud Al Ali told state news agency SPA that Riyadh had also closed its consulate in the north African country â€œdue to the current circumstances and the security situationâ€�.

He said all diplomats in Libya had been flown out of the country after a decision taken â€œin coordination with the Libyan sideâ€�.

â€œThe mission will reopen and the diplomats will return when the situation stabilises in the Libyan capital,â€� he said.

Libya has suffered a series of attacks on its leaders and foreign diplomats in increasingly lawlessness, three years after Nato-backed rebels ended a four-decade dictatorship.

Algeria announced on Friday that it had closed its embassy and consulate in Tripoli, citing a â€œreal and imminent threatâ€� to its diplomats.
