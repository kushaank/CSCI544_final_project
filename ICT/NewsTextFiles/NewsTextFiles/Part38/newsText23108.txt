
Libya edged closer to civil war last night as Islamist militias prepared to go  into battle against a secular rogue general and his supporters who attacked  the country’s parliament and vowed to remove them from power.

Nouri Abusahmain, the Islamist-leaning chief of parliament and Libya’s acting  commander-in-chief, ordered his supporters to mobilise in Tripoli after the  revolt by forces loyal to General Khalifa Hifter.

His call to arms sets the scene for a violent showdown in the capital between  rival militias, who were once fragmented but are rapidly coalescing into  Islamist and secular camps.
