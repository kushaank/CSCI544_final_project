Lauren Montgomery and her son, Finn Sanders, 4, spent Sunday night making boutonnieres with fresh flowers in hopes of Monday's decision to allow gay marriages.

The two were near the front of the line at the Melody Ballroom just after noon with their plastic bucket of flowers when the whoop went up from the crowd that Judge Michael McShane had struck down the ban on gay marriage.

"We've talked about daddies who love daddies and mommies who love mommies," said Montgomery, leaning against the Melody Ballroom as couples made their way over from receiving marriage licenses at Multnomah County.

Behind them in line were Zoe Sodja and Melissa Henry of Southeast Portland, who couldn't wait on Oregon and got married in Washington in September. They were out Monday to celebrate a friend's marriage at the ballroom.

"We're so happy to hear our marriage is recognized here," Sodja said, "and so happy to be able to celebrate our friends who can marry here."

Keep tabs on the people who represent your interests in Salem and Washington, D.C.
