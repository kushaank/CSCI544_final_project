
TRIPOLI: The libyan government on Monday proposed an initiative aimed at saving the country from plunging into civil war, calling on the disputed parliament to go into recess.

An open letter published on the government's website said the General National Congress should "take a recess after the vote on the 2014 budget and until new parliamentary elections" within three months so the country does not descend into civil war.

The budget vote had been expected to take place this week amid a dramatic spike in lawlessness in libya's two largest cities.

The government plea comes a day after the GNC was attacked by armed groups demanding its dissolution and after a retired general launched an offensive targeting Islamists in Benghazi on Friday.
