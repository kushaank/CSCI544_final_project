
Actress Pamela Anderson stunned guests at the launch of her charity foundation by detailing a catalogue of horrific sexual abuse during her childhood.

The shock revelation came as she unveiled The Pamela Anderson Foundation, which will focus on environmentalism and animal rights activism, in front of a crowd of more than 200 during the Cannes Film Festival in France on Friday.

She took to a podium to address revelers and spoke about how her deeply troubled past had prompted her love of nature.

Anderson has previously revealed she was raped when she was 12 years old, but she shocked the crowd by detailing a string of abusive incidents, alleging she was molested by a female babysitter at the age of 6 and gang-raped as a teen by a group of young men.

British fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood was on hand to support her friend, but admitted the revelations even came as a shock to her.
