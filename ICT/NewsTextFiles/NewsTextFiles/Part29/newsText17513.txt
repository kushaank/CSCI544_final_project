"The European Union observer mission is able to continue (its mission). However, it will have to make adjustments," Mario David, the head of the EU observer mission, reports  Agence France-Presse .

"All our equipment has been released from customs," David said, adding, "There were no more problems."

Mohammad Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood leader and Egypt's ex-president's ouster has led to  mass trials and death sentences of his sympathizers. More than 15,000 people have been arrested and at least a 1000 have been ordered to the gallows.

Morsi was Egypt's first democratically elected president.

The much awaited polls will see a face-off between former army chief Abdel Fattah Al Sisi and leftist politician Hamdeen Sabahi.  Sisi, who is a favorite for the presidential post, said in a  recent interview  with Sky News Arabia that he would improve the country's situation within two years and  would step down if people protested against him.
