
Kenya: Former President Daniel Moi has told the civil society to stop fanning instability in the country.

At the same time, the retired President has called on Kenyans to rally behind President Uhuru Kenyatta’s government.

Mr Moi said the civil society is only keen at antagonising the Government of the day without seeing the bigger picture.

He said Kenyans elected President Kenyatta and gave him the mandate to lead them and should be accorded the respect he deserves.

“The civil society is hell-bent on causing instability. They should know that the President was elected by Kenyans,” he said.

Moi wondered where the civil society groups got theirÂ  mandate to oppose everything the President does for the good of Kenyans.

Speaking to The Standard, Moi urged Kenyans of goodwill to rally behind President Kenyatta in the wake of challenges like terrorism, which call for the concerted effort of all Kenyans.

He said Kenyans need to support the efforts of their leaders in order to get solutions to the problems the country is facing.

Moi urged the civil society groups to be patriotic and part of the solution to challenges facing the country and not a hindrance.

“Some people cannot be criticising the Government year in year out. They should be part of the solution to the challenges we all face as Kenyans,” he said.
