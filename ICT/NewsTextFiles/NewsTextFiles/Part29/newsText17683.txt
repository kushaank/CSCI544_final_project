
New Delhi: Government has accepted a request made by Army Chief Gen Bikram Singh that he should be allowed to stay in official accommodation in Delhi Cantonment for one year after his retirement on July 31.

The request for the accommodation at 20, Mandir Marg in Delhi Cantonment area was made by the Army Chief's office more than a month ago much before the Government appointed Lt Gen Dalbir Singh Suhag as his successor, official sources said on Monday.

The bungalow is generally provided to a retired Army chief soon after his superannuation to ensure adequate security, they said.

Before Gen Bikram Singh, his predecessor Gen VK Singh had stayed there for one year after his retirement in May 2012.

The official residence of the serving Army chief is 7, Rajaji Marg in Lutyen's zone of the national capital.

In its last days, the UPA government has taken certain decisions related to present and future service chiefs.

The government decided that Lt Gen Suhag would replace Gen Bikram Singh after his retirement on July 31 despite stiff resistance from BJP on the issue.
