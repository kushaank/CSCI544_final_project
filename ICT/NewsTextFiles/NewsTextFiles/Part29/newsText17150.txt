
GLASGOW, Ky. (5/19/14) — The WKU Department of Communication hosted the John Lyne Speech contest, May 10.

This contest included selected students who were enrolled in COMM 145 and 161 classes. Tabatha Heller, a 2014 WKU graduate and Glasgow native, was chosen by her classmates to compete in the contest.

Heller, an interdisciplinary studies major, placed first in her section (COMM 145) out of nineteen students. “I was shocked. Even though I felt confident every time I did the speech that day, I was still shocked because there were lots of great speeches given that day,” says Heller. The topic of her speech was the importance of donating clothes and supplies to local schools. “It’s so important to choose a topic you’re passionate about (as I was with my topic) and to know your material,” comments Heller.

In addition to Heller placing first, Sydney Moad, a senior at Barren County High School and a WKU student, placed third in the John Lyne Speech Contest. Moad, who was taking COMM 145 as a WKU dual credit course, was the only high school student to compete. Moad spoke about the horrors of purchasing counterfeit goods.
