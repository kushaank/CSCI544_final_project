
House Republicans floated a proposal Monday to give schools the ability to opt out of program championed by First Lady Michelle Obama: healthy lunches.

“A temporary waiver would ease the burden on school meal programs, preventing more schools from dropping out of the National School Lunch Program altogether,” SNA president Leah Schmidt said in a statement.

About 30 million kids in the U.S. participate in the National School Lunch program daily,which provides free and reduced-cost lunches to needy kids, many of whom consume about half of their daily calories at school. But about 18% of U.S. kids and teens are obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . And while Congress and other groups support addressing childhood obesity by providing healthier food to kids, SNA says the standards have had an undue impact on financially strained schools.

“Since these standards took effect, more than one million fewer students choose school lunch each day, reducing revenue for school meal programs already struggling to manage the increased cost of preparing meals under the new standards,” Schmidt said.

Democrats on the committee have been generally supportive of the standards, and at least one sounded skeptical of the GOP proposal, calling it unnecessary.

The vast majority of schools were meeting the standards by 2013, though many faced challenges due to lack of equipment and issues with food cost, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts .

Bishop said he hopes the waiver provision does not make it to the final version of the appropriations bill. The House Appropriations subcommittee on Agriculture will consider the bill on Tuesday.
