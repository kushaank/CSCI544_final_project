
U.S. Army veteran Christopher Livesay will receive the keys to a mortgage-free house tomorrow in Fort Worth to honor his service overseas.

The homes were donated by Bank of America with help from the Military Warriors Support Foundation , a nonprofit organization that helps wounded veterans and their families as they transition from military to civilian lives.

Christopher Livesay recently retired after 21 years of military service, including combat tours in Afghanistan and Iraq with the Army Special Forces.

In 2003, doctors amputated one of his legs above the knee after Livesay was shot while serving in Iraq.

He is the recipient of two Bronze Stars, a Purple Heart, and the Meritorious Service Medal.

Bank of America has donated more than 1,000 properties to military families with housing needs since 2012.

The house key presentation for Christopher Livesay is at 11 a.m. Tuesday atÂ  9957 Peregrine Trail in Fort Worth.
