
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) - The influence of race on Little Rock neighborhoods will be the topic during a discussion at the Hillary Rodham Clinton Children's Library Monday evening.

Civil rights historian John A. Kirk and Jess Porter, a geography professor at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, host the Monday event.

Kirk and Porter are to discuss how Little Rock's neighborhoods became racially segregated prior to the 1957 Central High desegregation crisis and explore other influences on where people live. They are to explain how slum clearance, urban renewal, and other policies have enabled racial separation to continue.

The Monday event starts at 6 p.m. The library is at 4800 W. 10th Street.
