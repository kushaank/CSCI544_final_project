PONTIAC, Mich. (WJBK) - A three-year pilot program for a "balanced calendar" school year has been approved by the Pontiac Board of Education.

The new calendar will include a 25 day summer break instead of a 60 day one. The change is designed to give students more class time and eliminate the loss of learning over summer break.

A similar system in the Flint area has already doubled MEAP scores.

Kelley Williams, the superintendent of the Pontiac School District, is confident that will also happen in Pontiac and help turn around a city that's 51 million dollars in debt both financially and academically.

"Over 88 percent of our students are not performing at bench mark. Therefore, it's is a sense of urgency that we look at our system, we put in opportunities for students to be in a learning environment that will be conducive and supporting consistently across all levels that would increase academics," she says.

The district also received a grant to expand the technological "Chrome Program" to students in 7th - 12th grades.
