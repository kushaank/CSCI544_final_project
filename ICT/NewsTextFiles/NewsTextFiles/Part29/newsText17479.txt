
A university student who was caught with 20,000 Euros (£16,000) in her underwear on a flight to Turkey denied funding terrorism today.

Nawal Masaad, 26, of Holloway, north London, is accused of trying to smuggle the cash through Heathrow Airport en route to Syria.

She was recruited by mother-of-two Amal El-Wahabi, 27, to take the money to El-Wahabi's terrorist husband, it is claimed.

The cash, which was wrapped in clingfilm, was discovered when Masaad was searched at Heathrow airport on January 16 this year.

Both women pleaded not guilty to one count of becoming concerned in a funding arrangement when they appeared in court.

Miss Msaad has posted a statement on her Facebook page proclaiming her innocence and denying that she has any ‘jihadist affiliations’.

She said: ‘On 16th January 2014 I was arrested at Heathrow airport and accused of transporting money to Syria for the purposes of terrorism.

Yesterday, carrying what appeared to be a £3,500 quilted black Chanel bag and wearing stilettos, a blouse, and white mini-skirt and jacket, Miss Msaad arrived at the Old Bailey with her electronic ankle tag clearly on display.

In heavy make-up and aviator sunglasses, she was seen smiling as she left the building following her brief court appearance.

Both women are on conditional bail until their trial at the Old Bailey on 7 July this year.

Masaad and El-Wahabi, of northwest London, both deny becoming concerned in a funding arrangement as a result of   which money was made available or was to be made available to another, and they knew or had reasonable cause to suspect that it would or may be used for   the purposes of terrorism.

A Contempt of Court order bans publication of El-Wahabi's address other than 'northwest London'.
