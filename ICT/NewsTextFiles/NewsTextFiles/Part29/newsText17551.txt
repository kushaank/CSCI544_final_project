
It is, if you ask the host of Al-Tahrir television in Egypt.

In a video clip posted by the media translation service Middle East Media Research Institute, the host of an interview show on Al-Tahrir launches into a monologue in which she accuses the writers of the long-running US comedy of being “think tank” members acting at the behest of News Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch, “the most influential and dangerous man in the world.” News Corp. is the parent company of the Fox network, which has aired the Simpsons for more than two decades.

In a bizarre rant, the Egyptian television hostess accuses Murdoch of being a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood and that The Simpsons was nothing more than a front which is used to communicate political messages to the American public.

Anti-Semitism is in abundant supply in Egyptian media.
