
Miley Cyrus recently took to stage on May 9 in London to tell her fans that she is heartbroken. Though Cyrus did not take a specific name she did hint that she is speaking about her recent boyfriend. This lead to conjecture that Cyrus was speaking to her fans about "The Hunger Games" actor Liam Hemsworth, to whom she was once engaged.

"Miley's temper tantrum in London happened because Liam disappointed her again," a source revealed to Hollywoodlife, adding, "They were talking when she was back in LA, he visited her when she was sick and she was trying to make plans to come back to LA and see him and he shut her down. He felt bad but he's not into it. He wants to move on and she got angry."

Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth broke-up last year. Though the reason for the couple's break-up is unknown; it is being thought that Cyrus's outrageous MTV VMA's performance led to issues between the two.

Miley addressed the audience by saying that she had written "Wrecking Ball" for someone who broke her heart.

However, after her rant went rampant in media Miley took to Twitter to confirm that her comments, especially the G.A.Y comment was not meant for Liam.

"I don't usually respond to tabloid stuff but this isn't something I want being spread around. It sounded hateful but not what I meant. I never want hateful things being said about those I care about... I was just tooooo turnttttt," Miley tweeted on her official account.

Miley Cyrus will be next performing in Odyssey Arena in Belfast, UK.
