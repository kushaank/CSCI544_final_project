BRUSSELS--The European Union's election monitoring team in Cairo said on Monday it will now go ahead with nationwide oversight of the upcoming Egyptian presidential election.

On Saturday, the EU said it had canceled the Egypt-wide mission because it had been unable to send key monitoring equipment to its team in Cairo. At the time, the EU said it was "willing" to conduct a more limited oversight operation restricted just to Cairo.

However, a spokesman for the election monitoring team in Cairo said on Monday EU monitors will now deploy across Egypt for the vote, which is due later this month.

The EU had started deploying observers in the second half of April following an invitation by Egypt's authorities to oversee the vote. It has some 40 people on the ground at present in its team, officials say.

An EU official said Saturday that "unfortunately, for administrative reasons, despite our best efforts and repeated requests, it proved impossible to have the telecommunication equipment and medical kits essential to ensure the security and safety of observers released on time."

Former Army Chief Abdel Fattah Al Sisi is the favorite to win the election. He has pledged to complete a crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood if elected.
