administrative expenditures, and large increases in low-wage and/or contingent faculty labor – especially during the 1 percent recovery.

Kaler said the institute used “incorrect data to reach erroneous results,” and distorted his record as leader of the 52,000-student university.

Kaler has battled charges of administrative bloat since he took the job three years ago, and he says he has made aggressive efforts to trim fat.

Kaler was not on that top-nine list, but college presidents in North Dakota, Iowa and Michigan were. Kaler was No. 27 for highest-paid university presidents in the nation, according to the chronicle ranking.
