
Jamaica Inn star Sean Harris has insisted he has no idea what all the “mumble-gate” fuss was about.

“It doesn’t affect me as an actor,” he claimed as he addressed the furore which followed the BBC’s “incomprehensible” version of the Daphne du Maurier novel.

“It’s funny, isn’t it? I wasn’t really aware of it because I didn’t read anything,” he said.

Sean, 48, was talking backstage after collecting his best actor Bafta for his role as Stephen Morton in Channel 4 series Southcliffe.

Viewers complained about the combination of Joss’s strong Cornish accent and the actor’s mumbling.

Sean said the way he delivered the dialogue was “an acting choice” which fitted with the character.

“It’s well within the realms of that man’s world and who he is,” he said.

Host Graham Norton also poked fun at the situation, suggesting that the English teacher from Channel 4 documentary Educating Yorkshire should have been drafted in.

Sean also grew emotional at London’s Theatre Royal as he dedicated his win to the teacher who first saw his acting potential as a child.
