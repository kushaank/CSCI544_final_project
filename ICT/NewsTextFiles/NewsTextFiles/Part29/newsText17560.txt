
Egyptian expatriates began voting on Thursday, whereas the election will take place inside Egypt on May 26/27.

Over a quarter million Egyptians cast their ballots over four days of voting for expatriates in the presidential election, announced the Egyptian Foreign Ministry one day before expatriate voting ends.

"As of Sunday 2pm Cairo time, the number of Egyptians abroad who have cast their ballots has exceeded 250,000," Foreign Ministry spokesman Badr Abdel-Ati said in a brief press statement following up on the ongoing expatriate voting processions.

Egyptian expatriates began voting on Thursday, whereas the election will take place inside Egypt on May 26/27.

Two candidates are vying in the election, namely resigned army chief Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi and leftist politician and former presidential hopeful Hamdeen Sabahi.

Egypt's presidential elections are part of a three-step transitional roadmap announced with last July's ouster of president Mohamed Morsi by the army – led by al-Sisi at the time – following protests.

This will be the second time Egyptians cast ballots to elect a president since the 2011 ouster of autocrat Hosni Mubarak following the January 25 popular uprising. The previous elections - in which Sabahi came third - propelled Morsi to power in summer 2012.

The winner of the polls will take over from interim president Adly Mansour, who was installed by the army following Morsi’s removal.
