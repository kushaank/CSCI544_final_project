
A 52-year-old Norfolk man turned himself into detectives Sunday after police released a photo that City Councilman Danny Meeks took of a burglary suspect at the former Cradock High School.

Police charged Arthur L. Bellamy of Norfolk with burglary, grand larceny, felony destruction of property and assault.

Meeks' company, Cradock Properties LLC, is demolishing the school and building 200 houses on the site in the 4300 block of George Washington Highway.

Meeks said he and an employee were in the building Friday and saw that wires had been taken out and that the doors to the gymnasium, which previously had been screwed shut, were open.

He told the employee to call 911, and when he came around the corner, he encountered a man who raised a crow bar.

"I told him that's not necessary," Meeks said.

"You can walk out of here."

Meeks followed the man and told him, "I'm getting a picture so they can arrest you later."

Stainless steel sinks, copper piping and wiring and other metals were staged at the exit door to be removed from the building, police said.
