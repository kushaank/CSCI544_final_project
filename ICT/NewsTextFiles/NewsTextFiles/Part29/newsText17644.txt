
Don’t get too excited just yet “Fifty Shades” fans, but readers of E.L. James' popular erotica series are claiming that she's writing a fourth installment to the popular Christian Grey/Anastasia Steele love story.

On Sunday, James, 51, posted a close-up image of her keyboard without a caption or an explanation, which prompted some fans to speculate that she was hinting at a new novel by zooming in on the letters "F-I-F-T-Y." Despite James’ lack of confirmation, readers have since swarmed the British author’s Instagram page, begging her to confirm or deny whether she will be writing a fourth book to the best-selling “Fifty Shades of Grey” trilogy. Whether James purposefully zoomed in on the letters “F-I-F-T-Y” on her keyboard, many fans are hopefult that another "Fifty Shades" installment could be on the horizon.

“Fifty Shades of Grey,” an adult novel focused on the romance of BDSM-practicing billionaire Christian Grey and his virginal lover Anastasia Steele, was released in 2011. The series second installment, “Fifty Shades Darker,” was published the same year, with the series third and reportedly final installment, “Fifty Shades Freed," making its debut in 2012.

The silver screen adaptation of the series’ first book, “Fifty Shades of Grey,” is expected to hit U.S. theaters on Feb. 13, 2015. The Universal Pictures film, starring “Ben and Kate” actress Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele and “The Fall” actor Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey, released its first trailer containing some racy scenes in March at CinemaCon.
