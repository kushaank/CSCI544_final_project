
The ABCD parties in the Land of the Hornbills can be really confusing to the uninitiated.

Unless you are a keen observer of Sarawak politics, I bet you will not get the quiz 100% right.

Sarawak politics – just like in Sabah – is littered with an alphabet soup of political parties that non-Sarawakians find too confusing to follow.

That was why I was not surprised when friends tweeted, Whatsapp-ed and phoned excitedly – or worriedly, depending on political leaning – to ask what was happening in Sarawak on Thursday.

On that day, the shocking news that representatives from two Barisan Nasional component parties had ditched SUPP and SPDP to join Parti Tenaga Rakyat Sarawak (Teras) broke.

Many thought the political drama was similar to the Terengganu crisis.

In the Terengganu crisis, three Umno assemblymen, including former Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Ahmad Said, quit the party and declared themselves independents on Tuesday.

Their shocking move changed the political equation in Terengganu. It meant Barisan, the ruling state goÂ­Â­vernment, had 14 seats, Pakatan Rakyat 15 and independents three.

There was a possibility that the precarious Terengganu government would fall.

“Barisan to fall in Sarawak?” a rather excited pro-Opposition friend Whatsapp-ed.

His question revealed that he had not been following Sarawak politics.

If he had, he would have known that the SUPP rebels who quit the party were at loggerheads with party president Tan Sri Peter Chin.

However, the rebels led by Datuk Seri Wong Soon Koh, who is a state minister, are loyal to Barisan.

The same with the SPDP rebels led by Tan Sri William Mawan Ikom, who quit as party president. Mawan’s problem was not with Barisan but with his deputy Datuk Seri Tiong King Sing.

Tiong, the Bintulu MP, is a rather controversial figure. Google “Tiong and PKFZ” and you’ll get an idea.

I SMS-ed Datuk Peter Minos of PBB to get his take on the political storm in his state.

“Some people in SPDP pushed Mawan too hard and too far and that forced him to do what he did,” he replied.

“As for Wong Soon Koh, life was tough for him. Some people in SUPP seem to press him hard and do not welcome him with an open heart. Wong saw no way out,” Minos SMS-ed.

The dozen or so SPDP and SUPP rebels declared that they were “Barisan Plus” – aligned to the coalition but without being a coalition member party.

Teras leaders have said the party would formally apply to join Sarawak Barisan despite objections from its component parties.

“I think Sarawak Barisan has to accept them for obvious reasons,” said Minos, who is close to Sarawak Chief Minister Tan Sri Adenan Satem.

Teras’ acceptance into Sarawak Barisan will face hurdles. SPDP and SUPP will oppose its entry into the coalition. So will PRS (Parti Rakyat Sarawak), which until the “Teras Move”, was the second biggest Barisan component party in SaÂ­Â­raÂ­wak.

“All the while, we thought that what was going was the internal crisis of SPDP and SUPP,” said PRS secretary-general Datuk Wilfred Nissom.

“And they are roping in George Lagong (who left BN-friendly SWP), who is the assemblyman for Pelagus, which is a PRS seat.

“We see this as direct provocation as he (despite contesting against a BaÂ­Â­riÂ­san party) will be enjoying BaÂ­Â­risan facilities.

I called Universiti Malaysia SaÂ­rawak associate professor Dr Andrew Aeria for his take on the change in the Sarawak political landscape.

“Adenan is trying to get rid of Putrajaya-inclined politicians in SPDP and SUPP.

“He is hollowing out the parties so that he takes their assemblymen and MPs and basically leaves these parties bangkai bernyawa (empty shells),” he said.

Dr Aeria also sees the “Teras Move” as a betrayal of the voters.

“This reveals that these politicians are opportunists. They should resign from their seats as they were voted in not as individuals but because of the party they represented,” he said.

If you want to know the faces behind Sarawak’s alphabet-soup parties, my advice is to go for a political tour of Malaysia’s largest state.

The other thing is to listen to the political gossip among the politicians.

Sometimes you can predict how a politician will behave if you know his habit.

The views expressed are entirely the writer’s own.

You may think what you are sharing on WhatsApp is funny, but it can get you into legal problems.

Being moderate should also mean reclaiming our sense of humour, and not viewing everything through racial lenses.

For many Sabahans in Kuala Lumpur, without documents and a job, it looks like there is no end in sight to living on the streets.

Think twice before tweeting as what you post can be used against you.

Religion is intertwined in many families in Sabah and alienating any group will have serious implications in the general election.
