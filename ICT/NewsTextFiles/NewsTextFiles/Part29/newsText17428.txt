Now that a large amount of students at the University of Illinois have headed out of town for the summer, the amount of construction on campus will once again pick up.

More than 40 capital improvment projects are scheduled to get underway or will be completed before the fall semester begins in August.Â  Included is some work on main streets like Fourth Street from Kirby to Armory, Sixth Street from Gregory to Armory and Stadium Drive from Neil to Oak. You should avoid those areas if possible over the next few months.

UI Facilities and Services Support Engineer Roland White said the work on those roads will improve safety.

Meanwhile, facilities and services spokesman Steve Breitwieser said while there's construction throughout the school year, the summer is an important time.

Hear from Steve Breitwieser.

Breitwieser said one of the bigger projects scheduled to be completed this summer is the new Electrical and Computer Engineering building. The Natural History Building renovation will also get underway this summer.
