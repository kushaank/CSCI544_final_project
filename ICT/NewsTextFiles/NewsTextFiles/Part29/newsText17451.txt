
A BROMSGROVE student has launched a fund-raising mission to secure a 12-week volunteer placement in Zimbabwe helping young people.

Rosie Vass, of Kenyon close, who is hoping to fly out on June 9 needs to raise a total of £800 so she can show her commitment to ICS.

ICS is a UK government funded development programme which brings together 18 to 25-year-olds from all backgrounds to fight poverty in the UK and overseas.

Whilst on her placement the 23-year-old, who studies at Worcester University, will be working and helping young people whose lives have been affected by HIV and Aids.

Rosie said: “I can’t wait to go I’m really excited but nervous as well.

“I have always wanted to volunteer abroad but I have never been able to afford it.

To help Rosie on her cash-collecting quest visit www.justgiving.com/Rosie-Vass1 or text ROSV91 and the amount of your donation to 70070.
