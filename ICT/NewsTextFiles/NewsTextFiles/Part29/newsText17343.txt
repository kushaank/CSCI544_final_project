
The US government has  indicted five Chinese military officials for hacking Western companies and stealing their trade secrets—” the fruits of our labor ,” in the words of assistant US attorney John Carlin. The lawsuit is unprecedented  (pdf)—the first ever brought against individual members of a government for economic espionage via hacking. And, legally speaking, it’s pretty pointless.

Duncan Hollis, professor and associate dean at Temple University’s Beasley School of Law, says the move highlights the question of whether some types of cyberspying are worse than others—a touchy debate for Washington in the wake of Edward Snowden’s revelations about rampant US government spying.

Those alleged consequences include a litany of offenses ranging from “economic espionage” and to “aggravated identity theft.” Take, for example, the accusations against Wen Xinyu,  a.k.a. “WinXYHappy,” who stands accused of stealing a solar company’s internal financial data  and pilfering of network credentials for nearly  every employee at Allegheny Technologies Inc. , a US company involved in a 2012 trade dispute with a Chinese company.

Though these alleged attacks may, as US government officials implied, have cost American jobs, the push to define the relative degrees of cyberspying nefariousness might not be all that persuasive abroad, says Adam Segal, a senior fellow at Council on Foreign Relations.
