
The Egyptians reportedly came off a bus in the capital Kuwait City and raised pictures of the Egyptian presidential hopeful and their country’s flag amid fanfare and drum beating.

According to the sources, traffic policemen approached the bus driver and asked him and his passengers to show their identification documents, but they refused.

 “The policemen then called for backup support, particularly as more people joined the crowd, and more servicemen rushed to the area where they arrested 15 Egyptians and took them to the police station in Al Fatnass,” the daily reported on Monday.

The case was referred to the criminal investigation directorate and subsequently orders were issued to deport the 15 Egyptians.

Local reports said that the Egyptian embassy has been exerting “great efforts” to have the Kuwaiti authorities reverse the order and allow the Egyptians to stay in Kuwait after signing a pledge to abide by the rules. However, no statement has been issued.

“They were given a grace period of some days to prepare themselves to leave Kuwait for breaking the local laws and rules,” the sources said.

The northern Arabian Gulf emirate is home to slightly more than 2 million foreigners who make up two thirds of the total population. Egyptians constitute the largest Arab community in the country.

Around 260,000 expatriate Egyptians are estimated to have cast their ballots by Sunday afternoon.

The total expatriate turnout in the 2012 presidential elections was 311,875.

The presidential elections inside Egypt are scheduled for May 26 and 27.
