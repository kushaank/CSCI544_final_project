
Founded in 2000 with funding from convicted Wall Street felon Michael Milken, K12 Inc. has a great business model. Virtual schools cut out the expensive brick & mortar facilities and move the entire school online where students can point and click there way to a high school diploma. No schoolhouse means no light bill, no cafeteria, no janitors, and no gym teacher. Their overhead is a fraction of a neighborhood public school, but thanks to a loophole snuck into the same 2011 bill that cut funding for Texas public schools by $5.4 billion, virtual schools get funded at the same level.

Soon after, Williams issued a rule that essentially deregulated online virtual schools. According to an agency spokeswoman, the new rule “eliminate[d] the requirement for application to the agency to operate full-time online schools and eliminate enrollment caps.” Hindsight might be 20/20, but Williams’ decision to open the state treasury to a company with such a lousy track record both in the classroom and in the boardroom still doesn’t make sense.

Perhaps coincidentally, about two week before Perry announced Williams as his new education chief, Williams attended Andrea McWilliams’ 40th birthday party at a Sonoma winery, an event so lavish it made the society pages. McWilliams is also a lobbyist for K12 Inc. In political circles, her birthday party weekend in wine country is best remembered for not being disclosed on her ethics filing as required by state law because a handful of state lawmakers attended, including Sen. Dan Patrick and Rep. Jim Pitts, then the chairman of appropriations.
