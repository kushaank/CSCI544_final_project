ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) â€” About 300 people participated in a 5K race Sunday in honor of a slain University of Michigan medical student.

The Paul DeWolf Memorial Hero Run took place at Nichols Arboretum in Ann Arbor. DeWolf would have graduated this weekend. Participants paid a $17 to take part, and registration spots filled up days ahead of the event.

"This is just the sort of thing he would love," said DeWolf's father, Thom DeWolf. "Except he loved to run in cold and rainy weather."

"If he were here he'd finish the race and then come back around and find someone to walk with and encourage them through to the finish line," Thom DeWolf said.

Three men were charged in the July 23 death of DeWolf in his off-campus medical fraternity house in Ann Arbor, and one of them has pleaded guilty to second-degree murder.

DeWolf was a native of Schoolcraft in southwestern Michigan and a graduate of Grand Valley State University. The 25-year-old was attending medical school on an Air Force scholarship and held the rank of second lieutenant.
