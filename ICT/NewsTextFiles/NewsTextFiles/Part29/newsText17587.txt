
Speaking at a meeting with Ambassadors of Syria, Palestine, Tunisia and Egypt to Tehran on Sunday, Chairman of the Iranian Parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Commission Alaeddin Boroujerdi said that holding presidential elections in Syria is a significant victory for the Muslim nation.

Boroujerdi, who is also chairman of the parliament's friendship groups with the four countries, said that Syria will emerge as a stronger country than its present status once the crisis would end.

He pointed out that the Iranian nation and government have always stood by the Syrian people and will continue their support for them during the reconstruction period.
