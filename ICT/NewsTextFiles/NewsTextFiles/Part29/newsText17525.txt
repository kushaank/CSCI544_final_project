
An Egyptian court has acquitted 169  supporters of ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi over protest  violence last year, judicial sources say.

The army-installed government has rounded up thousands of  Morsi's supporters and put them on trial in mass hearings since his  ouster by the military in July last year.

The often speedy mass trials have jailed hundreds for lengthy  terms and even handed down death sentences, triggering  international outrage.

The 169 defendants were accused of taking part in 'riots' during  a violent protest in Cairo on August 14, when police killed  hundreds of Morsi supporters at two sit-ins in the capital.

A relentless crackdown on Morsi's mostly Islamist backers since  his ouster has killed more than 1400 people, and seen 15,000 others  jailed.
