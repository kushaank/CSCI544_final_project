ST. LOUIS - Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon calls part of the new school transfer bill unconstitutional.  Lawmakers passed it last week and the governor says it's at the top of his priority list.

"We're going to put that bill to the top because of the tight time frame," he said Monday at the groundbreaking of a new research facility at Danforth Plant Sciences Center.

He has until July 15 to decide whether to sign it, veto it, or do nothing. If he doesn't veto or sign it, the version lawmaker passed would become law.

The bill lowers tuition an unaccredited school gives to receiving schools. Parents would have to pay to transport their children to the new school.  The governor's biggest problem with the bill is sending children to private schools.

"It concerns me they want to experiment with the voucher system taking public money and give it to private schools. I'll give it at the top of the list. It's a pressing public policy issue I need to get to," he said.

Nixon said the voucher system is unconstitutional and went away in 1821. The Normandy school board wants the governor to veto the bill.

He says he also doesn't like the idea of teachers carrying guns to school. Lawmakers passed that last week as well.
