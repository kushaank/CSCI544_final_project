
Washington, DC. - Recently, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) issued another statement attempting to clarify its position on the Armenian Genocide, reported the Armenian Assembly of America (Assembly).

The most recent ADL statement comes in advance of Abraham Foxman's scheduled appearance at the Suffolk University Law School graduation on May 17. Suffolk University's choice of Foxman as the 2014 commencement speaker has stirred controversy within the school's student body, as well as from Armenian American organizations, who urged the university to reconsider.

“This is the beginning of a process to better understand if Mr. Foxman and the National ADL are sincere in turning towards a new and clear course on Armenian Genocide affirmation,” stated Assembly Board Member Anthony Barsamian. “As a graduate of Suffolk University Law School, this issue becomes ever more personal as the Armenian community of Massachusetts remains skeptical of Mr. Foxman's position on the Armenian Genocide and efforts in Congress. Actions speak louder than words, however, given the university's decision to proceed with Foxman, and the recent ADL statement, he now has a unique opportunity to address and make clear his organization's position on the Armenian Genocide,” Barsamian said.
