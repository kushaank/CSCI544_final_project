A Tumwater middle school student released pepper spray on a school bus Monday, sending the bus driver to the hospital, Washington State Patrol said.

The bus, carrying 46 students, was on its way to Mount St. Helens for a field trip when the pepper spray was set off.

The driver, a 28-year-old woman, began to have breathing problems and pulled off Interstate 5, south of Chehalis.

Medical personnel and troopers arrived at 9:30 a.m. and treated five students for exposure. The driver was taken to Providence Centralia Hospital  for additional treatment.

Washington State Patrol said the 13-year-old student who discharged the spray gave the container to a 12-year-old student to hide.

Three students were taken back to the school in Tumwater and released to school officials. The district sent a second school bus to retrieve the students who were able to continue on the field trip.

Washington State Patrol is continuing its investigation.
