
NEW YORK, May 19 (KUNA) -- A 12-person jury reached a guilty verdict on Monday against Abu Hamza Al-Masri who has been on trial for 11 terrorism-related charges. He could face life in prison.

The charges range from incitement, hatred, kidnappings of western tourists in Yemen in the late 1990s, to an attempt to establish a terror training camp in Oregon, US.

The Egyptian-born led a London mosque attended by convicted 9/11 plotter Zacarias Moussaoui and shoe bomber Richard Reid, before he was extradited to the US. He was indicted in the US in 2004.

The cleric, 56, born Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, denied all charges.

The guilty verdict comes three months after Osama bin Laden's son-in-law Sulaiman Abu Ghaith was also convicted on similar terror charges.

US Attorney General Eric Holder praised today's verdict which came less than a week of President Barack Obama's dedication of the National September 11 Memorial Museum to the nearly 3,000 people who lost their lives on that day.
