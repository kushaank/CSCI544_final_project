Clinical psychologist Nigel Latta believes parents need to stop overthinking and overcomplicating things when it comes to raising children.

Renowned for his politically incorrect television series, Nigel is visiting Papamoa Primary School tonight to talk about raising boys and girls.

Nigel will be reassuring parents they're doing a good job while telling them to stop worrying.

He believes the biggest thing on children's minds is how bumble bees fly and how to get their hands on another piece of chocolate – all while picking their noses.

“They are little human beings. So they're trying to figure out the world, their place in the world and how it all works.

Nigel's advice is not to overthink or complicate things, he says to have a few rules, stick to them, and be fair.

His trademark humour and encouragement seems to be working with parents. But on the other hand – his rules are not washing with the children.

“I get hate poems from children. I got a hate poem once from a 12-year-old in Gore,” Nigel jokes.

But Nigel isn't too worried.

Growing up in Oamaru, Nigel's father went to work as a builder, while his mother stayed at home looking after the children.

“At the time I just took it for granted that this was just childhood.

Becoming a psychologist wasn't Nigel's first choice of career, with his interest in studying people's minds and behaviour coming well after wanting to be an astronaut or a cowboy.

“It seemed like being a doctor you had to know too much actual stuff and I worked out that being a lawyer wasn't quite like what it looks like on the TV.

Nigel is at Papamoa Primary School hall from 7pm to 9.30pm.

Tickets cost $20, and $10 for Coast Kids families, and are available from Coast Kids or Papamoa Primary School.
