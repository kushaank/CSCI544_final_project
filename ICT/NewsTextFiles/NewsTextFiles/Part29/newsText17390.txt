
Jefferson City – The athlete and entertainers tax will remain in place.

House Speaker Pro Tem Denny Hoskins sponsored the enabling bill.

Hoskins said his bill continues the tax, which supports arts programs.

“This bill was an important step for protecting tourism in the state of Missouri. The Missouri Arts Council, Missouri Citizens for the Arts, Humanities Council, Missouri Library Association, Missouri Public Broadcasting, Missouri Historical Preservation, and the University of Central Missouri all voiced their support for this bill,” Hoskins stated.

• 60 percent to the Missouri Arts Council Trust Fund;

• 10 percent, Humanities Council Trust Fund;

• 10 percent, Missouri State Library Networking Fund;

• 10 percent, Missouri Public Television Broadcasting Corp. Special Fund and,

• 10 percent, Missouri Historic Preservation Revolving Fund.

The tax generated roughly $30 million in 2013.

If House Bill 1237 had failed, then the tax would have expired Dec. 31, 2015.

Other states collect the same tax from Missouri athletes and entertainers.

Regarding a special doubling of the tax when Manning plays against the Chiefs, Hoskins laughed.

No doubling allowed.
