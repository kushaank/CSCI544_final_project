
MOSCOW, May 19 (RAPSI) – An Egyptian court on Sunday sentenced 126 Muslim Brotherhood supporters to 10 years in prison each for assaulting police, damaging public property and inciting violence last summer.

According to Reuters, the Muslim Brotherhood supporters were found guilty of violence during riots in the city of Kafr el-Sheikh following the overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi. They allegedly chanted “Down with military rule” when Judge Hassan Fareed read out the sentences.

The Muslim Brotherhood moved into opposition after the Egyptian army, using public dissatisfaction with the Islamic rulers from the movement, ousted President Morsi in July 2013 after days of mass demonstrations by protesters demanding that he step down, and announced a transition period in the country.

In December 2013, the Egyptian cabinet declared the Brotherhood a terrorist group after an upsurge in attacks on the police and army following Morsi’s removal.

Morsi’s supporters held protest demonstrations demanding his reinstatement, which lead to riots and clashes with police that have claimed hundreds of lives.
