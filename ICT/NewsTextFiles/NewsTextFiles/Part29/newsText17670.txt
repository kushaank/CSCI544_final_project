In doing so, Mr. Bush helped illustrate how a president can be confronted by rapidly shifting events–and face them with the biting form of humor he was known for when he served as the 43rd president of the United States.

Mr. Bush said one of the most important qualities of presidential leadership is being able to “recognize what you don’t know” and take advice from experts.

Mr. Bush tapped Mr. Bernanke to chair his Council of Economic Advisers and in 2005 nominated him to become Fed leader. Mr. Bush said it was Mr. Bernanke who warned him that if decisive action was not taken, another Great Depression was in the offing.

Mr. Bernanke “was a sound thinker” and “cool under fire,” Mr. Bush said.

Mr. Bush also acknowledged some of the exotic issues he found himself confronted by at the start of the financial crisis. He related a time when he was advised of dire messages emerging from the TED spread.
