
West Pokot, Kenya: The Jubilee administration should facilitate county commissioners to be effective in discharging their duties, West Pokot County Governor Simon Kachapin has said.

Kachapin observed that President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directive which gives county commissioner’s more authority in carrying out their duties should be accompanied with allocation of enough resource.

The county chief observed that giving the county officials more powers without ensuring that they have all they need to discharge their mandate was an exercise in futility.

“What the officers need are resources. In some areas such as the rustling-prone parts of West Pokot, there are police posts which don’t even have a vehicle and are understaffed,” said Kachapin.

For those police posts with vehicles, he added, there was only provision for 15 litres of fuel per day which is not sufficient to cater for the security needs of such areas.

He also called on the national Government to upgrade infrastructure in schools to boost education standards across the country.

Kachapin said the education docket should be devolved so that county governments can be in charge of schools under their jurisdictions.

The former secondary school principal was speaking at the weekend during a fundraiser in aid of Paro Secondary School in Sigor constituency where he helped raise Sh1.1 million.

Meanwhile, a workers’ organisation in Eldoret wants Members of Uasin Gishu County Assembly to amend the Trade Licensing Bill.
