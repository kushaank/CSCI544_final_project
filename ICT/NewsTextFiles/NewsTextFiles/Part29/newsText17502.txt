
FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — 5 News reported that the University of Arkansas (UA) released on-board video last week that allegedly shows a UA Transit bus running a red light, hitting another vehicle and injuring the two people in the vehicle. This is the second crash this year involving a Razorback Transit bus, according to the news outlet.

The video shows bus driver Kari McCawley driving through a Fayetteville intersection before striking a car on the front right side of the bus on May 6. McCawley was ticketed on suspicion of careless driving and placed on paid administrative leave pending the results of an internal investigation by Razorback Transit.

In February, a seven-year-old boy was struck by a UA bus and suffered critical injuries. On-board video released by the university showed the driver was speeding, but was not cited by police.
