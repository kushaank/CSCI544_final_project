
NEW YORK, May 19 (Reuters) - Gordon Willis, the  cinematographer responsible for stirring camera work in such  film classics as the "Godfather" trilogy and several of Woody  Allen's best-known films, has died aged 82, Hollywood  publications reported on Sunday.

"This is a momentous loss," American Society of  Cinematographers President Richard Crudo told Deadline. "He was  one of the giants who absolutely changed the way movies looked."

Willis received an honorary lifetime achievement Oscar in  2010 and was nominated for best cinematography Academy Awards  for Allen's "Zelig" and "The Godfather: Part III."

But his work was credited with lending unique, often  stunning imagery to a roster of films ranging from the romance  "Manhattan" and lavish musical "Pennies From Heaven" to the  Watergate thriller "All the President's Men."

In thrillers such as Alan Pakula's "The Parallax View" and   "Klute," for which Jane Fonda won her first Oscar, Willis'  camera work evoked a dream-like, fugue state that critics  credited with elevating the films to the status of classics.

The Queens, New York-born Willis worked often with  "Godfather" director Francis Ford Coppola, Pakula and  especially, Allen, with whom he made eight films. His films with  Allen included the black-and-white "Manhattan," "Annie Hall,"  "The Purple Rose of Cairo," "Interiors," "Stardust Memories" and  "Broadway Danny Rose."
