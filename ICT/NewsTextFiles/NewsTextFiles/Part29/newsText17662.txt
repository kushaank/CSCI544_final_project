
Our company has been serving border security and law enforcement professionals for the past decade through our leading conferences, special events and trade shows. In keeping with our goals, we launched Border News Network to deliver border-related news from around the world electronically. I hope that you found our reporting valuable and informative. Regrettably, however, sustaining a global news service with unique content written by dedicated journalists throughout the world is resource-intensive and the commercial support necessary to sustain this effort has been lacking. Our standards are high and we intend, as always, to maintain them; therefore, rather than deliver an inferior product, we have made the decision to suspend publication of Border News Network at this time.  This decision is not irrevocable. Should the means and demand support resumption of publication in the future, we will certainly do so.

In the meantime, please visit our event websites . We look forward to seeing you at one of our leading border security events.
