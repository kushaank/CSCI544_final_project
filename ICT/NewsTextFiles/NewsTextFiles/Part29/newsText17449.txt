
Bloemfontein - The trial of a man accused of taking part in a rightwing coup plot will resume in the Free State High Court on Monday.

On Thursday, the State closed its case against treason accused Johan Prinsloo.

Prosecutor Torie Pretorius handed a list of admissions to the court the accused had made, in agreement with his legal counsel Johann Nel.

Prinsloo, 51, of Springs in Gauteng, faces charges of treason, conspiracy to take part in terrorist acts, and possession of illegal ammunition.

Prinsloo, Martin Keevy, 49, and Mark Trollip, 48, were arrested for an alleged plan to attack the ANC's Mangaung conference at the University of the Free State in Bloemfontein in December 2012.

Prinsloo allegedly attempted, between July 2012 and 16 December 2012, to overthrow the government by trying to obtain mortar bombs and other weapons to attack President Jacob Zuma and Cabinet ministers during the conference. He pleaded not guilty to all the charges.

Trollip pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy and was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment last year. Keevy was declared unfit to stand trial.
