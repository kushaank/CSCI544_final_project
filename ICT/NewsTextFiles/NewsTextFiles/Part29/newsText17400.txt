What was the response? Hubbard-Bert launched an investigation. The company removed the files from its server and worked with Google to remove the information from Google's servers. Hubbard-Bert is implementing enhanced security protocols for all of its web servers and is installing an offline web server for future testing purposes. All impacted individuals are being notified and offered a free year of identity theft protections services.
