
JINDO, South Korea, May 20 (Yonhap) -- Divers prepared to resume their search Tuesday for 17 people still missing in the Sewol ferry disaster amid hopes of weaker currents at the scene.

One more body was recovered from the sunken ferry on Monday, raising the death toll to 287 and lowering the number of those missing to 17.

The woman's body was found in a kitchen on the third deck, wearing a blue long-sleeved hooded shirt and khaki sweatpants, officials said.

Tuesday's search is expected to focus on the kitchen and the front part of the fourth and fifth decks. There could be progress in the operations if currents slow down as expected on the second day of a period of weaker currents, officials said.

Divers may use underwater cutters to break into parts of the vessel that are difficult to enter due to a weakening of the walls and a partial collapse of the hull, they said.

Rescue workers also planned to attach more wires to a new barge mobilized in the recovery efforts to fasten it tightly to its anchor chains.

Operations were suspended for hours on Monday after a wire connecting an anchor chain to a barge was found to be damaged.

Weather in the area was forecast to be cloudy in the morning, with about 5-30 millimeters of rain. Wind was forecast to blow at a speed of 5-10 meters per second, while waves were expected to reach between 0.5 and 1.5 meters high.

The 6,825-ton ferry Sewol sank off the southwestern island of Jindo on April 16, carrying an estimated 476 people on board. Most of those dead or missing were students from a high school near Seoul on a field trip to the southern resort island of Jeju.

The ferry, which departed from Incheon, west of Seoul, sank about two hours away from the resort island.
