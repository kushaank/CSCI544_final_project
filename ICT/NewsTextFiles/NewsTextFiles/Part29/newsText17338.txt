
Maselli said she didn't have a date for the Newington High School prom and thought maybe the Vice President of the United States might be available.

"Most girls invite their celebrity crushes and stuff and I don't have a celebrity crush," Maselli said. "But Joe Biden cracks me up so I thought he'd be a good person to ask."

She crafted an official invitation.

She even joked that if the VP rejected her request, "I have to invite (House) Speaker John Boehner and we can't have that now can we?"

Last September, she mailed the letter and waited.

"When I sent it, I thought there's no way it's going to get through to him," Maselli said. "No one is going to show this to him."

It turns out that Biden did get the letter. Eight months later, he ordered a special surprise from Kim's Flower Shop in Wethersfield for the occasion.

Kim Notaro, who is the owner of Kim's Flower Shop said he ordered "white roses and a red, white and blue ribbon."

"Dear Talia. Thank you for your lovely invitation to be your escort for your prom. I'm flattered, but my schedule will not permit me to be in Connecticut on Friday evening," the letter read.

"I would now like for you to be my guest to the West Wing as soon as you are available, if you're willing," Maselli said.

It didn't take her long to say yes to the man of many chuckles.

Talia said she plans to visit the West Wing in July, Right before she starts as a technical theatre major at Central Connecticut State University.

Sadly, Talia said she opted to skip the prom.
