
The sessions court, which is conducting the trial in actor Salman Khan's alleged hit and run case, on Monday examined two more witnesses who supported the prosecution's case of the actor visiting a bar in Juhu with his friends in September, 2002. However, none of them claimed that they saw the actor at the spot at the time of incident, or that he was under the influence of alcohol.

The prosecution first examined Malay Bagh, a bar tender at Rain bar, where the actor and his friends had visited around 11 pm. "I can identify Salman and he is present before the court. The actor was a regular customer. In September 2002, when the actor and his friends visited our bar, it was too crowded. They were standing at the bar counter, when my manager asked me to serve them drinks. I served them with Bacardi and 6-7 cocktails, along with food," said Bagh, while deposing before the court.

However, when the defence counsel examined the witness, he claimed it was implausible to confirm who exactly had consumed alcohol. "In 2002, when the actor visited the bar, the order for alcohol and food was placed by his friends and not Salman. However, the lights in the bar were too dim, hence one couldn't see what a person was consuming," said the witness.

Another witness, Laxman More, a police constable from the team who was on duty to provide protection to the actor's younger brother Sohail Khan, claimed that on the day, he was posted at Salman's residential building along with others. "At around 3 am, a man ran up to us saying that Salman had met with an accident nearby. I rushed to the spot with this man in his car but did not find Salman there. We waited for two to three minutes," the witness said while addressing the court.

The prosecution on Tuesday will examine the other two witnesses.

In September 2002, the actor allegedly rammed his Toyota Land Cruiser on pavement dwellers who were sleeping next to a bakery in suburban Bandra, killing one and injuring four others.
