HOUSTON (AP) — Houston police are investigating whether alcohol played a role in the death of a teen whose body was found in a hotel room after she attended her senior prom.

A coroner’s statement Monday says officials are trying to determine the cause and manner of death for 17-year-old Jacqueline Gomez.

Houston police on Saturday morning were notified by her boyfriend that Gomez was unresponsive in a room at the Hyatt North Houston. The couple on Friday night had attended prom at the hotel.

Police say the boyfriend told investigators that he and Gomez drank alcohol before falling asleep. Police have said they do not believe the boyfriend contributed to the girl’s death.

Gomez attended MacArthur High School in the Aldine Independent School District, where extra counselors were available Monday.
