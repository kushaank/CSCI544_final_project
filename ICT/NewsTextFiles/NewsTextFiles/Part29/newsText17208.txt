
Well, Reality Steve says that no matter how you feel about JJ right off the bat, you’re going to have a little bit of time to get to know him. The Stanford business school grad is smart, hot, and way quirky, which turns out to be Andi’s type — at least for a while.

According to the spoiler king, JJ doesn’t just survive the first night — and get the first rose — thanks to his pants gift to Andi, he actually does pretty well. Fans of the 6-foot-5 fella shouldn’t worry on Season 10 Episode 2, when JJ is one of the handful of guys who doesn’t get a date. The following week, in Santa Barbara, he’s rewarded for his patience with a 1-on-1 date. R.S. says the pair gets made up like old people and plays pranks on unwitting civilians.

Next, he hops the plane to Connecticut with a dozen other guys and hangs on the group date in Episode 4 . After another group date in Marseilles on Episode 5  (airing June 16), JJ once again rises to the top to scoop the Group Date Rose. But that’s the end of the road for the Williams College-educated guy, as he has to leave it all behind when Andi sends him home from Italy on Episode 6 (airing June 23).

It’s a bummer that things didn’t work out, but we’re not sweating it. After all, we have a feeling we could meet JJ at Burning Man this summer if we can score a ticket. Time to become besties with desert darling Lucy Aragon !
