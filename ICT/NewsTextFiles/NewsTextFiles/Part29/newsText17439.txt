
In 2011, US officials admitted they used a fake vaccination drive in Abbottabad, Pakistan as part of an effort to gather intelligence on the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden.  The attempt, to obtain DNA from vaccinated kids, didn’t collect any from the bin Laden children --so the operation was a failure.  But it did have a disastrous impact on other vaccination efforts in Pakistan and Afghanistan.  Since the news of the operation came out, polio vaccination workers have become Taliban targets.  A 2014 piece by the Council on Foreign Relations’ Laurie Garrett reported the toll on vaccine workers and the polio eradication effort worldwide.

"It is of course doubtful that many of those in infected communities would know of any constraint on US intelligence service use of vaccination programs, or that the knowledge would be sufficient to reverse a decision against vaccination in any particular case. However, the constraint could be advertised to local politicians and community leaders as part of vaccination campaigns, potentially reducing the risk of a boycott. Furthermore, the decision to vaccinate is made by many millions of parents every year, so there is scope for even a marginal shift in the decision calculus for or against vaccination at the individual level to impact many thousands of children worldwide, with knock-on impacts on a lower overall disease burden amongst those who remain unvaccinated."

In short, this policy change will only have impact if people know about it.

Both because the Administration should be applauded for doing the right thing, and because the world needs to know that happened, I hope this is news that spreads far and fast.
