The super PAC supporting Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes'campaign for U.S. Senate â€“ We Are Kentucky -- recently reported raising $32,500 in the first quarter of 2014. That brought the total raised since it formed last July to $293,000.

Despite the super PAC's name, less than 2 percent of the money it has raised has been given by groups or people listing Kentucky addresses, according to reports it has filed with the Federal Election Commission.

Such super PACs must operate independently of the candidates they support. And unlike the campaign committees of the candidates, a super PAC is permitted to raise contributions of unlimited amounts from people, corporations and labor unions. And so far, We Are Kentucky has received two huge contributions of $100,000 each from labor groups.

We Are Kentucky has yet to buy media advertising. But it has spent most of what it has raised, and as of April 1 reports only $108,336 in cash on hand.

It's major expenses to date, according to its FEC reports, have been: $103,039 to New Partners, of Washington, for strategic consulting and fundraising consulting; $27,943 in travel and other expense reimbursements paid to its treasurer William May;  $27,400 to Blue Labs, of Washington, for data services; $15,000 to Ross Offinger, of Brooklyn, for fundraising consulting; and $9,600 to Target Smart Communications, of Washington, for list purchase.

A super PAC supporting incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, Kentuckians for Strong Leadership, has reported raising a bit more than $3.3 million so far.
