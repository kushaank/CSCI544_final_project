
Nigerian women hold placards in front of the Nigerian High Commission May, 16, 2014. during a protest against the kidnapping of the Nigerian school girls by Islamist militant group Boko Haram,

The U.S. announced this week that  two dozen specialists are in Nigeria and American drones , along with piloted U.S. reconnaissance plane, will be flying over the country to help find the girls. Some have argued that the heavy use of the hashtag around the world put pressure on the Nigerian government to take additional action. But critics see the hashtag activism as a meaningless virtual protest.

At the height of the movement, Michelle Obama tweeted a picture of her holding a sign with the hashtag, saying “our prayers are with the missing Nigerian girls and their families.” Other prominent figures also tweeted pictures of support.

That drew praise, but also came in for criticism. Thanks to Photoshop, the sign was altered to criticize the Obama administration’s use of drones in the Middle East, many changing the hashtag to #BringBackYourDrones.

Commenting on the hashtag phenomenon, Pioneer Press political cartoonist Eric Allie depicted the 1964 crime that spurred the term “bystander effect,” the murder of Kitty Genovese in New York, where many people watched the crime happen but did nothing to assist. Except this time, they hashtagged their concerns.

The movement was the topic of  “Fox News Sunday” where George Will criticized the movement , saying the hashtag wouldn’t have any effect on the real world. He said: “Are these barbarians in the wilds of Nigeria supposed to check their Twitter accounts and say, ‘Uh oh, Michelle Obama is very cross with us, we better change our behavior’?” Conservative commentator Ann Coulter offered her own criticism of the movement. She changed the hashtag altogether, holding a sign of her own that said #BringBackOurCountry.

In turn, her photo was quickly altered in various ways.

How hateful to change the sign the First Lady is holding.

#HashTag for one particular event cannot minimize the effect of tag phenomena. Remember that those same #HashTag revolutionized the many countries during the Arab Spring. Arab Spring was a product of #HashTag. #BringBackOurGirls should not make who ever express it ignorant. I am replying to those who are against please read several journals and think before you comment.

We had a near miss with the minature mind of a Sarah Palin as president. Thanks, John McCain. See what  pandering gets you.

This crony with her dishonest blather on the day’s buzz, so smug and instrusive. Her less than superficial understanding forever entitles her as the Cliff Notes version of the republican political careerist.

Palin’s effort at being chummy and always accessible and her counterfeit dissembling is a waste of anyone’s time.

And just what did Sarah do to bring the girls back? I guess people talking about it is something better than doing nothing. The government is already sending people over there. Sarah Palin talks about everyone but her own disfunctional  life.
