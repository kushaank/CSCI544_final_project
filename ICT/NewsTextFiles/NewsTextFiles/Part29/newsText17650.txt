Soon-to-be newlyweds Christie Connolly, 25, and Sam Holland, 28, were all set to tie the knot at City Hall in the Welsh capital of Cardiff this September.

But they've now been ordered out — because the POTUS needs the room for a banquet for NATO leaders.

Luckily, City Hall staff stepped in to offer them use of the nearby Lord Mayor's Mansion House for their big day instead.

Despite losing out their first choice locale, the pair insists there are "no hard feelings."

"I got a letter saying City Hall would be inaccessible. I nearly fainted," a shocked Connolly told Wales Online.

"I thought: 'We haven't got the money to make new plans, and it's a little bit late as we've already booked stuff,'" she added.

They've even invited the President and First Lady over to help them celebrate their nuptials.

"I emailed the White House saying, 'You, your wife and your secret service guys are welcome to come down for a bit of cake!'" Connolly said.

"And if he wants to pay for the wedding off the back of it, well I'm more than happy!" she cheekily added.
