
A Warren teen wearing latex gloves was arrested early Sunday morning after police said he burglarized Ferndale High School.

The boy, 15, ran from the building at 881 Pinecrest, shortly after an alarm alerted police to the burglary about 3 a.m., said Ferndale Police Lt. William Wilson.

He had stolen a camera and some candy from inside the school, Wilson added.

Police from four cities responded to the alarm.

Police said they saw the teen as he ran, but chased him down and arrested him.

Wilson said when officers first arrived at the high school they spotted a second-story window open. On the ground in back of the school police found a bicycle and footprints in the grass leading to a pillar.

�We believe the suspect climbed up the pillar to a second-story ledge and got inside the school through the window,� Wilson said.

The teen is being held at Children�s Village, a detention center for juvenile offenders, and is expected to be charged Monday afternoon.
