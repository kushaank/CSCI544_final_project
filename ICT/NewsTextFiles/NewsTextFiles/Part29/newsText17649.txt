
Mumbai: With Narendra Modi led BJP winning with a majority in the Lok Sabha Elections, number of Bollywood celebrities took to Twitter so as to congratulate the PM-to-be. Amidst all, an outrage was created over Twitter after a fake tweet on King Khan Shahrukh Khan's official page read that the actor will leave India forever if Narendra Modi becomes the Prime Minister of the country.

The tweet read, "It's my challenge to entire world that if @narendramodi ji will become next PM then I shall not only leave twitter but India also forever."

Calling it fake and foiling the tweet, SRK himself tweeted within hours, "Good time to tell all fools who r talking of a tweet that I didn't tweet, u suck as much as the grammar of that fake tweet & I'm being kind."

A picture of the same tweet was posted by Kamaal R Khan and it looked that Shahrukh got miffed with it and thereby wrote over the micro-blogging site, expressing his anger.

Well, this was not enough, as KRK posted some pictures with tweets from SRK's friends Aamir Khan and Salman Khan which also read somewhat the same messages. One of them posted from Aamir's official page read, "Will Leave India and Go To Pakistan and Settle There If @narendramodi Will Become PM."

Well, KRK though you have left India and gone to Dubai you have earned the enmity of all the three Khans.
