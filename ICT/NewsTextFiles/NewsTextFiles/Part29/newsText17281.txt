
Lagos – A renowned Nollywood actress, Joke Silva, on Monday called on Nigerians to join in the fight against terrorism in the country.

Silva made the call at a Freedom Walk in Lagos organised in solidarity with the secondary school girls who were abducted from their school in Chibok, Borno on April 14.

“What this is, is a call for each and every single Nigerian to understand that it is not only the leadership that is in-charge of our nation, the followership as well.

“A community fails when its members keep quiet in the face of tyranny,“ she stated.

A popular comedian AY (Ayo Makun), who also participated in the march, urged Nigerians to pray for the safety of the abducted girls.

“We are here to pray as a nation because what we need is prayers; and it’s something that everybody should be a part of because we need to see our girls; they need to bring back our girls,“ he said.

Another Nollywood actress Ufoma Ejenobor, who commended the military, however, urged them to do more in tackling terrorism.

“At this point I’d like to say kudos. I think our military are doing well, I think they are trying, we are just asking that maybe they try a different tactics.
