
NEW YORK (AP) â€” An Egyptian Islamic preacher brought to the United States on charges that he supported terrorism around the world from his perch at a London mosque has been found guilty.

Jurors in federal court in New York City returned their verdict Monday in the case against Mustafa Kamel Mustafa.

The verdict came only weeks after another preacher who served as al-Qaida's spokesman immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks was convicted.

Prosecutors cited speeches and taped interviews to show that Mustafa conspired to aid terrorist organizations, including al-Qaida. Prosecutors say he aided kidnappers of 16 tourists in Yemen in 1998 and tried to build an al-Qaida training camp in Oregon in 1999.

Mustafa insisted during testimony that he never supported terrorists.
