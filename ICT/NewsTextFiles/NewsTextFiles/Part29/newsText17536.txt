The Amazing Grace of the title is the grace and the power to forgive their attackers and remain in Egypt to serve the country they love and the people they love."

Through its international network of missions Release International serves persecuted Christians in more than 30 countries around the world, by: supporting pastors and Christian prisoners, and their families; supplying Christian literature and Bibles; and working for justice.
