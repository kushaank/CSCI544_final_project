
Hassan Adam Hassan, brother of the activist who died in detention in Sudan’s Blue Nile state recently, said his brother was innocent and had no link with the Sudan People’s Liberation Army-North.

In an interview with Radio Tamazuj, Hassan his brother died in military custody in Dem Sa'ad area on 9 May, after he was arrested on 3 May by security agents in Fazugli along with three other young activists.

When asked about the reasons behind the arrest of his brother, the grieving brother pointed out that the National Congress Party-led government does not give reasons for detentions.

"They claim that the deceased was spying for the Sudan People’s Liberation Army-North — but they did not provide efficient evidence for their claims," he emphasized.

He echoed earlier allegations that Al Sadig was subjected to torture by the military intelligence in an underground cell.

He further revealed the three activists who were also arrested along with the deceased have been released after the local residents in Fazugli and Dem Sa'ad decided to protest for their release following the death of the political activist.

Abdurrahman Mohamed Nasser, Yusuf Jumaa Saed and Al Dou Nasser were also accused by the authorities of spying for the Sudan People’s Liberation Army-North, which is fighting the government in Blue Nile and South Kordofan states.

The released activists are reportedly in good health and currently with their relatives in Fazugli town.
