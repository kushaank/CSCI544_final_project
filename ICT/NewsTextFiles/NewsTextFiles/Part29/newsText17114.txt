
Former Baywatch star Pamela Anderson has told an audience at the Cannes Film Festival that she was raped when she was 12 and molested by a babysitter between the ages of 6 and 10.

Speaking at the launch of the Pamela Anderson Foundation, the 46-year-old also claimed she was gang raped by seven boys during High School.

"Despite loving parents, I was molested from age 6 - 10 by my female babysitter.

"I went to a friend's boyfriend's house and while she was busy the boyfriend's older brother decided he would teach me backgammon which lead into a back massage, which lead into rape.

"He was 25 years old and I was 12.

"My first boyfriend in grade 9 decided it would be funny to gang rape me with six of his friends.

"Needless to say I had a hard time trusting humans - I just wanted off this earth."
