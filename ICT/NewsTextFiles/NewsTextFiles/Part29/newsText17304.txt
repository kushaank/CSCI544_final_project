Once a week, it’s time for some after-school Girl Talk for immigrant girls in the Willmar schools.

Girl Talk, a program designed to help girls prepare for successful futures, has a group of 15 girls at Willmar Middle School and another 15 at Willmar Senior High.

Recently, 10 Somali high school girls toured the Willmar Public Library with the program.
