
FRAMINGHAM - It was an historic day for Framingham State University Sunday.

Not just for the 972 students who received their undergraduate degrees but for the school itself, which celebrated 175 years by honoring its founder, Horace Mann.

Framingham State was founded in 1839 as the first public college dedicated to education teachers. Mann, the state�s first secretary of education, had only three students at his college, which was located in Lexington at the time. As the number of students grew, the location changed, finally settling in Framingham in 1853.

The school�s history came full circle on Sunday as�state Secretary of Education, Matthew Malone, gave the keynote address.

In a surprising twist, Malone used a famous pop icon to embody Mann's legacy in his speech.

Malone advised that like Timberlake, the graduates would have to constantly learn new skills and reinvent themselves. He said Timberlake�s �innovative and cool� style is something the grads should strive for.

�He�s like the modern day Renaissance man,� said Malone, commenting on the star�s transformations from a member of boy band N�Sync to acting to being a five-time host on Saturday Night Live.

He also drew on his own difficulties in school growing up. He had dyslexia and attended three different high schools before graduating.

�I should not be secretary of education for the best schools in the country,� said Malone.

He also shared an anecdote about his time as school superintendent in Swampscott. Malone worked with a student who could not pass the MCAS and had severe anger problems. Malone said he never gave up on that student, whom he called Antoine. The student passed the MCAS and graduated a few years later.

Antoine was shot�soon after,�and his death got Malone fired up about education, he said.

He encouraged the grads to do the same.

�Don�t ever be scared. Wear your passion as a suit of armor,� he said.

Malone was awarded an honorary doctor of education degree after his speech, which was received by a standing ovation. The school also posthumously awarded Horace Mann an honorary doctorate.

More than 1,000 people gathered on the Framingham Green on Sunday to support their graduates. Every seat was occupied and people surrounded the graduation tent to watch the ceremony. The crowd was more than four deep in some places.

University President Robert Martin began the ceremony by instilling his faith in the graduates.

�I stand here with complete confidence that you are prepared for your future,� he said.
