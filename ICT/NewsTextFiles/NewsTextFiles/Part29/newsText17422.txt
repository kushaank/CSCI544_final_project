With the school year at the University of Minnesota over for the summer, Maple Grove Transit has suspended express bus service on Route 789.

Service from the Maple Grove Transit Center to the U will resume on Sept. 2 when classes for the fall term start for the 2014-15 school year, transit officials said.

In the meantime, for those taking summer courses or need bus service to the U, Maple Grove Transit still operates its other express runs from the northwest suburb to downtown Minneapolis . Riders can then transfer to a Metro Transit Route 3, 16 or 50 to get to the university without having to pay an additional fare.

Route 798 made two inbound trips on weekdays, leaving the Maple Grove Transit Cente at 7:01 and 8:01 a.m.  On the U campus, stops included Anderson Hall, Coffman Union and the intersection of Washington Avenue and Oak Street.

The route also made two outbound trips, leaving the U at 2:45 and 4:45 p.m. and traveled via I-94 to Maple Grove.  For details on other Maple Grove Transit routes and fares, see the agencies website .
