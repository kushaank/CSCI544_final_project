
ALEXANDRIA â€“ An Egyptian court on Monday upheld death penalties handed down earlier against two supporters of ousted president Mohamed Morsi who had been charged with committing murder.

The two men, Mahmoud Hassan and Abdullah al-Ahmadi, were convicted of throwing opponents from the roof of a building in the coastal city of Alexandria last July.

The court also jailed eight people for 15 years each, 35 people for ten years each, and one for seven years in connection with the murder.

The killing took place two days after the army unseated elected president Mohamed Morsi following massive protests against his one-year rule.

Egypt's army-backed authorities have since launched a wide-ranging crackdown on Morsi's supporters, including the embattled Muslim Brotherhood, since Morsi's ouster and imprisonment by the army last July.

Since then, thousands of the groups' members and sympathizers have been rounded up and convicted on multiple criminal charges, which they insist are politically motivated.
