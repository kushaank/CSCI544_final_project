
WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.— In her first public appearance since her dismissal from The New York Times, former executive editor Jill Abramson is speaking to the class of 2014 at Wake Forest University.

Abramson will address graduates Monday morning. The Times announced last week that she was being replaced by managing editor Dean Baquet.

Abramson was the first woman to hold the newspaper’s highest editorial position. She spent more than two years in the job. She joined the newspaper in 1997 after working for nearly a decade at The Wall Street Journal.

Publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. has denied media reports that Abramson’s dismissal had to do with complaints over unequal pay or the company’s treatment of women. Sulzberger cites Abramson’s newsroom management style.

Ceremonies at Wake Forest are scheduled to begin at 9 a.m.
