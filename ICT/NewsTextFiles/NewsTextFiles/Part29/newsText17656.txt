The House is expected to pass a bill Monday night honoring some of the nations most distinguished and revered military aviators.

The legislation would bestow the Congressional Gold Medal on members of the famed Doolittle Raiders for their outstanding heroism, valor, skill and service to the United States in conducting the bombings of Tokyo during World War II.

Rep. Pete Olson, R-Texas, is backing the bill, HR 1209, along with 309 co-sponsors in the House.

A Senate version of the bill, S.381, passed in November. It had broad support there also, with 78 co-sponsors, according to a release from Sen. Sherrod Browns office. Brown, D-Ohio, led the effort along with Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark.

Brown also will meet Wednesday with retired Lt. Col. Richard E. Cole, one of four remaining members of the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders.

The remaining Raiders honored one another with a final toast Nov. 9 at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force. The Raiders paid homage to their late commander, Gen. James Jimmy Doolittle, and the 80 men who risked their lives during a World War II bombing mission on Japan, prompted by the attack on Pearl Harbor four months earlier.

The Congressional Gold Medal is the nations highest honor for distinguished achievements.
