Paul Davidson delayed his college education to serve in the Marines, and died hours before he was due to receive his degree from U of I Saturday morning.

Thirty-year-old Iraqi war veteran Paul Davidson was killed following a celebratory dinner with his family on Friday night, hours before he was to graduate from the University of Illinois with a degree in architecture.

Ever since high school, Davidson had an interest in architecture. But he delayed his college plans to join the marines right after 9/11. After serving his country in Iraq he returned to school and was to receive his degree in architecture from the University of Illinois Saturday morning.

Davidson was killed when he was hit by a car making a left turn while riding his motorcycle in Urbana, Ill., Friday night. According to his parents he was not wearing a helmet.

"He had bright lights on his motorcycle, he had loud pipes, she didn't see him or hear him," said Corinne Davidson, Paul's mother.

The fatal accident happened after Paul joined his family for a graduation dinner at his favorite barbecue restaurant. He left that dinner early to get a haircut for the graduation ceremony.  Shortly after he left he was struck by the car and killed.

At the University of Illinois graduation ceremony Saturday, Davidson's chair was left empty and bagpipes played. A former professor collected his diploma.

At home in Lemont, Ill., Davidson's parents remember their son as a strong-willed kid who loved designing buildings and had a passion for the outdoors. His funeral is planned for the morning of Friday, May 23, in Lemont.
