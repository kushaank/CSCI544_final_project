
Several recent studies show that entrepreneurial activity in the United States has slowed down, to the point where American businesses are dying faster than they're being born.

A report from the Kansas City Star analyzes new research that has some economists worried about what a slower startup rate could mean for the United States' future.

The report says economists aren't worried about business failures, which are expected and aren't happening at a faster rate than is usual. The concern is that failures release supplies into the market, like workers and buildings, and in a good economy, new startups come along to put those resources to better use. Without those startups, slack begins to appear in the market.
