
Brookhaven, GA, May 19 - The 2014 Brookhaven Bolt smashed previous records with over 1,800 participants! But that isn’t the only record that was broken. This year the Bolt raised a startling $47,000 that will be donated to Ashford Park School!

Banister also noted proudly that the Ashford Park, Montgomery & Sarah Smith elementary school run clubs – along with other kids in the 14 & under categories – totaled approximately 300 runners this year!

Ashford Park School raised their College and Career Ready Performance Index (CCRPI) up 10 points this year, Dr. McMillan proudly told us. Additionally, 100% of the school’s third graders passed the reading test – along with a 15% increase in Math scores.

“We are excited about what has happened [at the school] and the Bolt means we’re able to do things and provide things for our kids and for our teachers that we wouldn’t be able to otherwise,” said Dr. McMillan.
