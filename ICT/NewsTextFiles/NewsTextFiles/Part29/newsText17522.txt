
The Market Vectors Egypt Index ETF ( EGPT ) , the lone ETF exclusively devoted to North Africa’s largest economy, is locked in a tight battle with the Market Vectors India Small-Cap Index ETF ( SCIF ) for the honor of this year’s top-performing single-country emerging markets ETF.

Egyptian financial markets are preparing for the first initial public offering there since 2011’s Arab Spring. “Arabian Cement Company’s IPO was 18.5 times oversubscribed on the retail side and covered 11 times on the institutional side, including by US and UK investors, according to CI Capital, co-bookrunners on the float along with EFG Hermes,” reports Financial News .

There are, however, drawbacks. The run-up in Egyptian equities has EGPT trading at P/E ratio of 14.4, a premium to the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. Investors have also been subjected to above-average volatility with Egyptian stocks as highlighted by EGPT’s three-year standard deviation of 33.7%, according to Market Vectors data .

Still, there are signs Egyptian financial markets are evolving for the better. Those signs include the debut of the country’s first domestically-listed ETF, courtesy of Beltone Financial. The fund is expecte to debut late this month or in early June, according to the Financial Times .
