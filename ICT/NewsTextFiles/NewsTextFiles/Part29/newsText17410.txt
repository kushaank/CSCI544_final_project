
A female teacher at Waiakea High School is under investigation, accused of having a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old male student according to published reports.

Hawai`i News Now is reporting the two are accused of having sex in a room connected to the teacher's classroom at the school. Department of Education officials said the teacher, who's worked at Waiakea for 11 years, was placed on department-directed leave with pay about one month ago.

Sources described the woman as a "fabulous teacher" who's married and is well-known in the community since she's a graduate of Waiakea.  They also say the boy is still attending the school.

People familiar with the situation said the boy showed a school staffer racy text messages from the teacher with whom he'd been having an affair and the school employee notified the principal, who started the investigation.

Waiakea principal Kelcy Koga confirmed an investigation but could not confirm any details during the investigation.
