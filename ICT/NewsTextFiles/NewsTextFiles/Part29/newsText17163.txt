
The White House(WASHINGTON) -- Ask any teenager who their dream date to prom would be, and you’d most likely expect to get an answer like Justin Bieber or Harry Styles. But for one Connecticut teen, that dream date was 71-year-old Joe Biden.

At the age of 17, Talia Maselli, invited the vice president to attend her high school prom, calling him “the most delightful man in America,” according to The Courant newspaper.

"I am inviting you so far in advance because I'm sure many 17-year-old girls send you prom invitations, and I had to beat them to it," Maselli said in her letter to the VP.

Biden turned down the invitation, but he did personally pick out a corsage for her and invited Maselli to visit him at the White House.

Maselli, now 18, ended up not attending her prom.
