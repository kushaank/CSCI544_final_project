A Bay area teenager is helping to feed America. For Niritta Patel, it all started with an old piece of furniture. Last year, the 17-year-old found a discarded cabinet that she brought home, refurbished, and finally sold.

It turns out, that was just the tip of the iceberg.

The method raised several hundred dollars. But instead of pocketing the cash, Patel turned the money into a charitable donation: 501 boxes worth of pasta, to donate to Feeding America Tampa Bay.

Thomas Mantz, executive director of “Feeding America Tampa Bay”, says the contribution till feed families in 10 counties. Mantz said, Patel’s donation is something special.

“All of us would be grateful to be that aware at that age. I’m sure her parents are incredibly proud. But not only aware but willing and able to try and make a difference in the community. What a gift,” Mantz said.

The recognition doesn’t end there for Patel. Last summer, the teenager was honored as one of of “10 Young Women of Promise” by the Athena Society. The society awarded Patel for raising money and donating school supplies to 100 underprivileged children in Kenya. Patel told us, it was a rewarding experience.

Patel’s education is important to her too. The Hillsborough High School student is in the IB program and fluent in Spanish and Chinese. Patel hopes to go on to college, become a neurosurgeon and join Doctors Without Borders.
