
The theme of the lecture was: Engineering for Sustainable Development.

According to Nebo, previous industrial developmental initiatives of government failed due to lack of infrastructure.

He contended that technological advancement and discoveries by leading Nigerian scientists like Ezekwe were not utilised for national growth, especially after the end of the civil war.

The minister said if the proposed plan was well implemented, it would address some of the nationâ€™s infrastructure inadequacies and unlock the gateway to sustainable economic development.

The Dean, Faculty of Engineering of the university, Prof. Philo Igbokwe, said the essence of the inaugural series was to remember the contributions of Ezekwe to the field of engineering.

Igbokwe said the faculty would build on the legacies of Ezekwe by turning out engineers that would take the country to greater heights.

Vice Chancellor of the university, Prof. Boniface Egboka, lauded the exploits of the late scientist.

Egboka, represented by Dean of Post Graduate School, Prof. Okechukwu Anike, said Nigeria needed to identify its technological and scientific gaps.

According to Egboka, the gaps should be filled with adequate funding and corrective policies for the growth and development of the country.

Ezekwe, a civil war veteran, hailed from Abagana in Anambra.
