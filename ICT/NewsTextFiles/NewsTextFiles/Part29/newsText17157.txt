
Kenya: University of Nairobi student leaders have warned motorists to keep off major roads leading to the city centre due to today’s nationwide student s’ demonstrations.

Students Organisation of Nairobi University ( Sonu ) chairman Babu Owino urged motorists to keep off University way, Nairobi CBD, Moi Avenue, Parklands, Kikuyu Road and Thika Superhighway.

“If you are working within Nairobi and you own a vehicle, please leave it at home. We are further warning motorists to stay away from major roads leading to town since they will be flocked by demonstrators” he said.

“Education Cabinet Secretary Jacob Kaimenyi has remained silent over this matter and we strongly feel that the only way we can get his attention is through paralysing learning in our institutions.,” he said.

“We have also received information that one of our student leaders received a bribe to snub the demonstration. This will not work as all the student s in public universities are behind us,” he added.

The Sonu chairman said the nationwide demonstrations by student s from the seven public universities will continue until the Government addresses their grievances.

Sonu secretary general Jim Akach said it was unfair for the Government to increase university fee and lower the maximum loan awarded to student s by the Higher Education Loans Board.

The student leaders questioned the Government’s motive to raise university fee at a time when it was being haunted by the Anglo Leasing scandal.

“We won’t allow the Government to raise our fee so as to use part of the money to fund Anglo Leasing,” said Akach.

Among the grievances they  want addressed are reduction of current fee by half, increase of HELB loans and provision of grants to student s.
