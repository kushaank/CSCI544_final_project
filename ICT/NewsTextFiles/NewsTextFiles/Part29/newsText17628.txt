
In an article published online at FinancialTimes.com, Geoff Dyer says that the indignity swirling around the Obama administration concerning the unnecessary deaths of “dozens” of U.S. veterans in a VA hospital in Arizona threatens to “engulf” the president.

Dyer writes that the outrage surrounding Benghazi is contrived and that health care reform “fortunes … are improving,” then suggests that the shoddy medical treatment of military veterans, some of whom Obama prevented from entering the WWII Memorial in Washington, D.C. last year, “has the potential to attract broad political condemnation” of the Obama administration’s competence.

Before commenting on the VA scandal, maybe the overly protective Mr. Dyer should first exercise a little journalistic curiosity and take the time to observe how the commander-in-chief treats those who endeavor to protect him.

So let’s begin by looking at the similarities between Benghazi and the VA scandal.

Thanks to the pervasive incompetence of an administration that cares more about distributing free contraceptives, reducing carbon emissions, freeing convicted illegal-alien murderers and rapists, and congratulating gay athletes than its members cared about the lives of an American ambassador, a diplomat, and two former Navy SEALs, another 40 or more American veterans have also died unnecessarily.

In short, the veterans who died were Benghazied.

From Benghazi, let’s move along to the no-brainer of how the VA scandal reflects on the supposed “improving fortunes” of health care reform.

Think about it – those who are now coordinating the medical treatment of 300 million people are from the same government who mismanaged the medical needs of the U.S. veterans – promised health care that they never received and died waiting for.

That’s why it’s likely that, from Obama’s point of view, shredding machines and two sets of books were necessary for the common good.  Because if Americans were aware that nine million eligible U.S. veterans don’t actually have adequate, accessible health care, it wouldn’t bode very well for the other 291 million Americans now forced to depend on ACA largesse.  Thus, cover-ups are a necessary evil, required to protect and support the larger, more scandalous ruse.

The result has been a constant struggle to meet new demands, despite big spending increases. The budget for the VA has risen from $73.1bn in 2006 to $153.8bn this year. However, the number of outpatient visits at its facilities has increased from 46.5m in 2002 to 83.6m in 2012.

In 2010, right about the time that ObamaCare was being touted as the answer to all of America’s health care woes, the struggling VA claimed they would be implementing a “new appointments system, which promised a 14-day wait for an appointment with a primary care doctor or a specialist,” but never delivered.

Recently retired physician Sam Foote , after working for 24 years for VA hospitals in Phoenix, Arizona, blew the whistle on the situation.  He revealed on CNN that as many as "40 patients had died after being placed on a hidden waiting list that could last for up to a year, while officials at the hospital shredded documents and faked evidence to make it seem as if waiting times were under control."

So there you have it.  Despite the fawning journalists who view the atrocities within the VA system as a challenge to Obama’s improving status, the scandal that’s about to blow wide open is just more of the same Obama-influenced government ineptitude that will likely be proven endemic to the whole system.

Nonetheless, it’s unlikely that the man who is a master at slithering his way out of multiple controversies will be held accountable for a travesty that may wind its way back to the White House.
