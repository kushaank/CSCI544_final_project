
People from a variety of communities throughout Arkansas were in Warren for four days the week of May 5-8 to attend a wastewater training school.  The school was conducted in the conference room of the "Old National Guard Armory" located at 101 South Martin Street.  The building is owned and operated by the City of Warren.  The conference room is normally utilized by the Warren Police and Fire Departments as a training facility.  Hosting the school was the Warren Water & Sewer Department.

The training session was put on by the Arkansas Rural Water Association.  The class was taught by Susan Poe, a wastewater trainer/technican.  Employees from Monticello, Wilmar Ashdown, Jonesboro and a number of cities from around Arkansas were on hand for the training.  One attendee was from Harrison, Arkansas.

Municipal and private company employees who operate wastewater treatment plants and facilities are required to have appropriate licenses.  The training is rigorous and continuing education is mandated.

According to Warren Water & Sewer Manager Steve Rand, five Warren employees took part in the classes.  A test was given on the final day by the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality.  Eighteen individuals were tested and 17 passed.  A number of those attending stayed in Warren during the four day program.
