A woman died after allegedly being pushed to the floor by her husband at their residence at Sarve late on Saturday night.

According to the Puttur Rural Police, Janaki (40) locked the door of her house to prevent her husband Madankila (50), a daily wage worker, from entering it, around 8.30 p.m. According to a complaint by her cousin, the couple quarrelled regularly because of Madankila’s suspected alcoholism. When Janaki refused to open the door, her husband pushed it in a bid to break it open. In the process, a large part of the door fell on Janaki and she fell unconscious. By early morning, her mother, who lives with them, realised that she was dead. The police said the couple had three children. Madankila has been taken to custody .
