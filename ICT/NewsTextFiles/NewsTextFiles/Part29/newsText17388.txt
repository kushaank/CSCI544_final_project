
Clifford Street Elementary has been named a 2014 California Distinguished School by the California Department of Education and State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson. This honor recognizes schools that have demonstrated educational excellence for all students and have made progress in narrowing the achievement gap.

It occurs at a special time for the school because it also just gained unanimous approval from the Los Angeles Board of Education to convert to a Magnet. The school will reopen as Clifford Math and Technology Magnet in 2015. The conversion to a magnet will be huge since it will draw students from all over the district.

The staff’s magnet school application was approved during the May 13 meeting of the L.A. Board of Education. The Clifford magnet program, according to district documents, could accommodate 120 students in grades 1-6 in its first year and will eventually expand to the 162 students.

Fantastic!  This is a huge gain for Echo Park and the surrounding community.

Word to Eastside parents:  forget about “citizens” charter– it’s a mess!  Leave the teaching/administrating to the experts who know how to run schools and serve all children.  Clifford isn’t going to ask you to pony up at least $4,000 a year in donations (unless you want the stink-eye) and it’s right here in the ‘hood.  You *can* get a quality education from a public school.
