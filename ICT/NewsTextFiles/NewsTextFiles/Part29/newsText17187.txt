In 1914: Laborers are busy with the excavation of the Inman Hotel at the southeast corner of University Avenue and Walnut Street. Although they have excavated to a depth of more than 4 feet in some places, they have not yet apparently reached virgin earth. This section of the city originally was very low and apparently was a marsh. The old stable that was razed from the site stood on high brick pillars, yet the floor was hardly even with the grade of the sidewalk.

In 1964: More than a score of civil rights demonstrators began a sit-In Tuesday morning at the office of the Champaign County Board of Realtors in Champaign, protesting the National Association of Real Estate Boards' opposition to the civil rights bill now pending in Congress.

In 1999: The Urbana school board no longer will bus students from the neighborhood around the Martin Luther King School on the city's north side, unless parents agree to it. New students in the King neighborhood will attend King School. About 78 children in the area have been bused to Thomas Paine, Yankee Ridge or Leal schools.
