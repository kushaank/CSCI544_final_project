
Schoolboys in the western French city of Nantes took a stand against sexism on Friday by ditching their trousers and donning skirts for the day. The day of action has provoked outrage from conservative groups who plan to protest. Here's some images ofthe initiative.

However the furore and the nationwide headlines it has provoked did not put of dozens of boys from attending city's Clemenceau high-school in skirts. As seen in these images below.

And here is a short video from AFP with interviews of the young men who donned skirts. The interviews are in French without subtitles.

There were tense scenes outside a school in the centre of Nantes, western France, on Thursday, when around 200 supporters of the right-wing group Manif Pour Tous turned up to protest against the stunt.

The protest was organized soon after it emerged that education authorities in Nantes has invited boys to wear skirts to classes in 27 high schools as part of an anti-sexism day designed to promote equality in schools.

The thought of schoolboys wearing skirts has not been welcomed by the Manif pour Tous group, which led the protests against gay marriage back in 2013.

Protesters believe the initiative is concealing the fact that gender theory – the belief that children’s gender is not fixed at birth – is going to be taught in French schools.
