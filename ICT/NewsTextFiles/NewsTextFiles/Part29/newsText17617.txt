
PETALING JAYA - The relatives of missing Flight MH370's pilot Capt Zaharie Ahmad Shah have broken their silence to tick off those who have put forward pilot suicide as a possible reason for the plane's disappearance.

With all sorts of speculations swirling around about a purported suicide designed to collect a big insurance payout, the family is also upset that MAS has not spoken for him or protected him.

Asuad Khan, the brother-in-law of Capt Zaharie, reiterated that the experienced aviator did not even believe in having a life insurance policy.

"Not only did he not have a life insurance policy, he and his family do not have medical insurance coverage. Any insurance payout will only be from MAS," he said.

Speaking on behalf of his sister Faizah Khan, Asuad said the inaccurate speculation had tarnished Capt Zaharie's image.

"Arie had told Faizah that when he retired from MAS, any health problems would be dealt with at government hospitals and that they had to live within their means.

"He is a man with a sense of humour. 'We will be retired so we will have all the time in the world to wait at the hospital,' he had told his wife," said Asuad.

"His work is his passion and life has been good to him and his family, so why would he want to commit suicide as well as take the lives of 238 people along with him?"

With Malaysian police still looking at the possibility of a hijack, terrorism or even "pilot suicide'', Asuad said Faizah still gets interviewed by them and it is taking a toll on her.

"She is accepting the fact that Arie is dead but it gets to her when people talk bad about him without knowing anything about him.

"He is the most generous person in terms of advice, money and time," he added.
