
The Texas Tech University System Board of Regents has named Texas Senator Robert Duncan as the sole finalist for the position of Chancellor.

The announcement came from Tech early Monday afternoon, after numerous reports were released that the Board of Regents had chosen Duncan for the position, being vacated by Kent Hance.

The Tech Board of Regents will have to wait 21 days after naming Duncan as sole finalist before officially hiring him for the chancellor’s position under state law.

Duncan was first elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 1992 and to the Texas Senate in 1996.

Hance will transition to the position of chancellor emeritus.

The 60-year-old Duncan was raised in Vernon, Texas, and completed an undergraduate and law degree from Texas Tech.

“After conducting a nationwide search and considering several outstanding candidates for the position, the committee recognized that Senator Duncan has the vision and leadership skills we need for our great system to continue moving upward,” said Larry Anders, vice chairman of the Board of Regents and chairman of the chancellor search committee.

Duncan’s start date as chancellor is expected to be July 1st.
