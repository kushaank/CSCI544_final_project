
Albuquerque Mayor Richard Berry and Microsoft Corp. officials announced Monday that the company and city have formed a â€œstrategic allianceâ€� to bring more technology access and computer-skills training to city residents. The partnership also seeks to provide new resources for students and help small businesses and start-up organizations.

â€œWe live in a community of hardworking people and many students who are looking for skills development opportunities in order to build meaningful careers,â€� Berry said in a statement.

â€œThe demand for digital skills has never been higher. The strategic relationship we are establishing with Microsoft is an important step towards providing new resources and training to our citizens and critical tools for our students,â€� he added.

The city will work with Microsoft to create a â€œtrain the trainerâ€� model intended to help residents develop the digital skills required for many of todayâ€™s entry-level jobs. Berry said the city will identify groups with gaps in digital literacy and close those gaps by exposing residents to digital basics through Microsoftâ€™s Digital Literacy Curriculum.

Berry said the Microsoft BizSpark program will also focus on development and capacity-building for startups and small businesses.

Albuquerque students are involved as well. Brian Field , a general manager for Microsoftâ€™s state and local government business, said hundreds of local students will attend technology-exposure events such as Microsoft DigiGirlz and DigiDudes camps, where they can learn about technology challenges, interact with Microsoft executives and learn more about tech careers.
