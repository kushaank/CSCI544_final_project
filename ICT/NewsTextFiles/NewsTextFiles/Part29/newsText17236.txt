
The accident took place when a car parked to the side of the road because of a flat tyre was hit by a school bus.

One man was killed and a woman and 15 school children were injured when a school bus collided with a stationary vehicle on Shaikh Mohammad bin Zayed Road today morning.

The accident took place when a Honda Civic car, being driven by an Asian, was parked on the right-hand side of the road -- on the carriageway from Sharjah to Dubai right before Al Khawaneej exit -- to change a flat tyre, according to Colonel Saif Muhair Al Mazrouie, Acting Director of the General Directorate of Traffic of Dubai Police.

The car was then hit by a school bus that veered off its lane, killing the driver on the spot. A woman in his company was critically injured.

In another second traffic accident that occurred today morning, at 6:30 am, Colonel Al Mazrouie said a light vehicle driver entered the Emirates Road without making sure it was clear. At the Dubai-Al Ain exit, on the direction to Abu Dhabi, the driver collided with a truck that was travelling on its right course. Due to the strong impact of the collision, the light vehicle was tossed and rammed into another truck. The accident left the light vehicle driver with critical injuries.

On Saturday, the Abu Dhabi Police announced a one-month jail and fine for driving on the hard shoulder.
