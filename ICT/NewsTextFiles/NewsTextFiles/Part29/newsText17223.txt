An Occupy Wall Street activist was sentenced Monday to 90 days in jail for assaulting a police officer.

Cecily McMillan, a 25-year-old graduate student, was convicted after prosecutors said she deliberately elbowed a New York City police officer.

She could have gotten up to seven years in prison.

McMillan apologized in court but said it was an accident.

The incident became a rallying cry for some Occupy Wall Street demonstrators, who claimed it was one of many examples of police brutality.

There were thousands of cases stemming from the protests over economic inequality, most of which were misdemeanors.

A majority of those were thrown out.
