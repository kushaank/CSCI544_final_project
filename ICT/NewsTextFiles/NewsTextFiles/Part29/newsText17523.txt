
(ANSAmed) - BRUSSELS, MAY 19 - European Union will continue to send electoral observation mission to Cairo, Egypt during the period of the upcoming presidential election campaign, said Michael Mann, spokesperson to Catherine Ashton, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy for the European Union to reporters.

"Administrative challenges delayed the early implementation of the mission but the clearance of the necessary equipment for the mission has been finally given thanks to the constructive engagement of the (Egyptian) Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Our intention remains to have this elections mission deployed as widely as possible outside Cairo, and with a fair number of observers on the field", said Mann.

The team assessed the electoral legal framework on the ground, Mann further explained, and will continue to observe the campaign period throughout the region of Cairo, the performance of the election administration, and the overall political environment in order to ensure free and fair elections, including respect for fundamental freedoms, and of civil and political rights. It will also closely follow the performance of the media, voting, counting and tabulation of results, as well as the management of possible complaints and appeals.

The role of the head of the electoral team, parliamentary representative Mario David, was also explained. "He will present his initial findings,  two days after the election, during a press conference. An overall analysis by the EU team, with specific recommendations on the electoral process for further consideration by the Egyptian authorities, will be published at a later stage", said Mann.
