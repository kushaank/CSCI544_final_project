
NEW YORK (AP) — An Egyptian Islamic preacher brought to the United States on charges that he supported terrorism around the world from his perch at a London mosque has been found guilty.

Jurors in federal court in New York City returned their verdict Monday in the case against Mustafa Kamel Mustafa (muh-STAH'-fuh kah-MEHL' muh-STAH'-fuh).

The verdict came only weeks after another preacher who served as al-Qaida's spokesman immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks was convicted.

Prosecutors cited speeches and taped interviews to show that Mustafa conspired to aid terrorist organizations, including al-Qaida. Prosecutors say he aided kidnappers of 16 tourists in Yemen in 1998 and tried to build an al-Qaida training camp in Oregon in 1999.

Mustafa insisted during testimony that he never supported terrorists.
