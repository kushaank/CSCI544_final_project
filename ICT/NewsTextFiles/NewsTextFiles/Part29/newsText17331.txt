
Georgia State University officials and student leaders at campus radio station WRAS Album 88-88.5 FM met for the first time on Friday after school officials said they would turn over the stationâ€™s daytime programming to Georgia Public Broadcasting. Vice President for Student Affairs Douglass Covey said afterward that GSU is sticking with its plan, reports WABE.

WRAS has been on the air since 1971 and is one of the nation's most respected sources for new music and underground classics. A petition to stop the change has drawn support from across the country. Facebook pages and Twitter campaigns have also been launched to stop the change.
