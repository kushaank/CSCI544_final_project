
HAMPSHIRE-BORN actor Colin Firth is in the running to be crowned England’s national treasure after a nationwide vote.

The National Lottery has launched the search as part of its 20th anniversary celebrations this year. The What’s Your National Treasure campaign asks people to choose the best from a range of iconic venues, landmarks, faces and facilities that are vying for the title of National Treasure.

Firth, pictured, a former Barton Peveril College student, was selected for inclusion in recognition of his Oscar-winning turn in National Lottery-funded film The King’s Speech.

Other well-known names shortlisted are presenter Ether Rantzen, comedian Stephen Fry, athlete Jessica Ennis-Hill and pop band Rizzle Kicks.

Vote on Facebook.com/ LotteryGood Causes from 9am today until midnight on May 27.
