
The University of Arizona's College of Medicine is putting forth a plan to expand its Phoenix campus.

The proposed new building will be in downtown Phoenix, just north of the universityâ€™s Health Sciences Education Building.

The project will cost $136 million and take 26 months to build.

Funding will come from a borrowing program approved by the state Legislature in 2008. That same program, under which bonds are issued, paid for the other work on the Phoenix campus.

The Arizona Board of Regents will vote on the plan June 6.
