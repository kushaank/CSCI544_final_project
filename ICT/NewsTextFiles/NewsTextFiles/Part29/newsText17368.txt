
BRIDGEWATER – When Anthony Bazile moved from Haiti to Brockton in 2009 he barely knew any English.

Five years later he earned his college degree at Bridgewater State University.

“I’m really glad I made the choice to come here,” the sociology major said.

Bridgewater State University’s 2014 undergraduate commencement was Saturday when about 1,500 students received diplomas.

When he first moved to the U.S., Bazile practiced to learn English at Brockton High School, where he graduated from in 2010.

Bazile thrived after getting accepted to Bridgewater State University. In his four years at the school he was a resident assistant, an orientation leader and he volunteered at the school as much as he could.

He credits his parents’ strong work ethic for where he is today.

Bazile said he wants to attend graduate school at BSU and get his masters in public administration. He hopes to work for a nonprofit some day.
