
The film co-stars Brendan Sexton III, Veronica Cartwright and Bruce Altman.

One of the challenges Nirmalakhandan faced was ensuring that the role of Duncan was realistically and truthfully portrayed.

There also were physical challenges.

To make the audience feel as if they, too, were on the journey with Maya and Duncan, Nirmalakhandan and the crew embarked on a 2,000-mile road trip filming exterior shots.

All that work paid off when Nirmalakhandan saw the audience’s reaction to the movie at the Austin Film Festival premiere.

“The Odd Way Home” will be the opening film at the upcoming White Sands International Film Festival in September, with a fundraiser for HeARTS for Autism, a nonprofit organization that promotes autism awareness. The film also will screen in June in Albuquerque at the KiMo Theatre. and proceeds will benefit local autism charities, followed by screenings at the Waterfront Film Festival in Michigan.

Additionally, the filmmakers have partnered with the organization Autism Today.
