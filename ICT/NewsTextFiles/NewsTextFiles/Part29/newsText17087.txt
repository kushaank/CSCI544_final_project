
LANSING, MI (WLNS) – A local student got the surprise of a life time Monday when she was given a special award.

She thought she was going to an assembly, but instead found out she was the winner of a major scholarship.

The students of Windemere Park Charter Academy cheered on as a very surprised Victoria Judd accepted the $5,000 scholarship.

The eighth grader is one of only four in the country who received a national college bound scholarship.

Victoria won the award for an essay she wrote about a true story in which she helped a friend overcome thoughts of suicide.

Her piece was praised for helping others navigate the ups and downs of life and not giving up.

Victoria says she plans to save her scholarship money with the hopes of going to her dream college someday, Stanford University.

“We've always known that she was a very special girl but it’s nice to see it validated,” said Sandy Judd, mother of winner of $5,000 scholarship.

"Just try your best in school and try for those scholarships even if you don't think you're going to get them I mean -- clearly you do! “ said Victoria Judd, winner of $5,000 scholarship.

Victoria also says she hopes her award winning essay will inspire her classmates to believe that they can be successful, too.
