
At Boston University Commencement, a man from Massachusetts was arrested. He was charged for allegedly trying to bring two loaded handguns to the school. He incurred firearms violations.

On Sunday afternoon, the university police arrested Andrea Mass from Marshfield.

The wife of Massa, Sally Jenkins was at the event for her sister’s graduation. She told Boston Herald that her husband realized he will not be permitted to go in upon seeing the security area. He was arrested while leaving.

According to the District Attorney’s Office of Suffolk County, the 28 year old Massa has a license to care firearms as he used it for target and hunting practices. Because he violated the terms of the license, he then incurred a civil penalty.

The arraignment of Massa will take place on Monday. It will be in Brighton Court. It would be on the charges of unlawful carrying of the firearms upon entering the school premises along with disorderly conduct.
