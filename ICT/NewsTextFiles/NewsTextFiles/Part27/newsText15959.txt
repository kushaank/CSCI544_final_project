
A CATHOLIC priest and several pastors have been arrested for staging a peaceful prayer vigil in Tony Abbott's electoral office in Sydney.

The group entered the building in Manly on Monday morning and began praying for detained child asylum seekers and the prime minister's soul.

They were hoping to secure a promise from Mr Abbott to release the 1023 children held in Australian-run immigration detention centres.

The group occupied the reception area of the electorate office for about three hours before being arrested.

Police led the protesters outside about 2pm but laid no charges.

"Morally, it is up to people like myself as a church leader to take a stand on issues such as asylum seekers," said Rev Brian Brown, head of the Uniting Church in the NSW and ACT.

Dr Brown was among those arrested, along with a Catholic priest, a Baptist pastor, a pastor from the Metropolitan Community Church and several supporters.

A simultaneous sit-down protest was held at Opposition Leader Bill Shorten's electorate office in central Melbourne.

A Catholic priest and a nun were among the Melbourne group.

They were told by police to leave Mr Shorten's office by 5pm, but organisers suggested they would refuse that demand, possibly leading to further arrests.

Sydney protest spokesman Justin Whelan said staff at Mr Abbott's office had been "polite and respectful" but asked the protesters to leave before calling police.

Mr Whelan was among five people who were arrested and charged with trespass after a similar sit-in protest at Immigration Minister Scott Morrison's Cronulla electorate office in March.

A magistrate later dismissed the charges and noted that the protesters were entirely peaceful, adding: "This was the other end of the scale to the Cronulla riots."
