
No fewer than  20 people escaped death with varying degree of injury yesterday, when they were trapped inside a church building that collapsed in Agudama-Epie, Yenagoa, the  Bayelsa State capital during a heavy rain storm.

According to  eye-witness account, many people had ran into the uncompleted building housing the National Apostolic Church of Nigeria, for cover when the rainstorm started.

Apparently anxious to avoid being soaked by the rain, they did not notice that the pillars holding the building were mounted with bricks and wooden panels.

They were said to have heard a thunderous sound, which they thought  was thunder and when it dawned on them that  the sound was from the building signalling its collapse, it was too late.

Immediately, residents of the area moved into action and commenced rescue operation until officials of the state government came with ambulances.

The state Deputy Governor, Rear Admiral John Jonah (retd), was at the scene with the Commissioner for Works, Mr Lawrence Erdujakpo, the Commissioner of Police, Mr Hilary Opara and officials of Julius Berger construction company.

Erdujakpo said that the state government would invite the founder of the church for erecting a poor and substandard structure.

The Works Commissioner stated that the poor supervision of building structures in the state was caused by shortage of manpower in the Capital City Development Authority (CCDA).

According to him, Governor Henry Seriake Dickson has approved the recruitment of over  100 persons to increase the man power of the establishment.
