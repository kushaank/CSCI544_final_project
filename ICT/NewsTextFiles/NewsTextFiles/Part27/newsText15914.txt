Downtown Kansas City will be an even more exciting place for the arts in a few years.

The Crossroads already has many art galleries and studios. The Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts is downtown, and it is home to the Kansas City Symphony, the Kansas City Ballet and the Lyric Opera of Kansas City.

The University of Missouri-Kansas City Conservatory of Music plans to build a new facility near the Kauffman Center. That will be joined by the Kansas City Art Institute’s addition at 1819 Grand Blvd. for a new graduate program.

Having more students in the arts district downtown will make the area more lively, vibrant and attractive to young people. City officials can only hope that trend will spread into long-overlooked and neglected neighborhoods surrounding downtown, where there is a lot of affordable housing close to the city’s center, and much of it offers residents a view of Kansas City’s skyline.
