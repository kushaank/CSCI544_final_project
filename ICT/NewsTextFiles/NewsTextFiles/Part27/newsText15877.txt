
Sir: The Congress party in India has paid heavily for taking the common man for granted. They took a sort of ‘care-a-damn-attitude’, not realising it could be reciprocated in the same coin. One incident that shook Mumbai had been its chief minister’s dubious attempt to on the one hand regularise the illegal slums and on the other refusing the same to the Campa Cola residents.

The Gandhi dynasty no longer sells. The youth today are educated and conscious. They speak of development, infrastructure, good governance, entrepreneurship, etc. Also, the Indians are aware how the Gandhis insulted, hounded and misused Manmohan Singh. Sonia Gandhi had been cruel to Pranab Mukherjee, the backbone of the Congress. She wanted ‘yes-m’am’ party men around her. Moreover, the Congress supported and protected the corrupt and the fraudulent. The Food Security Bill had been an eye wash and the money never reached the poor.

During the election campaign the Congress party in general, and the Gandhi family in particular, were apparently interested in only protecting the Gandhi family from attacks by the opposition. Sonia Gandhi blundered by stooping to call Modi maut ka saudagar (Modi the trader of death). The common man abhorred this comment. The Congress had been playing the communal card while calling the BJP ‘communal’. This too has backfired.
