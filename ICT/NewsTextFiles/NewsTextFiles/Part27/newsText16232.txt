
The south east Lublin district is bracing itself, Monday for an oncoming flood wave on the Vistula River after several days of intensive rain in central Europe.

During the night the wave reached Sandomierz, though flood defences were not reported to have been broken there.

Minister for administration and digitization Rafał Trzaskowski said that though concerning, the wave is lower than computer modelling predicted.

“We are ready and confident but we must remain mobilised,” he said.

Plans had been laid overnight to evacuate several villages in the Lublin province, including Kępa Solecka, Kępa Gostecka, Braciejowice, Zakrzów, Las Dębowy, Grabowiec, Wrzelów and Koło.

Residents in Buszkowice, Podkarpackie province had to be evacuated when the River San burst its banks on Sunday.
