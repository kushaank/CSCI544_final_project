The Wichita Marketer of the Year started in 2008 as a way for the American Marketing Association to recognize top performers in the marketing industry. Individuals are nominated by their peers and asked to return an application to be judged by an American Marketing Association chapter outside of the community. This year, the AMA of Omaha judged the submissions of the Wichita finalists.
