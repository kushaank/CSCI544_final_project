
GEORGE TOWN: Political secretary to the chief minister of Penang, Wong Hon Wai condemned Bukit Gelugor independent candidate Mohd Nabi Bux for saying Lim Guan Eng supported the implementation of hudud law in Malaysia.

Mohd Nabi had alleged that Lim has never rejected the implementation of hudud in the country and has secretly supported the PAS leadership in the implementation of the Islamic Penal Code in Kelantan.

Lim, on the other hand, had made his stand clear that he will not support the private member bill in Parliament.
