BULLHEAD CITY — It could be a “first” for Arizona, said Cindy Frizelle, co-founder and president of Tri-State Military Moms, Inc. The nonprofit organization will launch its Military Banner Recognition Program during a presentation and dedication ceremony at Tuesday’s Bullhead City Council meeting, held at 5:30 p.m. in the council chamber, 1255 Marina Blvd.

Frizelle said banners will be on display until the service member is no longer on active duty, and will be installed twice a year, around Memorial Day and Veteran’s Day.

“Nominations are accepted ongoing, and sponsorship donations to defray any cost to the nominating family are gratefully accepted,” she said.

Banners will be available for viewing in the courtyard next to the council chamber after Tuesday’s ceremony, Frizelle said.
