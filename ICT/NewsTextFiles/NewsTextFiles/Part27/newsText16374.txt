It’s not about if they can, but if they want to get an ID.

In his column, Bill Minor quotes a liberal judge in Wisconsin who overturned that state’s voter ID law. A Marquette Law School poll shows that voter ID is approved in Wisconsin by a 60- to 36-percent margin. We can expect that a higher court will reverse the judge’s ruling just as the Supreme Court struck down a challenge to the Indiana Voter ID law in 2008.

Mr. Minor says that he has “finally realized what is the criminal intent of the voter ID scheme. (It says) we don’t believe you are who you say you are when the prospective voter’s name is found on the poll book.” Using this same reasoning there must be an awful lot of criminals in airports, banks, and Government buildings.

There is still plenty of time to obtain voter ID before the November elections. If those without ID really want (and that’s key) to qualify every provision has been made for them to do so short of dragging them there.
