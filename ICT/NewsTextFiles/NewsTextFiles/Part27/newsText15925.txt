
Gusau — Residents of  Gusau, the Zamfara State capital, have decried the increasing cases of rape in the state capital within the last one month.

Investigations by Vanguard in Gusau showed that victims of such cases were girls between the ages of nine and 15 years.

It was revealed that most of those raped were given between N20 and N50 to keep their harrowing  experiences secret.

A father of a nine-year-old girl (names withheld) who took his daughter to Yarima Bakura Specialist Hospital, Gusau, when he discovered that she had been raped by a 46-year-old man (names withheld), told Vanguard that the rapist gave his daughter N20 so that she would not tell her parents.

Also, hospital authorities said an average of nine teenage girls were treated weekly for rape related cases.

“We are in a serious situation as raping of children has become the order of the day. It is not known where mature people are now raping minors,” some parents, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said.

Police sources in Gusau also said 32 rape cases were recorded in Gusau in April this year alone.
