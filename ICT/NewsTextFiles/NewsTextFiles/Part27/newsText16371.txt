A special guest stopped by Sunday afternoon at ECHO. U.S. Ambassador to the UN and Obama cabinet member Samantha Power spoke with community members about politics and foreign affairs.

As a journalist, Power covered war in the former Yugoslavia. Eventually she went on to work for a then-Senator Barack Obama during his campaign, then his presidential campaign and now serves on the UN.

The Burlington High School Model UN moderated the event.

â€œI feel really thankful for having the opportunity to come to this country as well as there are thousands of immigrants out there. So I'm, it's awesome meeting someone who works for the United Nations. I wish I could talk to her more!" said Fabiola Mujomba, Burlington High School student and immigrant from the Republic of Congo.

Students from the group "Diversity Rocks" also showed their film "I Am The World" to the crowd.

As Ambassador, Power has focused on international human rights and conflict work.
