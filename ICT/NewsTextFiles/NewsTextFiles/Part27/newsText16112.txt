
The community of Busara Forest View Academy in Nyahururu on Saturday held a walk to raise funds to buy an incubator for Nyahururu District Hospital. The walk dubbed 'Save a Baby, Save a Nation' was part of the school's 30the anniversary celebrations.

The school was set up in 1984. It started out with 13 pupils and now has a fully established   Early   Childhood Development section and a primary and high school.

It emerged the best school countrywide in the 2004 KCPE examination. The   students, teachers, parents and other staff walked for five kilometres from the hospital in Nyahururu town to the   school, which is situated in Nyandarua West subcounty.

The   school's managing director Wangui Karanja said the 30 years have been   characterised by triumph over challenges. She said the celebrations   offered a moment of reflection and a fresh beginning with renewed strength   to serve the community with more vigour.
