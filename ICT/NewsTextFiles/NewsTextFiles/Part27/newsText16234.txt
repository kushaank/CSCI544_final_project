
A New Hampshire police commissioner who has repeatedly called President Obama a racial slur has resigned from his position, according to the Washington Post.

Wolfeboro-based Robert Copeland, 82, has admitted to calling Obama the N-word and has not apologized for his actions, after a fellow Wolfeboro resident heard him using it in a restaurant two months ago, according to the Huffington Post.

The resignation comes after Wolfeboro residents and politicians, including former presidential candidate Mitt Romney , called for him to step down from office.
