
BEAVERCREEK, Ohio (WDTN) – A 65 mph boundary line is expected to finally be crossed.

“Since 1979 this has been discussed,” says Beavercreek Mayor Brian Jarvis.

That’s when the planning for Interstate 675 started. Since its completion, it’s been a barrier for anyone wanting to walk or bike between Beavercreek and Fairborn.

“Two of the major retail centers in Greene County,” Jarvis says.

But, now a pedestrian bridge will soon be put out to bid for contractors. It would cross Interstate 675, connecting Commons Boulevard and Center Park Boulevard. The project is expected to cost about $2.8 million.

“The residents have asked for years for a healthy alternative to get from Fairborn to Beavercreek,” Jarvis says.

“Finally this council has the political will and has built up the relationships with surrounding entities to get things done now,” Jarvis says.

Along with the state, Wright State and Clark State are contributing funding.

The 1,900 foot long bridge is expected to be popular among students trying to get to the mall at Fairfield Commons.

Work is expected to start later this year. No date has been set yet for completion.
