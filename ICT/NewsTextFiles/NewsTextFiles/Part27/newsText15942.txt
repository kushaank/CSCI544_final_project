
The Libyan capital Tripoli is calm but still tense a day after gunmen stormed the headquarters of the General National Congress in the city and sparked clashes which left at least two people dead and 55 injured.   Local media reported on Monday that residents have largely avoided the streets as smoke continue to billow from the parliament building after several hours of sustained gunfire.

Sources say the attackers used light weapons and left the parliament building in smoke.

Sources said forces loyal to retired colonel Khalifa Hafter had sealed off roads leading to the GNC headquarters before storming the building but were reportedly repulsed by troops loyal to the GNC.

Residents in the area also spoke of overnight shooting which continued into Monday morning before the guns suddenly fell silent.

GNC chairman Nuri Abu Sahmain has denied reports that he had been kidnapped during the raid and reiterated his claim that Hafter was attempting to stage a coup, a claim Libyan MPs said they are investigating.

Sunday’s clashes followed Friday’s attack by Hafter’s men on an Islamist militia brigade in the Eastern city of Benghazi which killed at least 36 people and wounded over 100.

Hafter who had played a key role in the revolution had declared war on the militants and vowed to launch more attacks on the group until its members are defeated.

Benghazi airport still remains closed after the incident with an extension of the shutdown for 48 hours likely.

Since the end of the revolution which toppled Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 Libyan has witnessed a spate of violence including kidnappings as the country descended into several pockets of strongholds by various armed groups refusing to disarm.
