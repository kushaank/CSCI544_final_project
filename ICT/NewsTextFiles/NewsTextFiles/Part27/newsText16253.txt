BELGRADE, Serbia--Only days after water almost completely submerged the Serbian town of Obrenovac, another catastrophic flood wave was heading its way on Monday night.

Obrenovac, at the confluence of the Kolubara and Sava rivers, has been hit hardest by the worst flood on record in Bosnia and Serbia, where officials said the combined death toll reached 50 on Monday afternoon.

A surge of floodwater from the Kolubara over the weekend cut the town's power and communication, washed cars away and killing at least 12 people , Serbian officials say. More than 25,000 people have been evacuated, most of them from Obrenovac.

On Monday another wave was making its way down the far larger Sava River, a major tributary of the Danube. Residents not yet evacuated from Obrenovac after days of torrential rain were ordered to leave.

"There was a cataclysm," said Milenko Pravdic, a 54-year-old photographer who had been evacuated to Belgrade with his family.

After the first wave hit, Mr. Pravdic said, Obrenovac was as silent and dark as it had been during the NATO bombings of Serbia in the 1999 Kosovo War.

"Everything seemed to be hopeless," he said. "Electricity was gone quickly and within a few hours running water also stopped."

The water current was extremely swift after a dam cracked on the Kolubara, 10 kilometers upstream from Obrenovac, Mr. Pravdic said.

Troops arrived in the town the following day to aid in the evacuation. Mr. Pravdic said he and his family were saved by a group of people who came from Novi Sad, some 100 kilometers away, in an inflatable boat.

"When our phones eventually died, we didn't have any means to communicate or get any news," he said. "The people in the boat told us that the whole area was submerged."

Most of Obrenovac sits in a valley. Many there refused to leave their homes, fearing they would be looted. Refugees were brought to a bridge and taken by bus to Belgrade, where they were placed in schools and other public buildings.

"We only took the essentials," Mr. Pravdic said. "My home is of the least of my worries. I live on the third floor. What I'm really worried about is the rest of the people there."

Landslides complicated rescue efforts, and smaller towns along the Sava and Mlava rivers remained under continued threat of flooding.

The Serbian capital of Belgrade, at the confluence of the Sava and the Danube, has been secured with sandbags. The peak wave of the Sava was expected there by the middle of the week.

In Central Europe, authorities in Poland were also on flood alert. On Monday water levels were elevated along much of the Vistula River, the longest in the country. Authorities said the flood threat appeared less severe than in 2010, however, when property damage was estimated at billions of dollars.
