Marcella Holloman's son, who was diagnosed with a mental illness, was killed by police two years ago and says she still questions the department's policies.

Maurice Johnson had big plans to move to Las Vegas and one day get married, but that all changed two years ago.

Marcella Holloman knew her son had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had called the police for help in the past. So when Maurice became combative that day, she called police.

"I said my son had mental illness when I made the 911 call," Holloman said.

Within minutes of police arriving, Maurice was dead. Police shot Maurice several times after they say he reached for their gun.

While the officers were cleared of their wrongdoing, Holloman says she still questions the officer's actions and how they carried out the department's policies and procedures.
