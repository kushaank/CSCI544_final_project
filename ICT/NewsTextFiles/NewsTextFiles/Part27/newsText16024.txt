
KENOVA, W.Va. — Students at Ceredo and Kenova elementary schools continue to celebrate a major victory. They’re getting a new combined school thanks to voters who approved an $18 million bond last Tuesday.

Students from both schools lined up in Ceredo and paraded about a mile down the road to Kenova last Friday.

“The students made thank-you signs. We want to thank everyone who voted ‘yes’ for getting us a new school,” said Deidre Farley, the principal at Kenova.

The parade was the students’ idea according to Farley. She said they understand how desparately they need a new school and now they’re getting one.

The bond, the third attempt to pass one, had strong support from the community this time around. Eighteen-million dollars from the state School Building Authority and another $6 million from the county will be added to the bond to pay for construction of the new Ceredo-Kenova Elementary School, a new Crum Elementary and new classrooms and a secure entry at Wayne High School.
