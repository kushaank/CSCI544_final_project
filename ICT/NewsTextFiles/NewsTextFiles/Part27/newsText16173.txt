A few days later, HBO’s John Oliver remedied the situation by having 96 scientists join Nye in a debate against three anti-climate change folks.

Another member of the scientific community who’s not happy with the media’s tendency to give equal times to both sides is Cosmos host Neil deGrasse Tyson. On the latest episode of his StarTalk Radio Show, Tyson spoke to former CNN science reporter Miles O’Brien , who shared his frustrations with the standard operating procedure of that network and others.

Tyson and O’Brien began by discussing how journalism could be more like science, complete with a “peer review” process to help prevent errors. “Accuracy in journalism, that leads to the phrase, ‘Is it fair and balanced’?” Tyson remarked.

“I think it’s because journalists, historically, would report on politics, where you always have warring factions, and so you’ve got to give everybody time,” the pop scientist added. In a show like Crossfire, which is designed for left vs. right political battles, it becomes utterly impossible to capture that level of nuance, he seemed to suggest.
