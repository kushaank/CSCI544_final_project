
Sgt. 1st Class John Snider is the project site noncommissioned officer in charge of the Las Carretas site of the Beyond the Horizons 2014 - Guatemala, and a soldier from the 35th Engineer Brigade of Missouri. He has been here from day one, helping each rotation of soldiers complete more construction on the building that will serve as a medical facility for the local communities.

Snider is from Warsaw, Mo., where he is married with two children. He has served in the Army for 23 years total. He began his first 11 years of service in active duty. Six of those were served in Infantry and the rest of his time he has been with Engineering. After his active duty service, he became a Missouri National Guard soldier with the 35th Engineering Brigade. He has served during Desert Storm, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation Enduring Freedom. Snider has served on six Beyond the Horizon deployments now.

Snider’s responsibilities as a duration staff include overseeing the rotation troops as they come into the site, as well as assisting the platoon sergeant with ensuring the job stays on track, facilitating the job site, coordinating meals, and supporting with the battle update brief.

Snider not only works with the American soldiers rotating through the site, he also works with the host nation soldiers who go out everyday to work as well. These host nation troops may not speak any English at all, but that cannot keep the work from getting done. Sometimes alternative methods must be incorporated to get the work going.

Snider’s custom of telling the “joke of the day” comes from his time spent in leadership courses where they would show funny video clips before breaks. He has performed some stand up comedy before in his hometown, so he incorporated the two into his customs as a leader.
