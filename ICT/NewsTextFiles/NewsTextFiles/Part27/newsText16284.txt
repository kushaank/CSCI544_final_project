
SENECA - A rescue group that has been trying to help save a dog that has had its head stuck in metal duct piping says that residents in the area have reported that he is no longer trapped by the pipe.

Kelley Blair of the Upstate Animal Rescue of South Carolina said residents told them that the dog no longer had the piping on its head and was spotted eating some of the meat that was left as bait. The group, along with volunteers, had set up traps over the course of several days to capture the dog.

On Saturday, volunteers continued their efforts but were hampered when gunfire in the remote area scared the dog, also known as Piper, and it ran away. Piper is scared of people and won't let anyone near it.

A veterinarian said that the dog can drink, but can't eat because the pipe will barely let it open its mouth.
