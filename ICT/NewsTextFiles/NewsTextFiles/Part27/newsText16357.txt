MONTCALM COUNTY, MI -- Several Stanton residents were evacuated from their homes Sunday afternoon because of a natural gas leak after a crash on South State Street .

Montcalm sheriff's deputies responded around 12:45 p.m. May 18, around the same time as the Central Montcalm Public Schools graduation, which was taking place not far away.

Investigators determined a 46-year-old Saranac man driving a Ford F-150 pickup, towing a boat, was northbound on State Street and attempted to turn into a private drive.

At the same time, a 57-year-old Howard City woman in a Jeep Cherokee was northbound behind the boat. She struck the boat as the truck driver attempted to turn, police said.

The Jeep then veered off the road and struck a Consumers Energy natural gas line, resulting in a gas leak.

A small number of nearby residents were evacuated because of the leak. South State Street was closed for about three hours, causing some traffic issues for those attending the Central Montcalm graduation ceremony. The ceremony itself was not affected, police said.
