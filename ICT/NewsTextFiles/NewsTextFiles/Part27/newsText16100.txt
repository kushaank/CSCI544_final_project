
What an adventure!  Must say the barge holiday looks inviting.  Hope you are negotiating the purchase today.  It will be an excellent anniversary gift.

Joyce and I are going to Bellingen via a 110km highway at 120 km's/hour to ascertain the natives for a few hours.

Leah and Simon are good as.

Thursday, again via a 110 highway, we are going to the boat show at the Gold Coast, Joyce will go shopping.

Oh, what lovely people to help, must be Karma coming back at you for Keith helping the girls with their bikes.

Its all unanimous then, get the barge. No more following maps(only forwards or backwards) or hotels to find, just a never ending line of guests to contend with.
