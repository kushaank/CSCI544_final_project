NORDUnet, an international collaboration between the Nordic national computer networks for research and education (R&E), is transforming its network to offer flexible, high-capacity and resilient network connections to the Nordic National Research and Education Networks (NREN) community. NORDUnet is deploying converged packet optical platforms and software from Ciena(R) , the network specialist, for programmable 100G Optical Transport Network (OTN) switching.

This will enable NORDUnet to support demanding applications and high-bandwidth projects; such as bandwidth-on-demand, big data research, analytics and high-definition educational content.

-- NORDUnet operates an optical transmission system throughout Denmark,        Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland, Germany, Holland and the UK. With        Ciena's platforms, NORDUnet can respond rapidly to changing end-user        needs and provide on-demand services, such as the spontaneous transfer of        terabyte-class files amongst research institutes that are dealing with        big data, for applications that support medical research, meteorology and        energy research.       -- This is the first venture under the DANTE (Delivery of Advanced Network        Technology to Europe) framework agreement, project PRISM. Ciena has been        awarded an eight year term with DANTE, enabling European NRENs to select        its technology as they build and deploy next-generation networks. DANTE        plans, procures, builds and operates large-scale, advanced high-speed,        global R&E networks, including the pan-European GÉANT network.       -- NORDUnet is deploying Ciena's 6500 Packet-Optical Platform to maximise        bandwidth efficiency and network flexibility. Ciena's OneConnect        Intelligent Control Plane and OneControl Unified Management System will        provide improved network automation and management capabilities. In        addition, Ciena's Network Transformation Solutions (NTS) consultative        practice is providing a comprehensive operations and maintenance package        designed for NORDUnet's unique requirements.
