Independent local election candidate for Swords, Joe Newman, is calling on the County Council to sort out the chaotic traffic situation that occurs at peak times adjacent to the Lord Mayor’s pub in Swords.

He told the County Leader, “At most times, but particularly at evening peak times, drivers accessing River Valley from Swords town centre, are engaged in a free for all at the junction of Main Street and Church Road right beside the Lord Mayor’s pub. A number of residents from River Valley have complained to me about the situation. They do not know which lane to get into, as they wait for the lights to go red at the turn onto Forest Road. Some take the left lane, in the hope of being able to access the right hand lane, but this can mean blocking traffic going straight. This is causing irate drivers to honk their horns, adding to the anger and confusion. If they take the right hand lane, they are blocking traffic trying to access Church Road, on their way to Brackenstown. It’s a no win situation for these drivers,” said Newman. “Drivers are utterly confused as to what to do here, and I’m now calling on the Council to put a traffic management plan in place, to sort out this problem for once and for all, before there is a serious incident here,” he said.
