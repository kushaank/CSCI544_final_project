
JINDO, South Korea, May 19 (Yonhap) -- Rescuers resumed operations early Monday to search for 18 people still missing from last month's deadly ferry disaster amid weaker underwater currents.

After nearly a day of hiatus due to rough waters, Navy, Coast Guard and civilian divers restarted their job to find those still unaccounted for in the April 16 sinking of the ferry Sewol off the country's southwest coast.

So far, 286 out of an estimated 476 people on board the ill-fated 6,825-ton ship have been confirmed dead.

The start of a weaker-current period at the shipwreck site has boosted expectations for progress, but concerns also have grown over a possible collapse of part of the hull, according to the state response team.

Later in the day, President Park Geun-hye is scheduled to issue a public statement over the deadly accident, during which she is expected to apologize and set out plans on how to overhaul the national safety management system.

Over the weekend, hundreds of members of civic groups took to the streets in Seoul in protest against the government's bungling of the disaster. On Sunday alone, the authorities detained over 100 citizens who allegedly illegally occupied the streets while trying to march to the presidential office.
