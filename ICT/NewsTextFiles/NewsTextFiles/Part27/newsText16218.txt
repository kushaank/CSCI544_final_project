
Alstadheim, however, is not surprised about the high level of support shown by the latest poll. "The option, a republic, is probably quite unclear and unknown, and that is why many people still choose to support the monarchy. This is something we don't debate enough in Norway," he tells NRK.

Alstadheim thinks that the number in NRK's survey is higher than normal, and that other polls show a slightly lower support for the monarchy. Still, the monarchy has a strong position in Norway, he admits. "In the near future it is probably just as unlikely that Norway will abolish the monarchy as we will become members of the E.U.," the author predicts.

Grimstad thinks that the high support right now may be partly due to Norway celebrating the 200-year-anniversary of its constitution this year. People become more curious and attentive, and maybe even more engaged than usual, Grimstad says.

"The Palace is more visible right now," he tells NRK, but points out that a current support of 82 percent does not necessarily mean that this will be the case in three months or a year from now.
