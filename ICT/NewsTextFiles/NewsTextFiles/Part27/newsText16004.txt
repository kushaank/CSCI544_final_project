
At the Winona Area Public Schools (WAPS) Board meeting Thursday, the board unanimously voted to approve the new contract between the district and the Winona Education Association (WEA), also known as the teachers union. According to the contract, the district will pay $1,251,599 more in salary and benefits to teachers for the current and next school year.

The contract provides a one percent raise in salary for the current 2013-2014 school year and a two percent raise in salary for the 2014-2015 school year. However, the contract also eliminates the entry-level pay step and adds an additional pay step for teachers with with the most seniority. The additional top step is equivalent to a 1.2 percent increase for the current 2013-2014 school year and a 1.2 percent increase in the 2014-2015 school year. According to the Minnesota School Boards Association contract pay model, all of the salary increases amount to a 4.00 percent increase in the contract. Broken down by year, the district will pay $485,948 more in the current school year and $765,651more in the 2014-2015 school year, with a combined total of $1,251,599 in those two years.

As for the amount of WAPS teachers who are currently on the top pay step and will receive the additional raise, during a negotiations committee meeting last August, Blaisdell acknowledged that the majority of teachers are in the top longevity pay step.

The approval of the settlement comes after months of negotiations between the district and the WEA, which is the largest of the five WAPS employee unions. The contract settlement was reached on April 23 after a nine-hour private mediation session between the WEA, the districts negotiations committee, and a state mediator. Prior to the mediation session, the only formal meeting held between the WEA and the districts negotiation committee occurred this past fall, during which discussion centered on the correction of typos within the contract.

Overall, WAPS employee unions have either settled contracts with the district or have agreed to tentative contracts pending School Board approval.

In addition to the WEA contract, settled contracts include the WAPS educational assistants union, which agreed to a one percent salary increase in the current year, a 2.5 percent increase in the 2014-2015 school year, and a three percent increase in the 2015-2016 school year; and the WAPS plant operation and maintenance union, which agreed to a two percent wage increase for the current school year, a two percent increase for the 2014-2015 school year, and a 2.5 percent increase for the 2015-2016 school year.

Tentative contracts include the WAPS principals union and the WAPS clerical employees union, with both contracts to be presented to the board sometime in June. For now, the tentative contract agreement with the principals union includes a two percent salary increase for the current school year and a two percent increase for the 2015-2016 school year; while the tentative contract agreement with the clerical employees union consists of a two percent pay increase in the current year, a two percent increase in the 2015-2016 year, and a 2.5 percent increase in the 2016-2017 school year.
