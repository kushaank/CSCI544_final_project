Fresno County Fire officials say that a fire at an abandoned apartment in the Calwa area was caused by arson.

A fire destroyed a 14-unit abandoned apartment in the Calwa area on Sunday.

The blaze started around 3 p.m. at Laurite and 9th streets. Residents rushed to save a smoking truck, while firefighters rescued at least two dogs. One of them appeared to be OK, but the other had blackened fur over parts of its body.

Officials say a combination of wind, a lack of space in the neighborhood, and a lot of spectators made their efforts more difficult. They also had to make sure no one was left inside the complex because transients are known to stay there.

Late Sunday night, Fresno County Fire officials announced it was caused by arson.
