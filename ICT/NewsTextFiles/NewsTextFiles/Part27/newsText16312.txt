
Metallica’s James Hetfield has signed onto The History Channel as narrator for the new show ‘The Hunt’.

‘The Hunt’ follows a group of hunters who travel to Kodiak, Alaska to hunt for the Kodiak brown bar, considered the largest land predator on Earth.

A Kodiak bear hunt generally lasts 10 days with the hunters living off the land with supplies carried on their backs. The Alaska Department of Fish & Game allots 496 tags via a lottery system for hunters to apply for the chase. Thousands apply.

THE HUNT is produced by Twofour America for History. Seth Goolnik, Austin Reading, Grady Candler and Danny Villa serve as executive producers for Twofour America. Elaine Frontain Bryant, Tim Healy and Matt Ginsburg serve as executive producers for History.
