
For those potential presidential candidates thinking of talking up all of their experience in Washington to sway voters' minds, they may want to reconsider such a strategy.

A new study from Pew Research shows that 30 percent of voters said they'd be less likely to support a candidate with "many years" of Washington experience, while 48 percent said it wouldn't matter either way.

This is a considerable shift from 2008, when voters were nearly twice as likely to support a presidential candidate who had cut their teeth in Washington.

Also, only 44 percent say Congress provides preparation for the White House — compared to 66 percent in 1987.
