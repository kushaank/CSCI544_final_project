
TAIPEI, Taiwan -- The government of Taiwan is exploring areas of cooperation with its allies in the Caribbean and Latin America as the world battles with balancing economic development and environmental protection, said a Taiwan environmental protection official.

Minister Wei Kuo-Yen (é­�åœ‹å½¥) of the Environmental Protection Administration said the country wants to share lessons learned from its experience with development.

In April, Taiwan and the United States signed the International Environmental Partnership, which paves the way for Taiwan increasing its influence with the global community in the area of sustainable development.

Wei said that Taiwan is considering different areas of involvement with the International Environmental Partnership, but not limiting the options to its diplomatic allies.

â€œBasically, it will be a regional approach,â€� he told journalists participating in an eco-living in Taiwan media tour.

â€œThe second thing is education,â€� Wei continued, adding that Taiwan's environmental protection legislation is among the most rigidly enforced in the world.

He further said that Taiwan is considering region-specific projects, such as the possible installation of a tsunami early warning system that would also benefit countries in Southeast Asia.

Wei, who has a doctorate from the Graduate School of Oceanography at the University of Rhode Island, said international cooperation is needed in light of tensions between developed and developing countries concerning blame and responsibility for contributions to environmental degradation.

â€œWe need mutual understanding and Taiwan can play a very interesting role. We have that kind of experience. We have sympathy for both sides,â€� Wei said.

He added, â€œI think developed countries owe something to the whole world, the whole planet. Developed countries have already enjoyed so many of the natural resources of the Earth. Because of that, we face the problems of climate change, rising sea levels, deforestation and also pollution.

Wei said that Taiwan is â€œin the middleâ€�, and added, â€œWe also have to do something to extend a helping hand in terms or our technology, probably financial (support), and experience.

â€œEnvironmental problems are crossing boundaries. An unhealthy earth will have effects on everyone, be it developed countries or developing countries.

â€œSo, we have to do it together, and we don't have much time. Maybe we have another 30 to 50 years to deal with this problem.

Wei said that the EPA wants to act both domestically and internationally, and allowing Taiwan to have some international involvement is important.

He was referring to Taiwan's exclusion from several international agencies and organizations, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, because of the political situation with China.

Speaking about Taiwan's own situation, Wei said that the country does not pay enough attention to sustainable development.

â€œI think that in Taiwan, before the establishment of the EPA, we emphasized economic growth,â€� he said, adding that, â€œSustainability is (now) the key concept.

â€œTaiwan is now paying a lot to compensate for what we did when we focused so much on economic growth. Once you have pollutants dispersed in many places, it takes a lot of resources to go back to the original situation.

â€œSo, if you take a long term view, you regret having focused too much on economic growth and too little on conservation or protection. That's the lesson I think Taiwan has learned and many countries have also learned this,â€� Wei said.

â€œYou want to have good development in this generation, but you don't want to harm or do anything detrimental to the next generation. That is the basic idea. That is a balanced view. We emphasize inter-generational justice,â€� he further stated.
