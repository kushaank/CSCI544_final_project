
Madhya Pradesh Special Task Force (STF) is on the lookout for a senior engineer of the PWD in connection with the PMT scam as he allegedly got his daughter admitted to a government medical college through unfair means in exchange of a hefty amount of money.

The STF is searching Executive Engineer Markam Singh Rawat as his daughter allegedly cleared PMT through unfair means in lieu of huge amount of money, a probe agency official said today.

At present, Rawat is posted in the neighbouring Dhar district.

The official allegedly paid a huge amount of money to a gang involved in the scam in 2013 to get his daughter admitted to Indore's Government Mahatma Gandhi Memorial (MGM) Medical College through the PMT.
