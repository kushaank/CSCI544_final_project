
The Milwaukee Plan Commission unanimously approved a proposal for teacher housing at the former Dover Street School site in Milwaukee after a previous project plan was downsized.

The compromise gained the support of Ald. Tony Zielinski , whose district includes the site. Earlier proposals with more apartments raised concerns over parking, traffic and the safety of children and people attending the church and caused the plan to be reconsidered and downsized.

The new plan will renovate the existing school building, creating 43 apartments. But instead of adding a three-story new apartment building on the property, the plan calls for a series of two-story townhouses.

Patricia Najera , chairwoman of the Milwaukee Plan Commission, said the compromise that happened over the various meetings was great and she was in favor of the new proposal.

â€œItâ€™s friendly to the neighborhood and it speaks volumes that the alderman and the neighborhood support it,â€� Najera said.

The total apartment count is 75 units.

The developers of the project are CommonBond Communities Inc., based in St. Paul, Minn., and Maures Development Group LLC, of Milwaukee. The project is supported by the Greater Milwaukee Committee , which helped negotiate the latest plan, because it will create a housing community for Milwaukee teachers.

The townhouses in the new plan would face East Dover Street and East Potter Avenue on the exterior of the block, and 96 parking spaces would be in the center of the block. The developers still plan to lease space on the property to St. Lucas Church and School.

Mark Ernst , partner at Engberg Anderson , said the apartments would also have underground garages suitable for single-car use.

Pending city approval, renovation work on Dover Street School could begin in January, and construction of the townhouses could begin next year. Work on both could be done by fall 2015, he said.
