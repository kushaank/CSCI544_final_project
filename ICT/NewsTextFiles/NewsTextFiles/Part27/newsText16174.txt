KEYSER - Four candidates for the position of superintendent of Mineral County Schools will be in the hot seat Monday as they field questions from both the 13-member citizen's committee and the five members of the board of education.

The board met late Friday afternoon to screen the seven applications received, and the process of narrowing the field down to just four was a difficult one, according to board president Kevin Watson.

1. Susan K. Ray of Keyser, current director of curriculum and instruction/Title I/pre-k with the Mineral County School System.

2. Shawn L. Dilly, currently administrative director of the South Branch Career and Technical Center in Petersburg.

3. David S. Tupper, currently middle/high school principal at Bruceton School in Bruceton Mills, Preston County.

4. Michael P. Lewis, currently a private business owner and former principal at a residential school for youths in Cumberland.

"We were very pleased with the applications we received," Watson said.

Interviews with the citizen's committee will begin at 4 p.m. Monday and will be held in open session in the Terry L. Cannon Conference Room at the Mineral County Technical Center.

As each candidate concludes that interview, he or she will progress to the board office next door for their interview with the board. Those interviews will be conducted in executive session.
