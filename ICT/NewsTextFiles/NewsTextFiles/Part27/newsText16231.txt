
A crowd of about four hundred people, including students, alumni, and community members, gathered to celebrate Filipino music, dance, and culture Saturday night in Kane Hall at the UW Filipino American Student Association’s (FASA) annual Filipino Night.

This year’s theme was, “We Are Not [VOICE]less.” Bello said FASA chose this theme to share the idea that the Filipino voice and other minority voices can be heard in the vast UW community.

FASA’s dance troupe Sayaw performed three different suites of various types of Filipino dance, according to Candice Adams, Sayaw Coordinator. They performed one suite with Spanish influence, one that shared stories from the southern Philippines, and one to honor a troupe member who passed away last quarter.

Sayaw co-instructor Patrick Pineda said that the history of the Philippines has been influenced by many different cultures such as the Chinese, Spanish, and Islamic cultures. The group tried to show the different influences these outside groups have had on Filipino culture through their dance performance. They also chose songs that would be relevant to a college audience so that the viewers could relate to the performance.

According to Kathryn Alcid, Sayaw assistant instructor, there are also different regions of the Philippines and different ways of life also expressed in their dances.

The show also featured performances from other campus groups, including First Nations at UW, Hui Hoaloha ’Ulana, Jazz Espritu, Micronesian Islands Club, and the Polynesian Student Alliance.
