(JTA) — Beirut’s only synagogue is set to reopen following a five-year renovation.

The Magen Avraham synagogue, located in the former Jewish quarter of the city, was opened in 1926 but partially destroyed at the beginning of Lebanon’s 15-year civil war in 1975, according to the Times of Israel, via an Arabic report in London’s A-Sharq al-Awsat.

The Lebanese Jewish community now has 100 members, and Isaac Arazi, the community’s leader, says Jews, Christians and Muslims all donated toward the project, estimated to cost $1 million. Renovation began in 2009.

Arazi hopes the synagogue will rejuvenate Jewish life in Lebanon. He said he is proud to be Lebanese, and conveyed antipathy toward Zionism and Israel.
