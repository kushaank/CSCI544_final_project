Tribeca’s Washington Market Tavern will open in a restored storefront in June.

The much-anticipated neighborhood bar and restaurant, at 41 Murray St., will be overseen by Aksel Theilkuhl, the former executive chef at STK’s two NY locations.

Owner Eric Schwimmer bought the retail space for $2.45 million at auction and restored the exterior of the 1937 landmark building.

The 4,500-square-foot, two-story space can seat 140.

The design incorporates handcrafted custom wood millwork by LMF Group, including two mosaic murals based on Milanese artist Piero Fornasetti’s originals, re-created with silver leaf and torch-burnt reclaimed white oak.

Long Island City’s Penthouse 808, at the Ravel Hotel, officially relaunched last weekend with stunning views of the Manhattan skyline.

Executive chef Seth Levine, inspired by a trip to Hawaii, created a “Pacific Rim cuisine” menu.

Signature dishes include grilled swordfish skewered onto a 3-foot sword and a raw seafood tower served with a telescope and a map of the constellations and visible New York City landmarks.

Penthouse 808, at 8-08 Queens Plaza South, adjacent to the Queensboro Bridge, has 110 seats inside and an equal number outside.
