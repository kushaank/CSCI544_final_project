
More than 200 qualified, community-based non-profit organizations in Colorado will receive funding from Wells Fargo through the 20th annual Wells Fargo Community Assistance Fund. The fund is just one component of Wells Fargo's overall philanthropic efforts. In 2013, Wells Fargo's community contributions in Colorado totaled $4.2 million to approximately 1,100 organizations, and the company team members logged more than 45,000 volunteer hours.

Eligible organizations must be certified 501(c)(3), and have an annual budget of $350,000 or less. Applications are now available at all 170 Wells Fargo stores in Colorado and are due June 30.

"Helping our local non-profit organizations is a long-time tradition at Wells Fargo and an important way we serve our communities," said Frank Newman, Wells Fargo's president for the Rocky Mountain Region. "These organizations work very hard and do so much to ensure our communities are the best they can be. We are proud to share that all decisions to provide funding for these organizations are made right here in Colorado."

The Wells Fargo Community Assistance Fund was started in 1993 to provide greatly needed support to small, non-profit groups that don't have the resources to compete with larger organizations for community support dollars. Since its inception, more than 4,200 grants totaling more than $4.3 million have been awarded.
