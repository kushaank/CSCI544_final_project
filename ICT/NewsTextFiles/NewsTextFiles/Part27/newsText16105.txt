
Minister of Women and Vulnerable Populations wants to help her countrywomen eliminate domestic violence.

Carmen Omonte, Peru’s Minister of Women and Vulnerable Populations, is calling on Peruvian women to stand up against domestic violence.

Omonte, while meeting with the Seventh Women Leaders Congress in Puno, urged women not to let their intimate partners hit them and to work together toward eradicating abuse.

La Republica reports that Omonte also reminded women that they can seek help at any of the 11 Women’s Emergency Centers that are located in Puno. While in the region, Omonte also helped distribute kits meant to protect residents of the area from cold, as very low temperatures are expected in the months to come.

Omonte also stressed the importance of economic independence for women in the fight against gender-based violence. “The women of Peru have talent and strength to push forward many different projects that will let them contribute to development,” said the minister.

In addition to increased economic participation, Omonte also called for greater political participation on the part of Peruvian women.
