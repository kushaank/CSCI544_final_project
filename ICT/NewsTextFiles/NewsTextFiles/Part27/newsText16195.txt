
Six Malian government officials and two civilians have been killed in an attack by rebels in northern Mali, the country’s UN peacekeeping force says.

The head of the mission, known as Minusma, called the killings in the town of Kidal a “barbaric crime”.

On Saturday, at least 17 people died in clashes between the army and Tuareg rebels in Kidal. The fighting broke out during a visit by PM Moussa Mara.

In 2012 a Tuareg rebellion in northern Mali triggered a military coup.

Civilian rule was re-established in 2013, but Islamist and separatist forces remain active in some areas.

During Saturday’s fighting the rebels captured the local governor’s office, seizing 28 people.

It is unclear whether they are among the dead announced by the head of Minusma, Albert Koenders, late on Sunday.

“An inquiry must be carried out quickly in order to verify the facts and bring the responsible parties to justice,” he said.

Earlier, Mr Mara said his government was now “at war” with the separatists. The total death toll from Saturday’s fighting is unclear: earlier estimates put the number of dead at 36.

Malian Defence Minister Soumeylou Boubeye Maiga has said reinforcements were being sent to Kidal.

“We will double our troops on the ground if necessary,” AFP news agency quoted him as saying.

The rebels are from the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA).

The United Nations is attempting to negotiate a truce between the Malian army and Tuareg rebels.
