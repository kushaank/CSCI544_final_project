
The documentary takes us on a journey to revisit the history and origins of Hawaii and its people. How they came to develop an independent civilization globally recognized until the overthrow of the monarchy and the illegal annexation by the United States in 1893.

The Hawaiians believe that during the first few decades of the 20th century the U.S. was devoted to overriding the native language, Hawaiian culture and replace it with tourism. All this as a mask to hide the true goal: to make Hawaii the most important military base of the American empire.

The Kingdom of Hawaii was overthrown in 1893. The Kingdom fell, in many ways, because the monarchs were inept, and corrupt. The Republic of Hawaii ruled over the islands until 1898, when the US Annexed it.

Get it together, guys.

I am a Kanaka Maoli (aboriginal Hawaiian), a Hawaiian (national), and a law school student.  The Hawaiian Nation State is currently under belligerent occupation by the United States.

The truth is being suppressed under a myth that Hawai'i was legally annexed by the U.S., which it was not.  The occupation has continued for well-over a century and in that time, aboriginal Hawaiians have been subject to severe indoctrination.

Anyway, now Native Hawaiians are just 9% of the population, and half of them mixed with colonists....So there is no way back in Hawaii.
