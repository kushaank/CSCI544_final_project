
In reaction to the annual cull of thousands of kangaroos, animal rights group Alphadog says kangaroo numbers can be controlled in a non-lethal way and is working with Australian officials on an experiment to administer birth control to hundreds of kangaroos.

In an attempt to pacify angry animal rightsÂ protesters, officials in Canberra will be administering birth control to kangaroos in an attempt to significantly lower birth rates amongst these animals in a non-lethal way.

An annual cull is planned to reduce kangaroo numbers by 1600, with 500 more kangaroos to receive birth control.Â  The animals will be tranquilized and injected with the anti-fertility drug Deslorelin,Â theÂ Sydney Morning Herald reported.
