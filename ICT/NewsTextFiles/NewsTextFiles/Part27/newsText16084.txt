
After nearly three years of fighting, rebels surrendered the 13 besieged neighborhoods of Old Homs to regime forces during the week of April 28th. The truce stipulated that rebel fighters and residents be allowed safe passage out of the besieged areas in exchange for handing over 70 prisoners to the regime.

In order to push rebels to sign the truce in Old Homs, says Khudair Kheshfeh, 26, a prominent opposition activist, the regime pounded the area with artillery and barrel bombs, while using starvation during the nearly two-year siege.

"Besieged residents started eating beetles, frogs and grass," says Kheshfeh, who earlier this year relocated from Outer Homs and now operates between northern Syria and southern Turkey.

There are several reasons fighters accepted the truce in Homs, among them a lack of food; besieged residents started eating beetles, frogs and grass. In eight reported cases, individuals died because of poisoning from eating grass. Food was one reason for the truce, but it was not the main one.

The blockade stopped the flow of heavy weapons into the city; rebels could only use weapons that were already here. Secondly, there were relatively few fighters compared with the large area they controlled, 13 neighborhoods under siege.
