
There’s a new effort to repeal Mayor Dan Sullivan’s controversial labor law, and this time it comes from Jennifer Johnston, one of Sullivan’s traditional allies on the Anchorage Assembly.

If voters repeal the law, the Assembly would be barred from re-enacting the measure for two years under city code.

A spokeswoman for Sullivan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Johnston said she wants more discussion about her proposal at the Assembly subcommittee’s next meeting, in two weeks.

The measure has been suspended since August, when a Superior Court judge ruled that a union referendum campaign was legally valid, in spite of arguments from city officials.

Assembly members then voted in October to repeal the law entirely, but Sullivan vetoed that effort, and proponents of the repeal lacked the eight votes required for an override by the 11-member body.

Labor law opponents said Friday they were open to discussing Johnston’s proposal, though they were not particularly enthusiastic about its contents. Assemblyman Dick Traini, who’s been the chief advocate of repeal, said Johnston was only compromising because she was afraid voters would reject the law in November.

Traini said he will propose his own measure at the Assembly’s first meeting in June that would repeal the law without leaving any of its changes in place. If that passes, Traini said, then he’d be willing to discuss a compromise package.

While Traini acknowledged that there might not be eight Assembly members who’d support his proposal in a vacuum -- the number needed to get past Sullivan’s veto -- he stressed that he’s now working from a position of strength.

If his opponents don’t want to play ball, Traini said, then he’ll simply withhold his support for Johnston’s measure and let the public decide.
