
The Simon Community is calling on the Government to fast track the social housing strategy in a bid to tackle the growing homelessness problem.

It comes as official figures show that six new people end up homeless each day in Ireland, while housing list figures have grown by 42% per cent in the past year.

A new Housing Action Group, set up by mothers affected by homelessness, will be launched today in a bid to force the Government to tackle the housing crisis.

"We need to move back into a situation where local authorities are actually building and supplying social housing. Without a shadow of a doubt hat's something that needs to happen," said Niamh Randall, spokesperson for the Simon Community.

"We need to get a better balance in terms of our housing provision and our social housing mix."
