
Tuesday, May 20, 2014 - Islamabadâ€”To accommodate the increasing pressure of traffic, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has decided to expand Islamabad Highway from Rawat to Koral Chowk to 10 lanes.

The Planning wing of the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has issued the layout plan and cross-section of the project and now tenders would be invited for the construction work.

However, it is still unclear that whether the road will be constructed under Roads Department of the civic authority or the new company of CDA which has been awarded the right of way of Islamabad Highway.

The highway from Faizabad to Koral chowk is already of 10 lanes and now the width will be extended to Rawat as long queues of light and heavy traffic are seen throughout the day particularly during morning and evening hours. Similarly, the road from Zero Point to Faizabad will also be widened to 10 lanes, while another loop will be added in Faizabad Interchange.

It is to be mentioned here that traffic pressure on Islamabad High-way has significantly increased as residents of Korang Town, Pakistan Town, Behria Town, Media Town, Judicial Colony, Doctors Town, PWD Housing Scheme, National Police Foundation Scheme, and Ghouri Town use the road. The residents have appealed to the government to start the project on priority basis.
