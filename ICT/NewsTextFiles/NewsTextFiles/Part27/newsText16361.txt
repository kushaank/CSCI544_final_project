
The man, identified Monday as Lorenzo Baltazar-Trujillo, fell from a steep, rocky area near Grizzly Peak Boulevard, police said. It's not known when he fell, but a hiker found Baltazar-Trujillo's body around 2:20 p.m. Sunday.

"To be honest, we're not sure. We think he was probably trying to climb a rock and slipped," UC Berkeley police Lt. Marc DeCoulode said. "There could be any number of reasons why this happened."

DeCoulode said Baltazar-Trujillo was not a student at UC Berkeley. He died at the scene. Police said there were no signs of foul play, but the results of toxicology tests to determine whether Baltazar-Trujillo was drinking or had taken drugs won't be known for weeks, according to the Alameda County Coroner's Office.

Baltazar-Trujillo's death was the second involving a fall at the popular hangout spot in 18 months. In November 2012, 24-year-old Richmond resident Jonathan Mendiola Urbina climbed to the top of a rock outcropping and fell about 60 feet to his death.
