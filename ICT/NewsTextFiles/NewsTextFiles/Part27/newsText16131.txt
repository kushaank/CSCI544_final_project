
Former U.S. senator and Democratic presidential hopeful John Edwards’ return to the courtroom as a lawyer ended with a settlement and a mistrial.

A jury in Pitt County deadlocked last week on whether to hold an emergency room doctor responsible for brain damage and other problems suffered when a 4-year-old Virginia boy was brought to what is now Vidant Medical Center in 2009.

Edwards plans to ask for a retrial against the doctor. It was his first trip back in the courtroom since his criminal trial in 2012.

The family of Kaiden Gaymon also sued the hospital, and Edwards said both sides reached a $13 million settlement that should help the boy get treatment for his health problems.

“I was happy to be back in the courtroom. We fought like crazy for this kid. That’s what this case was all about,” Edwards told WNCT-TV outside the courthouse.

The boy was an infant in 2009 when he was diagnosed with a respiratory virus at a hospital in Jacksonville. Edwards said a breathing tube was not working properly, and the boy didn’t have adequate oxygen for several minutes, causing brain damage and other problems.

In 2012, Edwards stood trial on six felony charges in a case involving nearly $1 million provided by two wealthy political donors to help hide his pregnant mistress Rielle Hunter as he sought the White House in 2008.
