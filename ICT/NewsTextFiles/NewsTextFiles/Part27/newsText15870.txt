
MARGAO: Locals residing in and around old market area in Margao have threatened to stage a dharna, if  Margao police does not take necessary action against the alleged  illegal hutments that have cropped up on the open ground near  Kadamba Transport Corporation bus terminal in Margao.

Locals demanded that the police conduct the migrant verification process at the least, as they suspect the involvement of these migrants in the recent rise of theft cases in Margao.

It maybe recalled that a delegation of residents from old market area had earlier submitted a memorandum to the police and the Margao municipal council (MMC) citing suspicions against the hutments, but no action was taken by either of the authorities.

Citing the recent case of the Sao Jose de Areal blast, where the police took time to check the records of the deceased, as the migrants had not submitted any identification documents, locals requested that the police or MMC verify the antecedents of the migrants to prevent any such problems in the future.

Residents from the old marlet area further complained about the nuisance cauesed by the migrants who defecate in the open. "It is disgusting sight to see someone openly defecating. This is an eye sore for all those entering the town," said a local resident.

The locals have planned to carry out a  protest rally in front of the MMC, if authorities continue to ignore their cry.
