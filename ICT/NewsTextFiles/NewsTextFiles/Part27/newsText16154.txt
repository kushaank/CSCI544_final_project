
Bucking his own leadership, Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) is pushing for a vote on a scaled-back immigration measure that would give legal status to young undocumented immigrants who serve in the military.

Denham announced Monday that he has formally filed his measure, called the Enlist Act, as an amendment to a must-pass defense policy bill that the House will take up this week.

Denham’s move to force a vote comes after House GOP leaders have signaled they won’t allow a vote on the measure. A spokesman for the second-ranking House Republican, Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), said Friday that no amendments on the Enlist Act will be made in order with the National Defense Authorization Act — effectively blocking it.

That move dealt another blow to immigration reform in the House this year – which, while not impossible, faces significant hurdles in the Republican-led chamber. Denham’s proposal that’s now unlikely to get a vote was a limited legalization measure focusing on a narrow group of undocumented immigrants.

Meanwhile, the Democratic-led Senate passed a comprehensive overhaul nearly a year ago that revamped essentially every part of the current immigration system, such as a pathway to citizenship for millions of immigrants living in the country illegally.

Conservative opponents objected to Denham’s measure, calling it amnesty for those who are in the United States unlawfully. They also raised concerns that a divisive issue such as immigration was getting wrapped up in a must-pass bill like the NDAA.
