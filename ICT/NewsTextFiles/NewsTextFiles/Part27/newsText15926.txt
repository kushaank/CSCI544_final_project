
The Family Shelter of Southern Oklahoma recently received a $40,000 grant from the Southern Oklahoma Memorial Foundation to support the shelter’s operations.

FSSO provides a safe living environment for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking along with their children for up to 30 days. The grant will fund a key position with the organization – shelter advocate. The shelter advocate coordinates the transition program and assists victims with fundamental needs. The goal of the program is to assist victims in the transition from shelter residency to independent living. Grant funding will also be used for shelter operations.

“You do not have to be a resident of the shelter to receive services. We provided nonresidential services to close to 150 men, women and children last year. It is only with our local support, such as the Southern Oklahoma Memorial Foundation, that we have been able to make a difference in victims’ lives in our community for more than 20 years,” said Stacey Mason, FSSO executive director.

To receive assistance from the Family Shelter, contact the 24-hour Crisis Line at (580) 226-6424.
