The death of Ashley Mendoza, 3, was ruled a homicide by the Cook County Medical Examiner's office.

The girl's body was found in a home in the 3300-block of North Natchez Avenue around 8:30 p.m. in the Schorsch/Dunnings neighborhood. Her identity was released on Monday after the autopsy, which determined her cause of death as multiple injuries due to child abuse.

Steven Kispetik lives in the apartment downstairs from where the girl's body was found. He said family has lived in the apartment for about three years.

"I wish I had a hearing aid. Maybe I could've prevented something. I didn't hear nothing. I just heard that banging between 3 and 4 o'clock yesterday," Kispetik said. "They're a very quiet couple. They never interfere with anything. I mean, I have no explanation."

Chicago police are questioning a person of interest.
