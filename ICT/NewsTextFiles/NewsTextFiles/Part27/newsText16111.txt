District Malaria Office is breeding Gangusia fish,that is known to keep a check on the dengue mosquito, for free distribution. "The fish is available at the District Malaria Office in Jacobpura. It feeds on mosquito larvae and doesn't need any other food. The fish can be put in water tanks and pipes where mosquitoes breed easily," said Dr V K Thapar, deputy civil surgeon, vector-borne diseases.
