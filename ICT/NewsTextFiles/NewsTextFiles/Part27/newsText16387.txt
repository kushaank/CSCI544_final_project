
Eyewitnesses said the confrontations started when Israeli forces broke into East Jerusalem's Kafr 'Aqab neighborhood.

Two Palestinians were wounded by rubber bullets and scores of others suffered temporary asphyxiation from teargas on Monday morning in clashes between Israeli security forces and residents of a Palestinian neighborhood in Al-Quds (occupied East Jerusalem), eyewitnesses said.

Eyewitnesses said the confrontations started when Israeli forces broke into East Jerusalem's Kafr 'Aqab neighborhood.

Neighborhood residents responded by hurling stones at the Israeli security forces, the eyewitnesses said.

They added that Israeli soldiers responded with teargas and rubber bullets, leaving two Palestinians wounded in the legs, while scores of others suffered temporary asphyxiation from teargas.

Kafr 'Aqab is under security and administrative control by the Israeli government, as it is located inside Area C of the West Bank.

Accounting for around 60 percent of the total West Bank, Area C is inhabited by 300,000 people, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

The reasons for Monday's raid on the neighborhood by Israeli force are still unclear, but Israel usually breaks into Palestinian villages and towns in the West Bank in order to detain "wanted" Palestinian activists.
