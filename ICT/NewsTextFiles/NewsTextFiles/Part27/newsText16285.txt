
Developers who are working on plans for another apartment community in West Dallas have released more details about their proposal.

Henry S. Miller Co. and architect Good Fulton & Farrell have detailed the Cliff View project in filings with the City of Dallas’ economic development commission.

They want to build a 318-unit, $43 million rental community on four acres just north of Fort Worth Avenue. It’s right near the Belmont Hotel.

The developer wants to construct six apartment buildings ranging in height from two to seven floors.

They’ve asked for $4.7 million in tax increment finance district funding to help pay for infrastructure and environmental remediation for the property.

Cliff View is one of four new apartment communities in the works for West Dallas.
