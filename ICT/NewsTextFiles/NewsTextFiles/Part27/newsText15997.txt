
A St. Paul man admitted Monday he raped and strangled a woman in her apartment, where her young son later found her dead.

Sammy Devel Henderson, 25, pleaded guilty in Ramsey County District Court on Monday to second-degree intentional murder of Sherell Craighead, 30.

His sentencing is scheduled for July 15. It was not immediately clear how much prison time he could face.

Early Sept. 1, Craighead's 7-year-old son found his mother dead in their apartment in the 500 block of Minnehaha Avenue in the Payne-Phalen neighborhood, according to the criminal complaint.

The boy walked to his grandmother's house about 7 a.m. He told her his mother was "sleeping naked and bleeding from her back," the complaint said. Craighead's mother immediately went to the apartment and found her daughter's body cold to the touch in a "large pool of blood," the complaint said.

Henderson, who told police he had been seeing Craighead several times a month, said he had forced sex on her the previous evening and she had become "quiet" afterward, but he did not realize she was dead.

He initially was charged in Ramsey County District Court with second-degree murder. The Ramsey County grand jury later indicted him on first- and second-degree murder charges.
