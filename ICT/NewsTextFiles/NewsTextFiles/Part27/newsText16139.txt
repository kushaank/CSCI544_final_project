
Hundreds of Britons have had dream holidays in Kenya cut short after being evacuated under armed guard in the face of a growing terror threat.

The Mirror reports that package holiday firms Thomson and First Choice have begun flying 500 tourists back to the UK after a spate of kidnaps and bomb attacks. The Foreign Office has warned against all but essential travel to parts of the country including tourist hotspot Mombasa and the eastern border with Somalia. This follows concerns of imminent attacks from Somali militants Al Shabaab, whose leaders include White Widow Samantha Lewthwaite, one of the world's most wanted terrorists. 'There is a high threat from terrorism, including kidnapping,' the office said in a statement. Two explosions in the capital Nairobi and at a luxury hotel in Mombasa earlier this month left seven people dead. Kenya blames the blasts on the al-Qaeda linked Somali group al Shabaab.
