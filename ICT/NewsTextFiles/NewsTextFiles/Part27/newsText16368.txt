
Residents in one Colorado community are concerned after a man reportedly tried to snatch a 10-year-old boy from a playground.

The youngster says he hit the man with a stick, and ran to a neighbor's house for help.

It happened  at Champion Academy, located between Loveland and Berthoud along Highway 287 in northern Colorado.

The incident has parents concerned as we enter a time of year when many children spend a lot more time outside.

The Larimer County Sheriff’s Office is encouraging parents to talk to their children about how they should handle dangerous situations.

One option is "NO, GO, YELL, TELL,” meaning in a dangerous situation children should say "no," run away, yell as loud as they can and tell a trusted adult what happened right away.
