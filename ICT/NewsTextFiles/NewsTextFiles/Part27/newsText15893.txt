COMMUNITY cops say they are determined to put the brakes on nuisance bikers.

Officers from the Nuneaton West Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT) said they will not tolerate those who have been causing misery to those who live in and around the Stockingford area.

It follows the seizure of a quad bike in Kingswood Road.

Members of the West SNT were out on patrol when they spotted a man on a quad bike on the path on Kingswood Road.

They stopped the suspect and told him that the bike was being ridden illegally and in an anti social manner.

Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) Rachel Ames of Nuneaton West SNT explained that there has been a spate of incidents in the area, and the seizure of the bike highlights how serious they are about tackling the problem.

"The team have had ongoing issues with nuisance bikes in the area and this sends a message that the public will not have to put up with careless and inconsiderate driving in their neighbourhood and the blatant disregard for the quality of life in the local community," PCSO Ames said.

Anyone with any concerns about crime in their community should contact their local SNT, details of which can be found by logging on to www.safer-neighbourhoods.co.uk.

Information can also be passed on to police anonymously via the Crimestoppers hotline, which is free to call from a landline, on 0800 555 111.
