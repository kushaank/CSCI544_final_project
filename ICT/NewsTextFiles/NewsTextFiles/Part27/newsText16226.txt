
Demonstrators decry what they say is Yitzhar's role as a base for price-tag attacks against Palestinians in the area and inside the Green Line â€¢ "We do not see the connection between Yitzhar and 'price-tag' actions," Yitzhar spokesperson says.

Israeli army reservists and activists gathered outside the settlement of Yitzhar on Sunday to protest price-tag attacks and Yitzhar's alleged role in them.

Some 30 protesters including reservists and members of anti-hate crime organization "Tag Meir" ("Enlightenment Tag") rallied outside the settlement.

Among the participants in the protest, which did not receive police approval, were Tag Meir Chairman Dr. Gadi Gvaryahu, Reservist Forum founder Yaya Fink and Labor MK Itzik Shmuli.

Yitzhar residents greeted the protesters with food and beverages. The protesters spoke about Yitzhar's role as a base for price-tag attacks against Palestinians in the area and within the green line.

Citing the contentious book Torat Hamelech ("The King's Torah"), which was published in Yitzhar's Od Yosef Chai Yeshiva and focuses on rules regarding killing non-Jews during war time, the protesters blamed the rabbis for creating an ideological foundation and motivation for price-tag attacks and violence against security forces.

Yitzhar's spokesperson issued a statement, saying that "aside from the cursing and the showcase of hatred for Yitzhar, in the name of tolerance for Arabs, we did not see the connection between Yitzhar and 'price-tag' actions."
