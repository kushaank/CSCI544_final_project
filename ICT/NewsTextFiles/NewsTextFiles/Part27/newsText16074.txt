Twenty questions were dealt with during the forum which followed earlier meetings between ministers and community groups.

About 200 people attended the community cabinet last night at Hurstville where residents had the chance to question Premier Mike Baird and his ministers.

Twenty questions were dealt with during the forum which followed earlier meetings between ministers and community groups.

Subjects ranged from the need for motorcycle parking spaces at Beverly Hills, rail service cuts and home schooling regulations to job losses in the region, St George Hospital’s needs and mining in the Woronora catchment.

Residents who attended were a given a fact sheet listing the government’s ‘‘achievements’’ in southern Sydney.

Mr Baird opened the forum by saying there had been ‘‘a big shift in NSW’’ since the Coalition won government in 2011.

‘‘I think we are doing a good job,’’ he said.
