
Former Irish Superbike champion Michael Pearson is said to be stable in hospital in the Czech Republic.

The 37-year-old from Ballygowan in County Down came off during the Superbike race and suffered a back injury and internal bleeding.

Pearson has been taken off a ventilator and is responsive and able to talk. He is expected to recover in the long term.

Prior to the incident, Pearson had won the Supersport 600 race and had qualified on pole position for the Superbike event.

The accident happened at the first corner on the opening lap when another competitor came off and collected Pearson, who slid into some trees. He was airlifted to hospital.

His parents and wife are with him at the hospital.

It's bad enough when no one else is involved, but to be wiped out by another rider making a mistake is extra harsh. Still, after hitting some trees maybe he's lucky things were not even worse.
