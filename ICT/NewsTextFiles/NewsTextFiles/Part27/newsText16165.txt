A hiker came across a body in the woods near Grizzly Peak on University of California at Berkeley property Sunday afternoon, a police lieutenant said.

At about 2:20 p.m., a female hiker found the body of a deceased male at the base of a 100-foot cliff near a popular hiking spot. The hiker began giving first aid to the male, but soon realized he was deceased, UC Berkeley police Lt. Eric Tejada said.

The hiker called police and waited in the area until they arrived.

Tejada said the deceased male was possibly in his early 20s. Investigators have not reported any signs of foul play.

The lieutenant said a person died at almost the same location last year, but witnesses were present during that incident.

The deceased person's identity has not yet been released.
