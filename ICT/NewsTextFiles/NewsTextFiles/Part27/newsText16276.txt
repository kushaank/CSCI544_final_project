
The scandal around the US Vice President Joe Biden's youngest son is gathering momentum. German parliamentarians have criticized the appointment of the 44-year-old Robert Hunter Biden to the Board of directors of Ukraine's largest  private oil and gas company, Burisma Holdings.

Sevim Dagdelen, a representative of the Left Party, stated that Biden junior’s appointment is a "slap in the face to all those currently looking for a resolution to the crisis in Ukraine".

The Europeans apparently started to see the light. At least they have noticed the fact that Washington's interest in Ukraine is far from altruistic. Burisma is considered to be the largest private oil and gas company in Ukraine. It includes several production facilities. The holding develops deposits in the Dniepropetrovsk, Donetsk and Kharkov regions, as well as in the Carpathian and Azov-Kuban basins. This year the company is planning to increase gas production by 35-40%.

In the past democrat Barack Obama built his presidential campaign on accusations directed at George Bush stating that his foreign policy had been dictated by desire for oil and gas. As an example, he cited the war in Iraq. In the early days of the US military campaign against Saddam Hussein, when Baghdad was still not occupied, Mary, the daughter of another American Vice President, Dick Cheney, was working on oil contracts on Iraqi territory.

History seems to be repeating itself. Oil and gas has, once again, become the main target of the US Administration, although it is now presented as a fight for democracy.
