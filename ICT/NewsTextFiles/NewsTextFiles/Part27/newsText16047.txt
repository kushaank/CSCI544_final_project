An official statement said that 500 or so rushed at the border at the Spanish exclave of Melilla, with about 20 people perching on the 20 foot-high fences until they were all escorted away by Moroccan authorities.

Around two hours later a further 200 migrants were intercepted by police.

Recent months have seen waves of immigrants attempting to cross into Europe via Spanish territories Ceuta and Melilla.
