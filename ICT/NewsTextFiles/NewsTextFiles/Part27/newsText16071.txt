
President Benigno Aquino III on Monday said the country will meet its goal of 10 million tourists when his term ends in 2016.

“We remain committed to breaching the 10-million mark by the time my term ends in about two years and one month,” he said in his keynote at the UN World Tourism Organization-ASEAN International Conference on Tourism and Climate Change in Albay.

He doused water on some industry remarks about lack of infrastructure and other negative factors.

“We met our target for 2016 five years ahead of schedule. This pushed us to set our sights higher,” Aquino told his the delegates and other participants at the Oriental Hotel in Legazpi.

He said the sector has reached the 35.5 million domestic travellers target by 2016 “five years ahead of schedule” and adjusted a new  goal of achieving 56.1 million travellers.

“Largely due to the economic and social benefits of the project, as well as the participation of the local community, Donsol went from a sixth class municipality to a first class municipality in less than five years,” he said.

A sixth class town makes less than P15 million annually; first class, earns P55 million on the average.
