
Chronic homelessness in the Greenwich-Stamford area has soared in recent years, climbing quicker than in any other area of the state, according to a new report.

Each year, the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness conducts a Point In Time Count complying with national standards, tallying the number of homeless people staying in shelters around the state. This year, the count was carried out on Jan. 29, a night when temperatures dipped to as low as 2 degrees, and 3,571 homeless people from around the state found a place to stay in emergency shelters and similar facilities.

The number of single adults who are chronically homeless has shot up 77 percent in Stamford since 2009, almost twice as quickly as in the rest of the state, which has seen a 47 percent increase, according to the coalition.

"It used to be that chronic homelessness was about substance abuse or mental health issues," said Jason Shaplen , chief executive officer of Stamford-based Inspirica , which provides shelter and other services for the homeless. According to the coalition, people reporting some kind of mental illness account for 37 percent of homeless people in the Stamford-Greenwich area, compared to 42 percent of the statewide number.
