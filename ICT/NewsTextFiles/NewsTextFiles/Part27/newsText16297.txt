
Engineering For Kids, the beloved science, technology, engineering, and math program, is excited to announce that the company has awarded its 100th franchise. The newest franchise, located in Lakeland, Florida, marks an achievement that has surpassed the expectations set by CEO Dori Roberts, “This has been an amazing accomplishment that was unexpected in less than three years of franchising.  We are very proud of our franchisees who are inspiring the next generation of engineers.” Engineering For Kids is now inspiring in 26 states and 9 different countries.

Founded in July of 2009, Engineering For Kids first began offering its programs to young engineers in Northern Virginia. Dori Roberts decided that the best way to inspire the next generation on a global scale was through the franchise platform. The first Engineering For Kids franchise was awarded in December of 2011 and the 100th agreement was signed in April 2014. In 2013, Engineering For Kids increased system sales by 351.3%. With ever-increasing revenues, Engineering For Kids is excited to expand into new regions and inspire the next generation of engineers all over the world.

As a low-barrier opportunity with room to grow, Engineering for Kids franchisees have the option of taking their home-based franchise and eventually open a learning center, which are typically 1,200 square feet in size. An ideal franchisee is someone who is well connected in their community, a parent or an individual who has a passion for educating children.
