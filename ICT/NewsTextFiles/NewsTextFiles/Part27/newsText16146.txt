
Not only is Mattie Do the first female filmmaker from the country of Laos but she's also the first horror filmmaker from the area, bursting onto the scene last year with the ghost story Chanthaly. Now, she's working on her second feature, and she needs your help. Read on!

Just launched on Indiegogo, in partnership with Twitch, is the fundraising campaign for Do's second film Dearest Sister (Nong Hak), which she describes as one of the most ambitious films ever produced in Laos.

Dearest Sister tells the story of a village girl from southern Laos who travels to Vientiane to care for her rich cousin who has mysteriously lost her sight, and somehow gained the ability to communicate with the dead. When the poor girl realizes that her cousin is receiving messages from the spirits that allow her to win the lottery, she has to choose between nursing her cousin back to health or keeping sick in order to get rich herself.

Do is looking to shoot the film this fall on location in Vientiane and out in the jungles in the surrounding province, but first she needs $30,000, to cover the costs of things like special effects - which will be completely practical - color correction, sound mix and a new camera. You've got through July 2nd to pitch in, and help Mattie make what will be the 13th Lao feature film ever made.

Head over to the Dearest Sister Indiegogo campaign to help out. We also encourage you to check out the utterly charming pitch video below, to learn more about this historic horror film!
