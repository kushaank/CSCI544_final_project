
Nicolet National Bank in Medford is building a new bank.

On Monday, community and bank leaders celebrated the groundbreaking of the $3 million project. The new building will span more than 10,000 square feet.

Medford Mayor Mike Wellner says the project is sign of growth in Medford.

"We have a new hospital, we're redoing a lot of things in our city and this bank will be very visible to people as they drive through," said Wellner.

The president of Nicolet National Bank says the new building should be completed by this fall. He says once it's finished, what's left of the old office will be knocked down.
