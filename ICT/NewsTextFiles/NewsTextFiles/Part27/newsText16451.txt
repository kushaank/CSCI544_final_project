
Prague, May 19 (ČTK) — Significant Czech painter and graphic artist Adriena Šimotová died in Prague this morning at the age of 87, her niece Michaela Šetlíková told the Czech News Agency.

Šimotová's lyrical works from the 1960s focused on human figures and landscapes.

In 1972, the death of her husband, painter Jiří John, was a breaking point in Šimotová's life. She abandoned the classical style and preferred the direct physical touch instead. She started to make installations and 3-D sculptures dealing with human figure and face.

She worked with paper that she cut, scratched, crumpled and deformed to make fragile paper sculptures and reliefs.
