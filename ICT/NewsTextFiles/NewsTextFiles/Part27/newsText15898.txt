
Voters in the 4th District for Humboldt County: I have worked with both candidates, Chris Kerrigan and Virginia Bass, on the Eureka City Council and know them well. While I consider both to be friends, I have found their views on major issues to be quite different.

Chris supports investing in our neighborhoods and eliminating blight. As a councilman, he was instrumental in saving an historic home from demolition in addition to collaborating with College of the Redwoods to restore it. Not two blocks away sits the dilapidated Downtowner Motel, whose owner Virginia Bass recently appointed to the county Planning Commission.

As a councilman, Chris represented all citizens of Eureka equally, not just moneyed special interests. On the other hand, Virginia voted to accept an exclusive right to negotiate with a company wanting to build a Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) terminal on Humboldt Bay even though the vast majority of input from the community expressed opposition to LNG and its inherent dangers.

Chris advocates smart planned growth that includes protecting our resource lands, investing in infrastructure, and nurturing our quality of life. He supported the development of a master trail around Eureka and has served on the board of Keep Eureka Beautiful. Virginia says she supports trails while appointing and voting for planning commissioners who wish to remove a countywide trail system from the General Plan.

Chris Kerrigan is clearly the right choice for the 4th District.
