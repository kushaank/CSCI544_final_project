
Tampa, Florida, May 4, 2012—The United Methodist Church approved this week a resolution urging the US Congress to adopt the DREAM Act, which would create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrant youth who attend college or serve in the military.

Currently, unless the state in which they reside has passed a law stating otherwise, undocumented immigrant students pay prohibitively high rates, like those paid by foreign students, to attend college in the US. Since 2001, only 11 states have passed laws allowing these students to qualify for in-state tuition at public institutions.

DREAM is an acronym for the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act.

Serving at the local church level, Francisco Canas, executive director of The United Methodist Church’s National Plan for Hispanic and Latino Ministries, says he meets many young people in this situation.

The bi-partisan DREAM Act, introduced in the US Congress in 2001, would open the possibility of higher education and a conditional pathway to citizenship for these students, called “DREAMers.” The act would grant conditional lawful permanent residency to undocumented high school graduates or GED recipients.

This temporary status would last six years and enable DREAMers to work lawfully, continue their education, or enter the military. During this period, they would have to either complete two years in a program for a bachelor’s or more advanced degree or serve in the uniformed services for at least two years and, if discharged, receive an honorable discharge in order to become eligible to apply for citizenship.

The DREAM Act, supported by The United Methodist Church meeting in General Conference this week, would remove significant impediments that keep young immigrants from attending college.
