
Gripen fighter jets [PHOTOS\VIDEO], The Czech Republic will continue leasing  Saab Gripen fighter jets for another 12 years under a government-to-government  agreement signed Friday, Saab said.

The air force of the Czech Republic flies 14 Gripen C/D jets under a 2006  lease from Sweden, which expires next year.

"With this  agreement, the Czech Republic is taking a long-term strategic decision to  continue operating Gripen and ensuring the continued development of its national  capability," said Lennart Sindahl, senior executive vice president and head of  Saab's Aeronautics business area. "This is further proof of the confidence in  Gripen, and its defense capacity."

The Gripen is a single-engine, multi-role fighter first introduced in the  late 1990s. It has a maximum speed of 1,372 miles per hour at high altitude and  a combat radius of 497 miles. It's flown by three other countries in addition to  Sweden and the Czech Republic and was selected last year for procurement by  Brazil.

Details of the leasing agreement were not immediately available.
