
Delaware State Police say troopers are investigating the deaths of a husband and wife found in the parking lot of a community clubhouse in Sussex County.

Troopers were called to the lot behind the Bayview Estates clubhouse in Selbyville early Monday for a report of two people lying on the ground. Police say troopers found 63-year-old Edward Watkins Sr., and his wife, 53-year-old Robin Watkins. Both were pronounced dead at the scene.

Officers say the two drove to the clubhouse separately late Sunday, where Watkins shot his wife twice and turned the gun on himself. A handgun was found at the scene.

Investigators say the two lived just over the state line in Bishopville, Maryland.
