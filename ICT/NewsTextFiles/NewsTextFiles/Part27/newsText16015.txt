
Students at the International College of the Cayman Islands have donated $600 to buy new books for three primary school libraries.

The fundraising project is part of a new community service venture at the college. Students went to the three schools – Savannah Primary, George Town Primary, and Bodden Town Primary – to donate the money and talk to the children about the importance of reading.

“This is an extraordinary gesture,” said George Town Primary PTA President Cheyenna Stewart. “I was in the middle of ordering more books for the library and this contribution from ICCI students came just in time.

ICCI Student Council member Kimberly Martin made the check presentation to George Town Primary.

At Savannah Primary School, students gathered in an assembly to receive the contribution.

Billed as “ICCI Gives Back,” the ICCI Student Council meets quarterly to discuss how ICCI students can provide meaningful service to the community.

“We really encourage our students to be involved with service at ICCI because it is part of our mission,” said college president David Marshall.
