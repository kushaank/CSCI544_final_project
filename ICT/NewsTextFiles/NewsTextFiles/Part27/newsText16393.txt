
SUFFERN -  A 26-year-old Haitian student who moved to the US to finish his studies after surviving an earthquake graduated from Rockland Community College today.

Ralph Gedeon was taking classes at a Port au Prince engineering school when a massive earthquake rocked the island nation on Jan. 12, 2010.

His US sponsor, Ayal Lindeman, met Gedeon while working as a disaster relief nurse in Haiti.  The Spring Valley resident says Gedeon was seriously injured after being buried for days in the rubble and had to have his leg amputated. He added that Gideon decided to die and succumb to his injuries rather than be an amputee in Haiti.

Lindeman called a doctor back home who promised to give him a new leg.  He then brought Gedeon back to the states where he started attending Rockland Community College.  He is on his way to fulfilling his dream of becoming an engineer.
