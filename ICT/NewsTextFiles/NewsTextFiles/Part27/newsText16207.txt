
MAIDUGURI (NIGERIA):  Traditional hunters armed with  homemade guns,  poisoned spears and amulets have gathered in their hundreds, eager to use their skills and what they believe to be  supernatural powers to help find nearly 300 schoolgirls abducted by Islamic extremists.

Some 500 hunters, some as young as 18 and some in their 80s, say they have been specially selected by their peers for their spiritual hunting skills and have been waiting for two weeks in Maiduguri, the Borno state capital to get backing from the military and get moving.

With Nigeria's military accused by many citizens of not doing enough to rescue the girls, the hunters demonstrated their skills to an Associated Press reporter on Sunday.

The men twirled knives and swords with dexterity, occasionally stabbing and cutting themselves with no apparent harm. They also trust amulets of herbs, cowrie shells, animal teeth and leather bracelets to protect them from bullets.

A spokesman for the hunters stopped short of actually criticizing the military. "We're not saying we are better than the soldiers, but we know the bush better than the them," said Sarkin Baka.

A military spokesman did not immediately respond to an emailed question from AP on whether it would take advantage of the hunters' local knowledge.
