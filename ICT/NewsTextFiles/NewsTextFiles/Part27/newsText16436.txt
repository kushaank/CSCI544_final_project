US Vice President Joe Biden will be visiting Romania and Cyprus from May 20-23 to discuss several issues, including the international community's response to Russia's "illegal military intervention and destabilizing actions in Ukraine." A senior administration official told reporters on background that Biden's upcoming trip to Bucharest and Nicosia "is first and foremost about strengthening our bilateral ties with two key European partners and about consulting with them on the latest regional developments, including the continuing challenges presented by Russia's destabilizing actions in Ukraine." The official added that Biden is making these trips "all as a way of showing the United States' continuing solidarity and growing partnership with all of our European partners at a complicated and challenging time in Europe." On his visit to Romania, the official affirmed that it will "be an opportunity for the vice president to discuss with Romania's leadership their ideas on how Romania can play a pivotal role in European energy security, contributing to a diversification of supply and helping to reduce Russia's capacity to wield energy as a weapon against its neighbors." Biden is expected to meet in that country separately with both the president and the prime minister where he will "want to consult with both leaders on how we can continue to closely coordinate our response to destabilizing Russian actions in Ukraine."
