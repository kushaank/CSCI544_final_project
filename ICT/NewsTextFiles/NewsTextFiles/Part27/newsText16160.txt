
The United National Party (UNP) says the elections in India are an example on how a democracy should work. The UNP says democratic mechanisms to ensure the justness of the result, from the independent elections commission, to the police force, the judiciary and the media – all contributed to making the Parliamentary Election in India a cause for genuine celebration of the awesome power of democracy, when it works and works well.

A statement by the UNP today said that the people of India have spoken and spoken unambiguously. The opposition party says Indians have asked for change and new leadership to take the largest democracy in the world forward.

“Those of us in India’s neighbourhood are not only mere witnesses of this historic transition but people inspired by the glory of democracy truly in action. There are deep lessons in India’s recently concluded election, in the humility of its victors, the grace of the defeated, and most of all for all those in the region and across the world who seek to thwart democracy and electoral fairplay, systematically undermine democratic institutions in their countries, abuse Government resources and oppress the free press. There is no greater tragedy in a democratic nation than the erosion of long-standing traditions to protect the peoples’ sovereignty and right of franchise,” the UNP statement added..
