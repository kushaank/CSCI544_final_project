A senior administration official told reporters on background that Biden's upcoming trip to Bucharest and Nicosia "is first and foremost about strengthening our bilateral ties with two key European partners and about consulting with them on the latest regional developments, including the continuing challenges presented by Russia's destabilizing actions in Ukraine." The official added that Biden is making these trips "all as a way of showing the United States' continuing solidarity and growing partnership with all of our European partners at a complicated and challenging time in Europe." On his visit to Romania, the official affirmed that it will "be an opportunity for the vice president to discuss with Romania's leadership their ideas on how Romania can play a pivotal role in European energy security, contributing to a diversification of supply and helping to reduce Russia's capacity to wield energy as a weapon against its neighbors." Biden is expected to meet in that country separately with both the president and the prime minister where he will "want to consult with both leaders on how we can continue to closely coordinate our response to destabilizing Russian actions in Ukraine." The vice president's visit to Nicosia "is part of an effort to continue to cultivate our growing bilateral partnership which includes cooperation to remove chemical weapons from Syria, nuclear nonproliferation, counterterrorism and crisis response." Biden will have a bilateral meeting with the President Nicos Anastasiades, where it is expected that the two leaders will discuss "ways we can strengthen our bilateral cooperation to bolster regional security and prosperity." Biden will "recognize Cyprus for its regional leadership in supporting the mission to eliminate chemical weapons from Syria. He will discuss the trans-Atlantic community's response to Russia's illegal intervention and destabilizing actions in Ukraine, and of course, he will also discuss the settlement negotiations process," according to the official.
