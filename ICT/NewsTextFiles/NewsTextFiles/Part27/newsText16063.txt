HUMBLE, Texas -- A mother who was so drunk as she walked with her 1-month-old baby that she caused the infant to fall out of a stroller near a busy street plead guilty Monday, according to Humble police.

Sandra Grohman, 29, plead guilty to endangering a child and was sentenced to 180 days in jail.

A concerned citizen called authorities on April 22, 2014 to report that the mother, who appeared to be intoxicated, was pushing a stroller in the 1200 block of S. Houston Ave. about five feet away from a busy roadway. The witness said the mother had fallen over, causing the baby to fall out of the stroller.

When officers arrived, they determined Grohman was intoxicated. They had the baby checked out by EMS at the scene.

Her baby was released to Childrenâ€™s Protective Services.
