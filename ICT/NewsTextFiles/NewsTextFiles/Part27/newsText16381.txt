THE Newcastle Alliance will co-operate with the Independent Commission Against Corruption's investigation into developer donations made in the lead-up to the last state election, the organisation said yesterday.

It follows revelations that former billionaire Nathan Tinkler gave the group $50,000 for an anti-Labor advertising blitz.

The evidence led to the resignation of at least one director last week.

Hunter Business Chamber chief executive Kristen Keegan said she was deeply concerned to learn of this situation and had resigned from the organisation.

"I was not aware of or involved in organising funding for this campaign," she said.

Other board members have told the Newcastle Herald they would be seeking further information about the donations before deciding their future with the group.

A statement issued on behalf of Newcastle Alliance members yesterday said the board was aware of evidence given in recent ICAC public hearings about the donations.

"The board has supplied information and has written to ICAC offering its full co-operation in its investigation of these matters," the statement says.

"Therefore, complying with the ICAC rules, the board will be making no further comment until the commission's findings in this matter are released."

The statement also says the group is an apolitical, not-for-profit organisation dedicated to the economic, social and environmental advancement of Newcastle.

"Members of the Alliance are volunteers who share that objective," it says.

"Currently, for example, the Alliance is supporting efforts to attract more funding for the renewal of the city centre from the long-term lease of the Port of Newcastle."
