Maale Adumim Mayor Benny Kasriel on Monday handed a petition over to Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, demanding that his government give the green light to construction in the E1 corridor between Jerusalem and his city.

The petition was signed by dozens of MKs and ministers, including most members of the Likud in the Knesset, as well as hundreds of activists and members of the Likud central committee.

Israeli plans to build in the E1 area, between Maaleh Adumim and Jerusalem, has been the subject of sharp criticism by the Palestinian Authority and Western countries. According to the PA, an Israeli neighborhood in the area would cut off Bethlehem from Ramallah, destroying the possibility of a unified PA state with territorial continuity.

It should be noted that the lack of continuity between Jerusalem and Maaleh Adumim, one of the settlement blocs that all recent Israeli governments have said would be retained regardless of the outcome of negotiations, has not been addressed by the PA, the US, or the Quartet.
