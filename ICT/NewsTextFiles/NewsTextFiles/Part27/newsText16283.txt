
Scientists at Colorado State University say the number of miller moths migrating through northeastern Colorado this spring is expected to be well above average.

The Denver Post reports this year's moisture and plenty of flowering plants created good conditions for the moths during their larvae cycle. The moths are expected to start migrating through the northern Front Range at the end of May or the beginning of June.

Miller moths don't reproduce or lay eggs during their migration, but they can become a nuisance if they make their way into homes.

Some flowering plants - especially lilacs, cherries, spirea and cotoneaster - may attract larger numbers of moths.

Residents in southeastern Colorado will have less to worry about because drought conditions there are expected to result in fewer moths.
