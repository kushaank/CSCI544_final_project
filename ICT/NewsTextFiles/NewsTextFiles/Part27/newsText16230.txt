
SPRINGFIELD, FL--  On July 6th, Springfield's moratorium, banning homeless shelters, will expire.

City commissioners say they want to replace it with an ordinance making the same ban permanent. At the time of the original moratorium, the Panama City rescue mission's Bethel Village for women was planing a controversial expansion.

After losing a lawsuit against Springfield, Bethel Village moved into Panama City.

"It was actually a blessing in disguise, we were able to expand our program, to triple the square footage and double the capacity of beds. Which meant our original goal of getting woman out of this downtown campus into their own campus could finally come true," said Amanda Bawn of the Rescue Mission.

The ordinance would not create a ban that would blanket the entire city.

"With what we are proposing, there will be one little area in the city that allows them, and it's a swamp and  a protected wetland, so there is a need for a shelter, but not in a residential area," says Springfield mayor Ralph Hammond.

Commissioners did not vote on the proposed ordinance Monday, but say they will before the moratorium expires July 6th.

There are currently no active polls at this time.
