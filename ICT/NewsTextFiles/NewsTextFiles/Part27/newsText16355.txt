(TRNS) — A federal judge on Monday struck down the state of Oregon’s ban on same-sex marriage, saying such a ban is unconstitutional.

U.S. District Judge Michael McShane made the ruling, and said that the ban, approved by voters in 2004, violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and more specifically, the Equal Protection Clause.

“Because Oregon’s marriage laws discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation without irrational relationship to any legitimate government interest, the laws violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution,” McShane said.

The ruling becomes the most recent in favor of same-sex marriage. Seven other states have had their same-sex marriage ban struck down in recent months and are either pending appeal or are now the law of the land.
