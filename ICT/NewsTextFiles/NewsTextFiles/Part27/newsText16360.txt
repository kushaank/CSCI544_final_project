Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds, at podium, describes the upcoming Iowa Arts Summit while Gov. Terry Branstad and Director of Cultural Affairs Mary Cownie look on.

A summit happening early next month in Des Moines will allow arts professionals from across the state to meet and collaborate on improving cultural offerings and growing economic development.

Gov. Terry Branstad highlighted the June 6 Iowa Arts Summit during his weekly press conference on Monday morning, emphasizing the role arts and culture play in improving quality of life and attracting workers and businesses to Iowa communities.

"It will be a terrific opportunity for Iowans to learn and share ideas about the intersection of arts and the economy as well as discuss how to invest in rural and community development throughout our state," Branstad said.

The summit is sponsored by the Iowa Arts Council, and organized by the state's Department of Cultural Affairs. It'll be held from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on June 6 at the Community Choice Credit Union Convention Center in Des Moines.

In addition to the professional development and networking opportunities, the summit will include learning sessions, panel discussions, performances by Iowa artists and presentation of the Governor's Arts Awards by First Lady Chris Branstad.

Attendees may register until May 23 at www.iowaartssummit.com. The event costs $45 per person.
