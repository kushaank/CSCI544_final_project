
A case was registered against two office-bearers of a Delhi-based travel agency for allegedly duping another tour operator to the tune of Rs 1.8 lakh, police said today.

The case was registered at Pardeshipura police station here against the owner of Delhi-based Amazing Super Travels Time Ltd, Abhishek Rathi and its manager Arman.

The complaint was lodged by Dinesh Raghuwanshi, director of an Indore-based travel agency Fly Easy, who said that he had paid Rs 1.8 lakh to Amazing tours to book a packaged tour to Thailand for his customers.

According to the complainant, in order to book a packaged tour of Thailand for his 12 Indore-based customers he had paid the amount to Amazing Super Travels in three instalments between February and March.

The travellers were supposed to leave for Thailand on March 7. However, on March 5, Amazing Travels informed Raghuwanshi that they were unable to arrange air tickets for the group. After this, Raghuwanshi arranged for the air tickets and their hotel stay on his own and sent the group for their journey as planned.

However, Raghuwanshi suffered losses in the process and approached the Delhi-based firm to get his money back. Though they promised to pay him back, they failed to do so, following which he filed a complaint, police said.

A case was registered in this connection and further investigation is on.
