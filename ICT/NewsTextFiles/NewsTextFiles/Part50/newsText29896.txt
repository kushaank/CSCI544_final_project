
The Taoiseach said there will be a discussion on the homeless crisis at tomorrow's Cabinet meeting.

Enda Kenny said he accepts there needs to be an urgency in dealing with it, but it's not possible to provide homes overnight.

His comments come after Barnardos criticised the coalition for not seeing the urgency of families being put up in unsuitable accommodation.

"I hope that Government can demonstrateâ¦ a real response here where this matter can be dealt with," he said.

"I note the comments that up to five of six persons or families are becoming homeless on a daily basis. This is not sustainable and is not acceptable, and we've got to deal with it, and we will deal with it."
