A Private Member's Bill will be introduced on Wednesday to send a message that marine park legislation needs to be fixed.

A PRIVATE Member's Bill will be introduced to state parliament tomorrow by Legislative Council member Michelle Lensink to send a message to the state government that current marine park legislation needs to be fixed.

Ms Lensink said she had spoken with commercial fishing stakeholders about the impact of marine park sanctuary zones to gather a consensus about economic ramifications expected following the sanctuary zones implementation.

Ms Lensink said the rock lobster, abalone and sardine industries had been most concerned, and provided data about tonnages lost and the consequential economic losses.

She said she had also been in discussion with mayors, including Ceduna mayor Allan Suter.

Mr Suter said he had been hoping for two smaller realistic adjustments to be made to the marine park sanctuary zones.

However, Ms Lensink said the approach needed to be all in or all out when submitting a Private Member's Bill because they could not just make small changes.

She said the government was already aware of all proposals from the stakeholders, so the Bill needed to send a message to the government that marine park sanctuary zones need to be fixed.

The bill has been drafted by the parliamentary council, and will be introduced to parliament tomorrow for public consultation.
