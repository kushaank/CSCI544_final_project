
NORTH SIOUX CITY, SD - Voters in the Dakota Valley school district go to the polls tomorrow to decide that fate of a bond issue that would fund that new school.

The current high school opened in 1997, and bonds used to pay for that school will be paid off this year.

The polls are open tomorrow for those living in North Sioux City, Dakota Dunes, McCook Lake, and the Riv-R-Land Estates, Wynstone and Deer Run housing developments.

The current high school is only designed to hold 300 students. It already has 330 students this year, and it's projected there could be 400 by 2016.

"We knew we were getting crowded, the school is built for 300 and the high school has 330 right now, and our middle school has 404, so we know within a few years we're going to be over 400," said Dakota Valley Superintendent Al Leber.

The new school would be connected to the existing campus, and Leber believes it would also provide an added boost to the local economy.

"This area has been growing with a lot of new businesses moving in and one thing we know is a nice school, and a modern school will help economic development. People looking to move their businesses here, they want a nice school for their children, and I think this will enhance economic development in the area," Leber said.

The new facility would not raise property taxes for residents and it's designed to accommodate between 450 and 500 students. Since this is a bond issue, it will need 60 percent approval to pass.

If the measure passes, groundbreaking would begin this fall, with construction starting in the spring of 2015. Leber anticipates the school would be ready for the start of the 2016 school year.

The polls will open at 7 tomorrow morning and close at 7 tomorrow night.
