The loss of 500 mining jobs in the upper Hunter could have a flow-on effect on employment and retail in the Maitland area.

The loss of 500 mining jobs in the upper Hunter could have a flow-on effect on employment and retail in the Maitland area.

Steve Thomson.

Mining company Vale announced it would put its Integra coal mines at Glennies Creek and Camberwell near Singleton into care and maintenance mode last week, which has put 500 Hunter jobs on the line.

Maitland Business Chamber president Steve Thomson said ­substantial job losses could have a broad impact on Maitland’s economy, especially if those who became unemployed lived in the Lower Hunter.

“Every time a miner loses a job it forces a family to reassess their finances,” he said.

Mr Thomson said mining contractors were also at risk from any job losses in the Upper Hunter.

“If they [mining companies] are scaling back on employees then they would be scaling back on the suppliers and contractors they are using,” he said.

Mr Thomson said an increase in the number of unemployed in Maitland would mean more competition for jobs, which would make it tougher for people to find work.

Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union northern district president Peter Jordan said mine employees would be given formal notice about their futures on Friday.

He said CFMEU representatives would meet with the company tomorrow.

“Workers are angry and upset about losing their jobs,” Mr Jordan said.

“But people are also looking for clarity about whether Vale intends to resume production at the mines in the foreseeable future and under what circumstances.

“We will be seeking guarantees that if production is resumed at Glennies Creek and Camberwell after a period of care and maintenance, current employees are given first option on jobs.
