
DHANBAD: A local court on Monday awarded life imprisonment to a man for murdering his three sisters-in-law four years ago.

The court of additional district judge-VII Dhanbad NK Sinha held Sonu Kumar Verma guilty under IPC sections 342, 436 and 302 and also imposed a fine of Rs 60,000 on him.

On the night of December 7, 2010, Verma locked the servants' quarter of the PHED guest house near Dhanbad Circuit House where his three sister-in-laws Usha Devi, Tina Devi and Rina Kumar were sleeping. He then poured petrol inside the room through the windows and set it on fire, killing the three women alive. Charred remains of the trio were recovered next morning.

The victims' family members had alleged that Verma had fallen in love with his younger sister-in-law Rina and wanted to marry her too. However, when Rina's marriage was settled with another person, he killed them, they alleged.
