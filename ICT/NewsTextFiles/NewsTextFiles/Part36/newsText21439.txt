
Senior BJP leader Kalyan Singh today demanded resignation of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav asking him to take moral responsibility for Samajwadi Party's debacle in the Lok Sabha polls.

"Talking of morality, it does not hold any meaning for Samajwadi Party. People's mandate went against them. Therefore on principle, Akhilesh Yadav should resign and seek a fresh mandate from the people," Singh told reporters after he met RSS functionaries.

The BJP leader criticised the SP-led government calling it virtually "non-existent" and asserted that people have given a clear mandate exuding confidence in his party forming the next government in the state.Â Singh alleged that SP indulged in booth capturing in Kannauj and Firozabad constituencies, where the party secured its two parliamentary seats and also noted that BSP and RLD failed to get a single seat in the state.
