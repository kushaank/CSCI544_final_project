
The Prime Minister says New Zealand spies didn't supply information to the Americans on the Kiwi who was killed in Yemen by in a drone strike last November.

But John Key says Daryl Jones was attending an Al Qaeda training camp and was certainly known to the authorities.

"We had a warrant on him. How much of that information was shared with our five eyes partners, I don't know the full extent of that.

"But I know none of the information that we gathered was used for the particular drone strike that killed him."
