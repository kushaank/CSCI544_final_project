
TEHRAN (FNA)- Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said his government is determined to take positive steps to improve the country's economic conditions in various sectors, and stressed that the current Iranian year (started March 21, 2014) should be the year of economic prosperity.

"This year should be the year of economic prosperity in the country," President Rouhani told reporters after his meeting with Iranian Roads and Urban Development Minister Abbas Akhoundi and his team of deputies here in Tehran on Monday.

The Iranian president noted that the roads and urban development ministry plays a major role to this end, as it can create jobs and bring about changes by preparing the necessary infrastructures.

The Iranian president pointed to the need for the expansion of the country's railway network, and said, "We should work on linking the country's railway network to the neighboring countries."

President Rouhani said among the moves that the ministry can make to help advance towards the goal of economic prosperity is construction of double-track railways and electrifying them as such projects will help link Iran's railway network to the neighboring countries.

The Iranian president pointed to the status quo of the country's passenger air fleet, and said, "The number of passenger seats on Iranian planes is not sufficient and we should work to strengthen this sector and renovate the air fleet."

Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Khamenei in a message on the occasion of Nowruz on March 21 called the new Iranian year as "The Year of Economy and Culture with National Determination and Jihadi Management".

Last month, President Rouhani underlined that his government plans to increase its support for the agricultural sector in a bid to pave the ground for the country's economic boom and independence.
