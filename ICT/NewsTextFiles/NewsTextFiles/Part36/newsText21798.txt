
Preliminary results announced by Iraq's election commission on Monday indicated that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's coalition has won the most seats in parliamentary elections, but fell short of a majority.

The results showed that Maliki's State of Law alliance secured 92 of the 328 seats in the Council of Representatives. This indicates that the incumbent has a chance of retaining his position if he manages to form a government with the support of other political parties.

State of Law came first in 10 of the eighteen provinces, while its two main Shiite rivals, Ammar al-Hakim's Muwatin and the Ahrar movement loyal to Moqtada al-Sadr, managed to get a combined total of 57 seats.

While the Mutahidoun bloc led by the Sunni Arab Speaker of Parliament, Osama al-Nujaifi, secured 23 seats, former Prime Minister Iyad Allawi's Wataniya coalition won 21 seats, and Sunni Arab Deputy Prime Minister Saleh al-Mutlaq's Arabiya coalition got 10 seats.

Incidentally, the April 30 parliamentary polls were the first to be held in Iraq after the withdrawal of US forces from the country in 2011. More than 9,000 candidates and 276 political entities contested in the polls.

The Independent High Electoral Commission (IHEC) revealed Monday that about 62% of the 22 million eligible voters had participated in the polls, which the US Embassy in Baghdad said was "a testament to the courage and resilience of the Iraqi people, and another milestone in the democratic development of Iraq."
