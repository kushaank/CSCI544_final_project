Several journalists were waiting outside Stalin's residence here to gather news about his purported resignation as the party's treasurer.

Expressing regret over the attack on the media persons, DMK organising secretary T.K.S. Elangovan said the party cadres "could have misunderstood the comments of media persons" and attacked them.
