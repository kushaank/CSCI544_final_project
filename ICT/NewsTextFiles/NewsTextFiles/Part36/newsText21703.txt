
An Iranian professor is publicly criticizing the Ayatollahs’ rhetoric  on Israel, asking who entrusted them to destroy the Jewish state, Al Monitor reports .

“I don’t know who entrusted Iran with destroying Israel, Has the United Nations given this mission to Iran?” he asked.

According to the Iranian Students’ News Agency, the issue of Israel was raised as Zibakalam addressed the pressure and sanctions Iran has faced over its nuclear program.

He also criticized the fact that during the eight years of Ahmadinejad’s presidency, “The smallest criticism of the conservatives’ nuclear policy was not allowed.” He added, “There was no right to print an article on the nuclear program” under Ahmadineajd but today, under Rouhani, conservatives “easily criticize our nuclear policy and write articles, and recently held a conference” against it.
