
GURGAON: Major roads in the city have been transformed into parking spots as people haphazardly park their vehicles in the middle of the road despite the  No Parking signages. The roads include Gurgaon-Pataudi Road, Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road, Sohna Road, New Railway Road, Old Railway Road, Mehrauli Road and the Bus Adda Road.

When TOI contacted MCG commissioner Praveen Kumar regarding the issue, he said that there is no concrete plan as of now to check this. "As of now, we do not have any plan of action to act upon it. We are still to understand which roads need to freed of encroachments. But, whenever it is brought to our notice we act upon it," said Kumar. Amit Sheokand, head of the MCG enforcement wing said that he is unaware of the situation. "We keep conducting regular patrols and demolition drives whenever it is needed," said Sheokand.

A commuter who uses the Old-Delhi Gurgaon road on a daily basis told TOI that people park their vehicles in such a manner that it is hard to even find space to walk the roads.

"It is true that city roads are clogged with shops and illegal encroachments that are playing havoc with the traffic, we are yet to devise a plan to look into the matter," he said.
