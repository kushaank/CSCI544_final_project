
Many brokerages have upgraded their yearend targets for the domestic equity indices post Narendra Modi’s thumping election win.

Nomura’s equity strategists Prabhat Awasthi and Nipun Prem have raised their December-end Sensex target to 27,200 from 24,700, offering a potential 10 per cent upside from current level. Gaurav Dua, research head at Mumbai brokerage Sharekhan, has raised Nifty target to 8,000. Nirmal Bang Securities has pegged it at 28,000 for Sensex and 8,500 for Nifty.

Edelweiss Securities has raised its Sensex target to 29,000 and Nifty target to 9,000.

Deutsche Bank projects Sensex to touch 28,000 by December. Gaurav Dua, research head at Mumbai brokerage Sharekhan, has raised Nifty target to 8,000 (from 7,203 now).

Nirmal Bang Securities has pegged it at 28,000 for Sensex and 8,500 for Nifty.

Foreign brokerages UBS and Macquarie have raised their Nifty targets to 8,000 and 8,400, respectively.

Sanjeev Prasad, head of research at Kotak Institutional Equities, says at 15.9 times FY2015E free-float Sensex EPS and at 15.6 times FY2015E free-float Nifty EPS, the  valuations are fair, unless there is a faster-than-expected recovery in economic growth and strong earnings upgrades.

A progressive economic agenda and some pragmatic steps to improve India’s GDP to above 7 per cent on a sustainable basis through a combination of executive and legislative measures can keep stock valuations elevated.

Nomura economist Sonal Varma has pegged FY15 GDP growth at 5 per cent but revised it to 6.5 per cent from 5.7 per cent for FY16. “The Indian economy is at an inflection point. We expect exports and investments to drive a growth recovery from 2015 onwards,” she observes.
