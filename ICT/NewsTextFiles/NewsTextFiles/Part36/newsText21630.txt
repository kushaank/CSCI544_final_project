
Local election candidate Stephen Egan says that with the new charges on water being introduced, it time for a  debate on whether or not flouride should be added.

“As the government is now making us pay for our national water we as customers should have the right to decide if we want to have Fluoirde in our water or not. Cork County Council recently called on the government to stop its fluoridation programme under a proposal by Fianna Fail councillor Chris O’Sullivan.

“I think there is a real ethical issue here concerning the right of the government to medicate the people of the country without their permission.  As an individual I want to have the right to choose to take a medicine or not, that option is clearly not been offered to the Irish people at the moment and that needs to be addressed.
