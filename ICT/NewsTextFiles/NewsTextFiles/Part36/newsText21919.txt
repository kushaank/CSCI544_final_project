
The threat of non-traditional security has risen in the 21st centry. Asia becomes an active zone of "three forces": terrorism, separatism and extremism. And terrorism has been one of the biggest threat to all Asian nations. Dealing with terrorism is set to be an important issue at the Fourth Summit of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia this year.

According to a UN report, about 9 thousand people died in terror attacks or clashes with terrorist organizations in Iraq in 2013. More than 18 thousand were injured. Iraq’s ambassador to China says the CICA conference is a good platform for Asian countries to deal with terrorism .

"Security, especially anti-terrorism is a challenge to all member countries. Terrorism is now a transnational issue. The summit this year will emphasize the importance of international cooperation in dealing terrorist threats." Iraqi Ambassador To China Abdu-Karim Mostafa said.

Israel's ambassador agrees -- terrorism is an international issue that requires international cooperation.

Chinese experts say a discussion of international terrorism at the CICA conference has to take into account different conditions in different countries.

"Each Asian nation has its own culture, religion and ideology. Personally I think we have to discuss specific anti-terrorism actions. Another problem is the pirates in Southeast Asia. How to strike them jointly will be a great challenge to the CICA." Li Wei with Chinese Institute Of Contemporary Int’l Relations said.

While experts suggest the member countries of the CICA may develop a consensus on a series of anti-terrorism measures, getting their governments to implement them is likely to be a tougher task.
