
After much speculation, Nitish Kumar, who put in his papers as the chief minister of Bihar, selected Jitan Ram Manjhi as the next CM of the state. Kumar submitted Manjhi’s name to Governor DY Patil on Monday evening.

Earlier, in the day, during the JD-U legislature party meet, it was decided that Nitish would select his successor. The now former Bihar CM had said that his decision to quit was not sentimental but a ‘hard political decision’.

After the meet, Bihar JD-U president Basistha Narayan Singh told newsmen that it was decided that Kumar would continue to lead the party and coordinate between the party and the state government. He said the legislators accepted Kumar’s decision to stick to his decision to resign with a heavy heart and authorised him to choose a new leader to head the JD-U government.
