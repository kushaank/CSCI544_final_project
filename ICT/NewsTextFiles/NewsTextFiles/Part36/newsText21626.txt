
A new chapter in the StorageCraft Technology Corporation success story began today when the company broke ground on its new corporate headquarters facility in Draper, Utah. The 125,000-square-foot facility is the first step in a major expansion for the backup and disaster recovery solution leader.

Since its founding in Utah in 2003, StorageCraft has become an international company and one of the most trusted names in the backup and disaster recovery market. The company's award-winning products are being used in more than a million computer systems and servers, with sales taking place on six continents. StorageCraft now employs more than 200 in the United States, Europe and the Asia/Pacific region, with 170 employees currently located in its headquarters facility in Utah. Once the new offices are open, StorageCraft plans to increase its headquarters staff to more than 400.

"This is an exciting time for StorageCraft as it continues to experience record growth," said Jeff Shreeve, co-founder and chief executive officer. "The company's success is due to products that are fast and reliable, strong relationships with our partners, and a talented workforce. Our first 10 years have been great, but we are looking forward to an even better second decade."

The new building, which will be developed and managed by Gardner Company and built by Jacobson Construction, will exemplify what StorageCraft preaches: backup and recovery. It will be LEED certified and utilize state-of-the-art systems for heating/cooling and power distribution and high availability, allowing StorageCraft to run uninterrupted in just about any failure or disaster.

"The new facility's state-of-the-art features and increased number of employees will allow StorageCraft to better serve its four-thousand-plus managed service provider partners and extensive network of value added reseller partners in their efforts to protect the data and systems of small and medium-sized businesses," said Scott Barnes, co-founder and chief technology officer.

Initially, StorageCraft will occupy 75,000 square feet of the new facility, with the ability to expand up to 125,000 square feet to accommodate an additional 200 employees to bring the total to more than 600. The building is expected to be completed in March 2015.

Signs of the company's success are not limited to North America. StorageCraft recently strengthened its presence in Europe with the opening of its new international headquarters in Cork, Ireland, in October 2013. The Cork office, which is currently adding positions, supports StorageCraft's network of master distributors throughout Europe and Asia Pacific.
