Dublin welcomes the international community of early stage investors to set the debate on the major topics challenging the industry today.

Over 350 delegates will participate in the EBAN Annual Congress, this year hosted by the Irish angel investors' federation HBAN.

The congress will take note of the industry's progress in Europe and will call for further involvement and action by its stakeholders. Investors and policy makers will be addressed in the actions and policies recommended by theÂ Startup Investors Manifesto, an investors' driven call to increase the European early stage investment market from 7,5 billion Euros today to 15 billion Euros in 2017, an investment growth which is expected to contribute with 1,5 million new jobs.

The subject of this year's edition "The Power of the collective: Business Angels, Seed Funds, Accelerators & Incubation Space" highlights the need to look for the early stage investment sector as a multitude of different but complementary players. Only together investors can respond to the market needs and simultaneously contribute to a more sustainable sector with more proficiency and successful exits to all.
