
KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday accepted the resignation of Moloy Ghatak, who was agriculture minister in her cabinet.

The CM has directed chief secretary Sanjay Mitra that she will be heading the agriculture department till a full-fledged minister is appointed, say official sources. The decision was communicated to governor M K Narayanan when the CM met him for over an hour on Monday afternoon.

Mamata had asked Ghatak to resign after Trinamool's shock defeat in Asansol at the hands of BJP first-timer Babul Supriyo. Ghatak, the Asansol North MLA, put in his papers on Saturday, but some senior leaders tried hard to pacify the CM, as Ghatak's resignation might send out the wrong signals in Asansol where civic polls are due in July. Also, leaders fear that it will put many others in the firing line.

According to sources, Asansol Trinamool candidate Dola Sen - a favourite of Mamata's - had complained that Ghatak and Asansol South MLA Tapas Banerjee had not cooperated with her during the Lok Sabha campaign. Ghatak's brother Abhijit, the district secretary Asansol Youth Trinamool Congress, was removed last week.

Tapas Banerjee is the brother-in-law of Darjeeling BJP MP Surinder Singh Ahluwalia, who defeated Trinamool's Baiching Bhutia. The loss of Darjeeling was embarrassing for Mamata. Some sources say that if action is taken against Banerjee, the BJP will lay out the red carpet for him.

Ghatak was one of the Trinamool leaders closest to Mamata when Trinamool was founded in 1998. He was law minister till 2012, when he was shifted to agriculture after the state faced a setback on the Singur land takeover bill. Sources say that Becharam Manna, who is minister of state for agriculture, may be given charge for the time being.
