
Árni Filippusson: Originally I think I wanted to do something creative that would also make me look intelligent.

I love both, and I love having the opportunity to do both. After being stuck in front of a computer checking various budgets in Excel, it is nice to go on location to do some shooting with a hand-held camera, working in the field. And after a while, I miss being at my desk, going through scripts and budgets, and having millions of meetings.

I am probably the best you will find doing both jobs at the same time in Iceland, but on the flip side, I am not able to be the best at both jobs, precisely because I am doing both jobs.

Definitely Either Way – my feature debut as a cinematographer – which we filmed far up in the Westfjords in 2010, during the crisis in the Icelandic film industry. We had an extremely small budget, around €45,000, but an enthusiastic crew, so we decided to shoot the film and trust we could raise money for the post-production later. People thought we were crazy, but it was a film where you invested everything you had to create something you really believed in. Everything worked out in the end, and Either Way travelled the world and was selected for more than 30 international festivals.

David and I met at film school, and we had an instant connection. We had the same ideas and ambitions: to create something great and be part of something extremely interesting. He is like a brother to me, my best friend and for sure the most reliable partner you can find.

We are in pre-production with an American feature shot in Iceland, which we will also co-produce. We also have a television series, Bragason’s Prisoners, set in a women’s prison, and a psychological action-thriller in development. Now, at Cannes, I hope to extend my co-production horizons, and it would be good to make some new connections and friends.
