
After being denied bail by the district and session court (Jodhpur rural) thrice and Rajasthan high court twice, Asaram had approached the Supreme Court with two separate petitions, including bail application and acquittal from the charges filed under from Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO).

Asaram has challenged the minor status of the alleged victim. Hearing of both the petitions was scheduled on Monday in the SC, but now the matter has been posted for hearing on July 3.

Asaram was expecting favourable response from the spex court in the POCSO petition, which would have delayed the cross-examination of the victim.

Earlier, Asaram had been panelised by the Jodhpur court for delaying the cross-examination of the victim.

Expressing strong displeasure over the tactics adopted by Asaram’s counsels to delay the cross-examination of the victim, the local court had closed the arguments of the defence after Asaram’s counsel withdrew himself from the case last week.

Meanwhile, Asaram’s Mumbai based lawyer urged the district and sessions court to review the decision regarding closing of Asaram’s argument.

The district court is likely to hear his petition on Tuesday.
