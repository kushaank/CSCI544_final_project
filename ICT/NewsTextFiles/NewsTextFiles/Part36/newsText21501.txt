
CHANDIGARH: Congress MLAs who failed to ensure the party's victory in their assembly constituencies during the Lok Sabha polls could face the wrath of party high command. They might be denied tickets for Haryana assembly elections due in October.

Of the 90 assembly segments, Congress candidates have performed badly in 52. The party has 44 MLAs and has support from six independent legislators and a BSP MLA.

Haryana Congress president Ashok Tanwar said on Sunday that party's performance in the constituencies represented by Congress MLAs would be one of the key issues in their appraisal. "And only then their names will be considered for party ticket," he added.

"We have already accepted defeat. But we are confident of making a comeback with fresh faces. Besides the party's performance, MLAs' acceptability in their areas, winnability or whether he is facing anti-incumbency are some of the issues which will be taken up at one-to-one basis. We have already announced to start our programme from May 27," he said.

Tanwar, who lost to INLD's candidate Charanjit Singh Rori, minced no words while blaming "lax and arrogant bureaucracy" in the state for party's defeat in the state. He said, "The bureaucracy and those at the lower ranks largely acted as agents of opposition parties. An amount of Rs 42 crore under MANREGA was waiting to be released. Similarly, the social pensions were not disbursed on time. And there were many projects which were sanctioned, but officers held back work on them,'' Tanwar added.

"We have already alerted the chief minister about bureaucrats. We will take up the issue with him this week," he said. Tanwar also admitted that infighting among Congressmen and almost negligible role played by frontal organizations and civic body members, too, took a toll on the party.
