The marketing investment is centered around the dedicated website for Catholic Pilgrimage ( www.holyland-pilgrimage.org ), including live streaming of the Pope’s visit and utilization of the most advanced online marketing tools, both on the web and on the various social media platforms. The marketing targets source countries for Catholic pilgrimage, such as the U.S., Brazil, Italy, Spain, Poland, Germany, and France.

In addition, last month the Tourism Ministry ran an online Instagram promotion in advance of the Papal visit, where contestants from around the world were asked to upload a 15-second video on Instagram, sharing why they wanted to visit the Holy Land. The winning video was uploaded by Gustavo Aldolfo Franco Picaza from Venezuela, and earned him a free trip to Israel.

Hundreds of journalists are expected to arrive from around the world to cover the Pope’s visit, and the Ministry of Tourism will be offering support and hosting services to them.

The Tourism Ministry, which invests in the maintenance and conservation of Christian sites on an ongoing basis, has invested tens of millions of shekels in recent years in the development and infrastructure of Christian sites, including, among others, the Yardenit baptism site on the River Jordan, the Sea of Galilee trail and promenade, Mount of Olives, Via Dolorosa, Ein Karem, and pilgrimage routes in Jerusalem, Nazareth, and more. Improvements and upgrades in the area of Rachel’s Crossing and at the Room of the Last Supper that had been planned for later in the year have been carried out in advance of the Pope’s visit.

As a result of the visit to the Holy Land by Pope Francis, the Ministry estimates an increase of tens of thousands in the numbers of Christians visiting Israel. Christian tourism, which accounts for approximately 60% of all incoming tourism, is expected to increase by about 10% in 2014 as a result of the Pope’s visit.

TO RECOGNIZE THE ILLS YOU ,YOUR CHURCH, YOUR ANCESTORS YOUR PEOPLE THIS VERY DAY.

The ‘ONE G-D OF ALL THINGS OUR CREATOR’ I AM SURE ACCORDING TO THE PROPHETS AND ‘HIS’ TORAH IS APPALLED AT YOUR VIOLATIONS TO THE ‘HIS’ 2nd COMMANDMENT.

JEWS ”MUST SEPARATE NOT INTERGRATE.

and this alone is PROOF that ‘HASHEM’ IS RIGHT!

‘ISRAEL MUST SEPARATE FROM YOU SO WE DO NOT LEARN YOUR WAYS.

“APPALLED” first used in 14Th century origin is latin.

the word representing a horrible time for Jews at the hands of the rome/xtians and all other conquering tribes… the barbaric europe.

yes we are all appalled at you.

WHICH MEANS YOU ARE BLIND AND YOU HAVE NO RESPECT FOR ISRAEL AND JUDAISM.

but you have learned nothing what is a Jew!

Thats not true most Jews in Israel do not want the pope to come.

At least 2 million Jews (the religious), about anothet million Nationalist, as well as half a million Jews who want Israel to be Jewish. 3.5 million Jews. Additionnally most Muslims find the pope repugnant and a symbol of idol worship.

The pope is coming for those who have sold out Israel’s Jewish values.

We don’t love or want the pope here.

He is an Idol worshipper and an antisemite.

SPIRITUAL IMPURITY COMING THE THE HOLY LAND.

How the Jews will rectify the tumah is through extra prayer to rid the evil that comes with this vatican poop.

he already said not to pay attention to abortion contraceptives homosexuality and the pedeophile in vatican is well know….

how will he return the confused the lost the dazed Jews that converted to bow to an idol of a mangod.

TODAY all the xtians do is dress like RABBIS,BUILD CHURCHES TO LOOK LIKE SHUL AND DECEIVE INNOCENT JEWS TO CONVERT ACCEPT their deadmangod and still be JEWS.

spiritual filth on t he holy land to add to the filth of the crooked politicians  the drugs prostitutions gangster slave trades etc etc etc.

the poop first ”deed” he should do is STOP THE MISSIONARY ACTIVITIES IN ISRAEL AND ALL OVER  THE WORLD…but they cant..

they need JEWS  to bring their deadman to life again.

what happened to the jeusx mantra “people in glass houses shouldnt throw stones….

“Derech Eretz” applies to *us* – the Jews.

You might want to follow the rules and precepts that apply to Jews before demanding that others be “holier than thou”.

Your anger is something ! Wow.

YOU ARE CONFUSING DERECH ERETZ WITH A RASHA.

experience with eyes wide open.

your blindness, your tolerance, your Jstreet mentality with rachel corrie and abbas and AND INTERFAITH DINNERS MEETINGS LOVE FESTS AND EVENTUALLY THE ERADICATION OF TORAH JUDAISM..you are a whole basket of wonders.

BUT WITH EVERY  NEGATIVE HASHEM GIVES A POSITIVE.

LEARN THE LAWS ON DEUT.

and certainly not from jeusx.

liberalism is a sickness a decease and a destroyer.
