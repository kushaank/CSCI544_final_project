
Mr Reddy said he offered "issue-based support" to Mr Modi, though "he doesn't need it." Mr Modi led the BJP to a parliamentary majority, so it is not dependent on allies or regional parties. Mr Reddy also said he asked Mr Modi to be generous in financial assistance to Andhra Pradesh.

A recent Faceboook post byÂ  Mr Naidu's Telugu Desam Party or TDP, says, "It is beyond doubt that he (Jagan Mohan) is going back to jail in 45 days." On Sunday, Mr Naidu said, "The law must take its own course... I don't have a grudge against anybody."

On June 2, the state will be formally divided into two states - Telangana will be carved out as India's 29th state, and the two regions of Seemandhra will form the downsized residuary state with Mr Naidu as chief minister.

In 2012, Mr Reddy was arrested and spent 16 months in jail before being granted bail. The CBI says that his father, Congressman YSR Reddy, who died while chief minister in 2009, forced entrepreneurs to invest in his son's vast business empire.

Mr Reddy has blamed the CBI investigation as an ineffectual attempt by the outgoing Congress-led to curb his growing influence in Andhra Pradesh.
