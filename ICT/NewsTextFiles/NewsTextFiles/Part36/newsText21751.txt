
MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Governor Scott Walker frequently touts all he has done for Wisconsin's veterans since taking office more than three years ago as he runs for re-election.

But some veterans say Walker's refusal to pardon a decorated Iraqi war veteran and the governor's support for legislation they oppose show he doesn't have their true interests in mind.

Jason Johns is an Iraqi combat veteran, Republican lobbyist for veterans groups and a former deputy secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs under Walker.

He says veterans who previously wouldn't think twice about voting for Walker now aren't so sure, in part because of a law Walker signed affecting lawsuits brought by veterans exposed to asbestos.

Walker defends his record, saying his priority has been putting the needs of Wisconsin's veterans ahead of politics.
