
The funds are close to buying control of the web directory company for NIS 100 million.

FIMI Opportunity Funds (FIMI) and Sky Fund are in advanced talks to acquire joint control of Dapei Zahav Ltd. (Golden Pages) from institutional bodies for about NIS 100 million, sources inform "Globes."

In recent weeks the two private equity funds have held joint talks with the institutional investors that hold all the shares of the website directory company which was involved in a debt settlement in 2009.

If the deal comes to fruition this will be the first time that Ishay Davidi's FIMI has worked together with another private equity fund. In addition, Dapei Zahav will become the first Internet company in FIMI's portfolio which focuses mainly on industrial enterprises.
