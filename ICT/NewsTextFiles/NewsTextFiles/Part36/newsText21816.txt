
Orbach: Israel Deserves a 'Presidential Mentsch'

Uri Orbach (Jewish Home), Minister for Elderly Affairs, said that he has been working to elect Likud MK Ruby Rivlin to the post of President. Rivlin, said Orbach, was a “mentsch,” using the Yiddish term for “decent human being,” and Israel needed, and deserved, just such a person.

Earlier, MKs decided that elections would be held on June 10. Candidates are now free to announce their intent to run for the post, to replace Shimon Peres, whose term is set to expire by the end of June.
