
NATO does not see for now any signs of the Russian troops' withdrawal from the Ukrainian border, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said at a news conference in Brussels on Monday.

Rasmussen said that if the withdrawal of the Russian forces occurs, he would be the first to welcome such a development.

NATO has taken a double approach â€“ on the one hand, the Alliance has suspended almost all cooperation with Russia, on the other hand, it has decided to leave a channel open for political and diplomatic dialogue in the framework of Russia-NATO Council, Rasmussen said.
