
TEHRAN (FNA)- Syrian activists distributed the picture of a woman said to be from the Syrian province of Deir Ezzur where opposing terror militias have fought for control with a message for terror chief Ayman Al Zawahiri.

The message, which she carried in the picture, reads, "I am a Muslim woman from Deir Ezzur in Syria. You have killed my family and you bombarded my children with utmost brutality." The woman added that none of the people of Deir Ezzur would ever bow to radical Islamists even if it meant their complete annihilation, Islam Times reported.
