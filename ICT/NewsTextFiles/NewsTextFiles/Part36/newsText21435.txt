
Focusing on the dark underbelly of big cities, NGO Child Rights & You (CRY) rescued 14 children, who were forced to work at street-side pani puri stalls in Bangalore and sent home to Jharkhand.

According to CRY officials, the children heaved a sigh of relief only after the Hatia-Yeshwantpur express chugged its way into the crowded Ranchi platform.

â€œThe rescue of the children was carried out by the CWC in Bangalore and finally the children were handed over to a team of NGOs and the Jharkhand Police.
