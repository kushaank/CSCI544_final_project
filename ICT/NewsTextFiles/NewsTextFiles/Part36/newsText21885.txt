
Hundreds of demonstrators protest against Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni's visit to London and call for her to be prosecuted for war crimes.

Hundreds of demonstrators have staged a protest outside a London hotel where Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni was due to speak for the Jewish National Fund.

Jews protesting against Zionism and more than 200 pro-Palestinian demonstrators held the rally outside the Jumeirah Carlton Tower Hotel in southwest London on Thursday, chanting “Free, free Palestine” and “Livni war criminal”.

Rabbi Cohen, one of the protesters, told the Anadolu Agency: “We must to everything to stand against Zionism.

Protesters have repeatedly called for Livni to be prosecuted for her role in Israel’s 2009 Cast Lead Operation in Gaza, in which more than 1,400 Palestinians were killed - most of them women and children - during Israeli air strikes and troop incursions. Thirteen Israelis died in the conflict.

A woman who gave her name as Alice, from London Palestine Action, said: “It’s a disgrace that Livni has been allowed to speak today, especially since it is the day of the Nakhba [the 1948 displacement of Palestinians after the creation of Israel]."

“Livni should be prosecuted for war crimes,” she told AA.

Pro-Israel supporters, who were fewer in number than the protesters, held up placards, read out the Hamas charter and claimed that Israel was the only democracy in the Middle East.

He declined to give his name to AA.

The demonstration passed off peacefully with no arrests.

Earlier this week, the UK government granted Livni immunity so she could enter the UK without fear of prosecution for war crimes.

Livni played a prominent role as a member of the Israeli war cabinet during Operation Cast Lead in December 2008 to January 2009.
