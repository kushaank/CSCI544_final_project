
JERUSALEM—When Pope Francis arrives in the Holy Land on his “pilgrimage of prayer,” Israelis and Palestinians will both be looking to use the visit to score a few political points.

Although the Vatican has said the emphasis of the pope’s visit is to heal a centuries-old rift between the Catholic and Orthodox worlds, every gesture he makes is likely to come under close scrutiny by both sides.

For Israel, it will be a chance to draw world attention for something other than its ongoing settlement activity.

“The very fact of the visit is a success,” an Israeli official told AFP on condition of anonymity, as the tourism ministry said it was hoping the papal pilgrimage would drive a 10 percent increase in Christian tourism.

In fact, the pope’s “pilgrimage of prayer”, which begins in Jordan on Saturday, will leave a relatively faint footprint in Israel.

His visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories will kick off on Sunday in the southern West Bank city of Bethlehem.

“He is taking a helicopter directly from Jordan to Palestine -- to Bethlehem. It’s a kind of sign of recognising Palestine,” Father Jamal Khader of the Latin patriarchate in Jerusalem told journalists.
