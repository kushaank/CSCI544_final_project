
The UAE’s Federal Supreme Court has decided to consider the case of the nine nationals of different Arab countries who are accused of forming an AlQaeda branch cell, on  May 26 in order to hear the accounts of witnesses and the suspects themselves on the charges filed against them by the General Prosecution.

The General Prosecution referred this case on Monday to the State Security Department of the Federal Supreme Court after it filed the charges against the suspects.

The indictment accuses seven of the suspects of joining the terrorist Al Qaeda organisation, specialising in forming a branch cell of the organisation in UAE with the intent of promoting its aims and purposes, recruiting new members for it and for its branch Al Nusra Front which is fighting the Syrian government, despite their knowledge of its purposes.

According to the indictment, the suspects forced individuals to join Al Nusra Front and fight the Syrian government and raised funds for Al Nusra Front with the purpose of using them in funding terrorist acts outside UAE, despite their knowledge of the purposes, the indictment showed.

The General Prosecution accused the other two suspects of creating and running a web site for the Al Tawheed and Nusra Front Brigade to publish information on Al Qaeda, promote its ideas, recruit new members in order to send them to the fronts to join the fighting and perpetrate terrorist acts outside UAE.
