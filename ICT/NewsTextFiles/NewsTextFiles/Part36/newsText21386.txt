
ADEN, Yemen, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Two members of Yemen's Special Forces were killed and two others wounded on Monday in an ambush by suspected al-Qaida militants in the southeastern province of Hadramout, a local military official told Xinhua.

"The al-Qaida gunmen ambushed a patrol of the Special Forces in the Shihr area in Hadramout province at 1:00 p.m. local time (1000 GMT) today, killing two security personnel and injuring two others at the scene," the local military official said on condition of anonymity. The attackers fled after the ambush.

The official said the attack on Monday could be seen as retaliation for Yemen's recent operations against suspected al- Qaida strongholds throughout the country.

The al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), also known locally as Ansar al-Sharia, has vowed to hit back in Yemen's main cities, including the capital Sanaa.

The AQAP, which emerged in January 2009, is considered the most strategic threat to the Yemeni government and neighboring oil-rich Saudi Arabia.
