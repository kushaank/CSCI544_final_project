
Before congratulating him, PM and the AL government should learn the reason of the fall of the Congress--it was massive corruption! The way corruption is increasing in our country, AL may face the same consequence soon. We hope this government comes out of their weak, careless and corrupt administration in every sector and engage very strong and honest people in all sectors. At the same time, it should immediately arrest and punish the corrupt officials.

Let's celebrate 'democracy'. Modi has received the mandate of the Indians. And let's hope: democracy is secularism, secularism democracy.

I believe nothing has changed in India. It's not BJP that won the election, rather it's Modi who with his fierce communal outlook got the landslide. On the other hand, Mamata Banerjee got landslide in West Bengal. To me it's quite natural, for it's said that what Bengal thinks today, India thinks tomorrow. I had the opportunity to visit many parts of India. Other than West Bengal and a few states in South India, general members of the population are highly illiterate, orthodox and do not know about the basic hygiene (According to a recent report, more than 50% of Indian people do not use toilet). Therefore, it's obvious that the bulk of the populace would not understand the concepts like secularism, social development etc. However, West Bengal is spectacularly different with its rich literary and cultural background. The society is highly cosmopolitan and liberal. No wonder Tagore's message of love and humanism enriched not only West Bengal but gave a meaningful life to all Bengali speaking people in the Sub-Continent and beyond.

In India, democracy and the people won. In Bangladesh, democracy and the people lost in 5 January election.
