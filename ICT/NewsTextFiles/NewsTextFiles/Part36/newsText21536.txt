
New Delhi :Â It was a response many of his tense colleagues in the BJP would have wanted to make as they were accosted by journalists waiting outside party chief Rajnath Singh's residence. But only Shotgun Sinha had the panache to carry it off.

In his inimitable manner, the actor turned BJP member of Parliament drawled "Khaamosh (keep quiet)" when asked by reporters whether he had discussed a ministerial berth with the party chief, whose home he was stepping out of.

Mr Sinha was Health Minister in 2003-2004 in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.

Last June, when the BJP selected Mr Modi as its campaign-in-charge at a conference in Goa in June, Mr Sinha was among those who, along with chief dissenter LK Advani, skipped the event in protest.
