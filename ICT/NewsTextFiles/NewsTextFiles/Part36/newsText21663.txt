
BOSTON (CBS) – Interesting article in Sunday’s Globe about Secretary of State John Kerry, noting the contrast between the world view of a graduation speech he gave in 1966 to his senior class at Yale and what he told the graduates there this year.

OK, you never want people in power to have closed minds, and it would be troubling if Kerry thought the same way at 70 that he did at 23.

We know he talked tough about Assad and his chemical weapons last year, but settled for a deal brokered by the Russians that left Assad in power and still holding some of those weapons.

He cut a deal on Iran’s nuclear program that has yet to be proven sound.

And let’s not even talk about the Middle East.

1966 was a long time ago.

Please lose the nostalgia and just be the best 70-year-old statesman you can be.
