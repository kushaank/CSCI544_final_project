
WE should explain what just happened for people who are new to Ireland. The last few days must have been confusing. You are probably not used to an entire country wandering around semi-naked with a haunted look on our faces. This is what happens in Ireland when we get our first taste of summer.

You probably come from a country where things start to warm up in May and stay that way until the end of August. Lucky you. That's not how it works here. When we get three days of sunshine in mid-May, there is only one thought on our minds â€“ is that the end of our summer now? We are a cursed race, tortured by hope and then beaten down by 31 days of rain in July. That's why we wear a haunted look on our faces.

It's worse than ever this year. You might not have been around, but it was like Barbados here last summer. People barbecued their toast for breakfast, just because they could. There was talk that a guy down in Kerry actually got a proper tan. We know there is little chance of that happening again. The long-term forecasters agree. They are already saying 2014 will be a more typical Irish summer. Which is a nice way of saying you should probably go to Spain. So now you know why in some parts of the country people took off their clothes last week and knocked back bottles of cheap rose until it came out their ears. Trust us, if you hang around until next year, you'll do the same.
