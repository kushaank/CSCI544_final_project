
Islamabad: Reacting to the Bharatiya Janata Party's victory in the Lok Sabha elections, 26/11 mastermind and Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed has said that there is no longer a chance of improved relations with India. Addressing a gathering in Islamabad, Saeed said the recent election was won on an anti-Pakistan and non-secular agenda.

Saeed has also called Modi a tyrant. "Modi has come. Now, god willing, the illusion of friendship will be shattered. In fact it is already shattered," Saeed said.

"You cannot carry out this friendship any more; he (Modi) is going to show you another way. Everyone knows that the entire Indian election was contested on anti-Pakistan and anti-Islam sentiments," he added.

Addressing a gathering in Islamabad, the 26/11 mastermind said the recent election was won on an anti-Pakistan and non-secular agenda.
