
Controversial self-styled godman Asaram, who has been behind bars since August last year for allegedly sexually assaulting a girl, will have to remain in jail for now with the Supreme Court on Monday putting off hearing on his bail plea till July 3.

A bench of justices B S Chauhan and A K Sikri adjourned the matter and posted the hearing for July, after the court's annual summer vacation, on a bunch of petitions filed by the 75-year-old seeking bail and dropping of charges under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

Asaram has challenged the minor status of the alleged victim, claiming that she was born in 1995 and not in 1997, as stated by her father.

The Rajasthan High Court had earlier in February denied bail to Asaram in the case of alleged sexual assault of a minor girl in his ashram in Jodhpur.

The controversial spiritual guru has been lodged in the Central Jail in Jodhpur since his arrest in August, 2013.
