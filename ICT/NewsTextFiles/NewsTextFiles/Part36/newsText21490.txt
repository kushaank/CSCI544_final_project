
New Delhi: A Congress leader on Monday hailed the resignation by Nitish Kumar as Bihar Chief Minister in the wake of the drubbing his party Janata Dal(U) received in Lok Sabha elections.

Rashid Alvi, however, hastened to add that the move "should not be compared to the Congress party".

"I appreciate Nitish Kumar who has owned responsibility for his party's defeat and resigned. But we should not compare it with Congress party," he told.

Alvi's remarks came ahead of the Congress Working Committee meeting called to decide the future course of action following the worst-ever debacle of the party in parliamentary polls.
