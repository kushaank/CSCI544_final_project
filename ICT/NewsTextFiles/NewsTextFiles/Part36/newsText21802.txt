
A coalition led by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki won the most seats in the country’s first parliamentary elections since U.S. troops left in December 2011, paving the way for a third term for Mr. Maliki despite sharply escalating violence and political gridlock.

Mr. Maliki’s State of Law coalition won 92 out of 328 parliamentary seats in elections held in the April elections, three more seats than it won in 2010, according to the Iraqi High Election Commission on Monday.

But the results fell short of handing Mr. Maliki a decisive victory that would have allowed him to avoid months of political horse-trading to build a coalition among the country’s increasingly combative political parties.

The prime minister entered the April vote with few friends even among his Shiite coreligionists. But given Iraq’s highly sectarian political climate, Mr. Maliki will likely to turn first to Shiite politicians to form a government.

Among the other prominent Shiite parties, a list led by hard-line cleric Moqtada al-Sadr won 34 seats while the Iran-backed Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq won 31 seats.
