
The JD(U) has staked claim to form the government in the state under Manjhi, Kumar said.

Nitish Kumar on Monday picked Mahadalit leader Jitan Ram Manjhi to be Bihar’s new chief minister, after JD(U) MLAs gave in to his insistence on stepping down, and authorised him to choose their leader.

Manjhi, 68, MLA from Maqdumpur in Gaya, is Nitish’s SC/ST welfare minister, who came in third behind the BJP and RJD candidates at the Gaya Lok Sabha seat on Friday. He was not among the half a dozen leaders who were widely expected to succeed Nitish after he resigned on Saturday, taking “moral responsibility” for the JD(U)’s poor showing in the Lok Sabha election.

The Mahadalit constituency is a creation of Nitish, who put all Scheduled Caste groups other than Paswans in this tent. Mahadalits account for 12 per cent votes, and are a core Nitish constituency. The choice of a Mahadalit, which Nitish made in consultation with JD(U) national president Sharad Yadav, sends out the politically powerful message of the transfer of power from an OBC — Nitish himself — to an SC.

Among the names in the mix earlier had been those of Rajput leader Bashishtha Narayan Singh and the Bhumihar minister Bijay Choudhary, besides Bijendra Yadav, Narendra Narayan Yadav, and even Sharad Yadav himself. Nitish has pleaded to be relieved from chief ministership so he can work to strengthen the party after the election debacle.

An overwhelmed Manjhi thanked Nitish for the honour.
