
The Centre and Uttarakhand government on Monday assured the Supreme Court that all measures have been put in place to prevent a repeat of the scale and extent of the damages caused by excessive rain and flash flood in the state last year.

Appearing before a bench of justice BS Chauhan and AK Sikri, the two governments submitted that all arrangements have been made for this year's ongoing chardham yatra and they are closely monitoring to control any incident in the state.

The bench then turned down the plea of a petitioner seeking its direction to immediately stay the yatra and asked him to approach the High Court.

Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for the petitioner, contended the situation in the state is very precarious and more casualty is likely to take place in case of excessive rain and flash flood in the state.

Solicitor General Mohan Parasaran, however, refuted the contention saying all measures have already been taken to prevent a repeat of the extent of the damages caused by such incidents last year.
