
The single bench of Justice Prashant Kumar Agarwal dismissed Mohanty’s petition, saying that the charges facing him were serious and an investigation was still pending.

The counsel for Mohanty had in April filed for anticipatory bail but the court had reserved its judgment on May 13.

Mohanty’s lawyer contended that all allegations were false and anticipatory bail should be granted to his client.

The IAS officer was suspended by the state government after an FIR was logged against him on January 25, 2014 at Mahesh Nagar police station, Jaipur under section 341, 354, 376 of IPC.

His alleged victim is a 23-year-old woman.

The woman had claimed Mohanty raped her at an apartment in Swej farm.

The complainant hails from Uttar Pradesh and had alleged that Mohanty first raped her on February 19. She claimed he took her to a number of places over the next few months and sexually exploited her.

Among the places she claimed Mohanty took her were Bharatpur, Chennai, Goa and Udaipur.
