PHEK, MAY 19 (MExN): Businesses in Phek town shut shop today in protest against alleged “threats” meted to the business communities at Phek town by one Thupuvezo Keyho, Kilonser of the NSCN (K). The “total close down” was initiated by the Phek Town Chamber of Commerce and Industries (PCCI), along with the Phek Town Youth Society and ACAUT Phek Unit.

ACAUT Phek Unit had previously informed that the NSCN (K) Kilonser had passed an order to business communities in Phek town to boycott the ACAUT rally, which was held on May 15. When the rally was held, despite the order, ACAUT informed that the Kilonser “demanded a sum of Rs 10,000 and 5,000 as penalty from certain businessmen on May 17. It further alleged that “Keyho along with his bodyguard even went to the extent of assaulting the shopkeeper and threatened them with gun point.” “He also threatened the public leaders as to why they brought the ACAUT Nagaland team to Phek. He even tried to disrupt the rally but was stopped by the authority,” it added.
