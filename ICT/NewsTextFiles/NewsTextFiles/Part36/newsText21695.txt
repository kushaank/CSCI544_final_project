
Iranian Foreign Minister has said that reaching a final nuclear deal with world powers is still within reach.

Iran says its nuclear energy programme is for peaceful purposes.Â "Agreement is possible. But illusions need to go. Opportunity shouldn't be missed again," Zarif said on Twitter.

On 20 July, an interim deal, under which Iran curb uranium enrichment in return for the lifting of some Western sanctions, is due to expire.
