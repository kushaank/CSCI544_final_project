The Supreme Leader of Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei, has sent a message to the Thirtieth Annual Meeting of the Association of Islamic Students in the Indian Subcontinent. This is a group of Iranian Muslim students who are studying abroad.

 In similar remarks earlier in January, Ayatollah Khamenei called on the Iranian students in both local and foreign universities to strive to improve their knowledge and throw their weight behind the country’s progress to bring prosperity to their homeland.

 In his previous message to the Iranian students in Europe, Ayatollah Khamenei had referred to the Iranian young students abroad as “valuable plants” that have their roots in Iran. The Supreme Leader had also asserted that those Iranians studying abroad, like their peers in the country’s “lively and dynamic” universities, would “make valuable contributions” to the prosperity of their homeland and welfare of the Iranian nation.

Dear Youth and Students,

The promising outlook of your country’s future is pinned on an optimistic and hopeful attitude towards yourselves. Always have an hopeful and optimistic attitude. These two issues are inseparable. You are the valuable blossoms of the Iranian nation. Recognize yourself and your position properly to assure your role in the future. Seeking wisdom, knowledge and religious piety are key elements to realize your success in the future.

I am praying for you and send you greetings of peace,
