
Outside the auditorium, homemade goodies are for sale with volunteers manning the tables.

At the door to enter the auditorium, men of the congregation hand out price lists and maps to help shoppers find what they need. Members of the Beth Israel Sisterhood man the tables for checking out and bagging.

Donations come to the synagogue from congregants on the Wednesday before the event. Thursday and Friday are the set-up days and by Sunday morning they are ready to go. The sale runs Sunday; Monday is bag day when everything finds a new home.

Members de-clutter their closets every six months; shoppers come from all across the region to find bargains and the programs at Beth Israel realize important funding.

Volunteer Ilene Reich of Margate said the even dates back at least 20 years when the synagogue was still in Atlantic City.

Helping customers at the Beth Israel Sisterhood Thrift Sale are from left; Brooke Stromfeld of Linwood, Marilyn Alpern of Atlantic City and Marielle Indych, 15, of Galloway, all members of the congregation.
