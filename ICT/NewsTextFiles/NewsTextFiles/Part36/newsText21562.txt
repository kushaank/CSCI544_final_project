
AMMONNEWS -  Kazakhstan announced on Monday that it will name one of the main streets in the capital Astana after His Majesty the late King Hussein Bin Talal.

The move to name a key arterial road after the late King was to immortalize the memory of His Majesty for the stature he enjoyed among the Arab and international community, as well as his contribution towards establishing and nurturing mutual ties between Jordan and Kazakhstan.

Amman Mayor Akel Biltaji attended a celebration to mark this occasion while he was on a several day long visit to the country in response to an official invitation of his Kazakh counterpart Tasmagambetov.

During the visit, Biltajiâ€™s efforts were aimed at activating the twinning agreement between the cities of Amman and Astana in various areas of municipal services.

Jordan signed the twinning agreement under the patronage of His Majesty King Abdullah II and the Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev.

Jordan, too, named one of its streets in Tareq area in 2010 after the first president of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev, recognising his contribution in the establishment and development of fraternal relations between the Kingdom and the Republic of Kazakhstan.
