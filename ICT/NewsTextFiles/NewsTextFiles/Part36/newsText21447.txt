
NEW DELHI: Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, leaders of India’s defeated Congress party, offered to resign after last week’s election debacle, but colleagues rejected their gesture, a senior party figure said.

“They both offered to resign but the party rejected it unanimously,” member of parliament Amarinder Singh told reporters yesterday after a meeting of the Congress’s top committee in New Delhi.

The Press Trust of India reported that the Congress Working Committee passed a unanimous resolution “expressing full faith in the leadership of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul GanÂ­dhi”.

About a dozen supporters gathered outside the party’s Delhi headquarters, shouting slogans – “Rahul-ji, continue to struggle, we are with you” – during the 150-minute-long meeting.

The mother and son, members of South Asia’s most famous political dynasty, are facing unprecedented pressure from grassroots party workers and defeated ex-MPs over their failed campaign tactics.

Congress slumped to its worst poll result ever last Friday, winning just 44 seats in the 543-member parliament – less than a quarter of its tally in 2009 – as the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power with a landslide win.
