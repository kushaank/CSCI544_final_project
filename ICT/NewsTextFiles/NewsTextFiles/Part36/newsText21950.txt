
Motorola recently launched a new special edition of their Moto G model, the Moto G Ferrari Edition. Heard that Ferrari fans?  But here’s the catch, it will only be available in Mexico for now. Along with the luxury car brand version, the smartphone maker also launched the budget-friendly Moto E and Moto G LTE.

The special Ferrari edition will initially be available in Mexico for 4,999 pesos (about $ 387) without contract.  That is around $ 77 more than the Moto G LTE’s price. Apparently, the price difference is based on the ‘bragging rights’ that future owners will get to enjoy. The said edition will come furnished with a Kevlar weave design rear panel with a Ferrari crest and an iconic Ferrari logo at the front. The camera lens and grills of the speaker both flaunt a red highlight, giving the phone a more distinctive, sporty aura. Other perks include exclusive Ferrari content, which smartphone experts take to mean ringtones and wallpapers, in addition to a special range of Ferrari accessories that can be bought separately.

Phone reviewers commented that the distinctive black and red theme is a welcome deviation from the Moto G LTE’s utilitarian form and design. But it is also noticeable that Motorola seems to forget to include additional ‘horsepower’ to their luxury model. Inside the Moto G Ferrari Edition are specs which are exactly the same with the Moto G LTE. This means that the phone also comes with a 4.5-inch, 720p display, a 5-megapixel camera, Android 4.4 KitKat, and a quad-core, Snapdragon 400 processor running at 1.2 GHz. It is equipped with 16 GB of internal memory that is expandable up to 32 GB via a MicroSD memory card.
