
A photograph carried by Iranian media shows Hatami kissing 83-year-old Gilles    Jacob at the opening of this year's festival.

"Those who attend intentional events should take heed of the credibility    and chastity of Iranians, so that a bad image of Iranian women will not be    demonstrated to the world," Deputy Culture Minister Hossein Noushabadi    said, quoted by the website of state broadcaster IRIB.

"Iranian woman is the symbol of chastity and innocence," he added.    Hatami's "inappropriate presence" at the festival was "not in    line with our religious beliefs".

Born into a family with a background in cinema, Hatami gained worldwide fame    for her role in Asghar Farhadi's A Separation, which won the 2012 Academy    Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

She is on the jury this year at the annual Cannes festival in southern France    but lives in Iran.

According to Iran's interpretation of Islamic (sharia) law, in place since the    1979 revolution, a woman is not allowed to have physical contact with a man    outside her family.

Jacob has attempted to prevent the furore in Iran, explaining that it was "a    usual custom in the West."

"I kissed Mrs Hatami on the cheek. At that moment, for me she represented    all Iranian cinema, then she became herself again," Jacob tweeted.

"This controversy over a usual custom in the West has therefore no reason    to be."
