NEW DELHI: There's some good news for those looking to buy a top-end smartphone without spending half-a-lakh rupees.  Samsung Galaxy S5 is now available for less than Rs 40,000 in India, a drop of more than Rs 10,000 over its launch price.

Galaxy S5 was launched in India at Rs 51,500 and Samsung is still retailing it at Rs 51,500 at its online store.

But it is now available for Rs 39,925 at online marketplace Snapdeal.com. Under the online marketplace model, several retailers can sell the same product at different rates.

So, even though one retailer is selling Galaxy S5 for less than Rs 40,000, others are still pricing it between Rs 40,000 and Rs 42,000 on the same website.

This is a new low for the smartphone, whose price has been in a free fall since launch. Last week, the lowest price of Galaxy S5 was approximately Rs 42,500. The price of the device was Rs 47,000 just three days after it was launched in India.

In fact, less than a fortnight after the Galaxy S5 was launched, Samsung had issued a press release stating that the official price of the smartphone remained unchanged. This was done after its price had dropped on e-commerce sites by several thousand rupees.

Though Galaxy S5 is still priced at Rs 51,500 on the official India e-store, Samsung is running multiple offers to lure buyers. The company has a buyback offer on the smartphone till May 31, wherein it will cut the price by up to Rs 7,500 if the buyer exchanges an old handset.

Samsung India also provides vouchers worth Rs 5,000 to buyers who purchase the smartphone via its official e-store. These vouchers are only applicable on the Samsung India e-store.
