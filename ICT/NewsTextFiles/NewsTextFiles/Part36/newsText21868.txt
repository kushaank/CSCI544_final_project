A total of 826 people received medical treatment from Magen David Adom over the  two days of Lag Ba’omer bonfires at Meron that ended on Sunday night – some of  them seriously hurt and evacuated to hospitals in Safed and Tiberias.

The  toll was almost three times that of last year, even though in 2013, the holiday  began on Saturday night and was also continued through Sunday night.

The  injured suffered from burns, physical trauma, dehydration, excessive use of  alcohol, violence and other harm.

In addition, among those hurt in other  parts of the country, one man, about 30-years-old fell from the balcony of his  Tel Aviv home while celebrating the minor Jewish holiday.

Others suffered  from smoke inhalation, burns and other damage.

A 10-year-old Jerusalem  boy was hurt in his foot when a spray can was thrown into a bonfire and  exploded.

A couple near Safed who left their two-year- old toddler in the  care of a 15-year-old babysitter learned upon their return that the baby had  fallen into their swimming pool, which was not locked, and had nearly  drowned.

The toddler is in Rambam Medical Center after being  resuscitated, but the long-term implications of the injury are not known.
