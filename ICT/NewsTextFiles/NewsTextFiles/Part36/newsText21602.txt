
A man in his 40s will appear at Dublin District Court tomorrow to be charged in connection with a carjacking in Terenure in South Dublin last week.

A woman - and her two children - were in the car when it was hijacked at the junction of Zion Road and Orwell Road shortly before four o'clock last Friday.

The woman was forced to drive to her home to get her bank cards - and then to drive the carjacker to an ATM in Rathgar and withdraw money.

She was then forced to drive to Portobello where the carjacker got out.

Neither the woman, nor her children, were injured in the incident.

Meanwhile, in a separate incident, gardai are searching for four men who carried out a carjacking in County Wicklow this afternoon.

A German man and woman, who are on holidays in Ireland stopped to help at the scene of a road accident in Clara Vale.

One of the tourists - a woman - sustained slight injuries in the incident and has been treated in hospital.

The tourists' Mercedes has been recovered in Tullow, in Co. Carlow - and gardai are conducting a technical and forensic examination on it.

They believe the Volvo that was in the crash had been stolen and used in a burglary in Athy earlier today.

Gardai say that four men were involved in the carjacking and the suspected burglary.

Officers from Wicklow and Carlow are searching for them - along with the garda helicopter.
