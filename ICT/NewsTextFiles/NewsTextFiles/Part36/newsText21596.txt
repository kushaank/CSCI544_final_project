
A fisherman is recovering in hospital after being rescued from Lough Swilly, Co. Donegal yesterday afternoon, by a team of RNLI volunteers.

The man was rescued after a mother and her son heard his cries for help at around 1.50pm yesterday, and managed to guide a local fishing boat to his location. A man who had seen him from the beach meanwhile called the Coast Guard. The crew of the fishing boat found the manÂ freezing and clinging to a lobster buoy, and they pulled him aboard to safety.

RNLI crewmember Joe Joyce said, "This man was very fortunate that his cries for help were heard by the mother and her son at Tullagh. Once they raised the alarm, help was at hand within minutes. From the arrival of the local fishing vessel, to the fast response of the lifeboat crew and Coast Guard; everyone worked together to help the casualty. We wish him a full recovery from his ordeal and we thank all the members of the public who had such a vital role in this rescue operation."

The RNLI videoed the rescue, making the footage of their rescue available this morning.
