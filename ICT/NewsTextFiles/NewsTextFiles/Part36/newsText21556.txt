
There  had been speculation that party president Sonia Gandhi and vice  president Rahul Gandhi may offer to resign at the meeting but the party  has refuted reports that only Sonia and Rahul will quit over the  debacle.

"The question of Sonia and Rahul resigning does not even  arise. It's a collective responsibility. I am equally responsible,"  party leader Manish Tiwari said.

Kamal Nath, the most senior  Congress parliamentarian, told NDTV on Sunday that only internal  democracy could end "the culture of patronage" He added, Why blame Rahul  alone? He should not resign."

Party sources said senior leaders  are expected to speak frankly about shortcomings in the party's strategy  and election campaign.

They are also likely to convey their views on the performance of the United Progressive Alliance government at the meeting.

Though  there is talk in party circles on the need of fixing accountability for  the failure in the Lok Sabha election, there is no clarity on how it  will be done.

Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have owned up  responsibility for the party's performance and there are suggestions for  firm steps towards organisational revamp and ideological consolidation.

Congress  sources said there was a possibility of the role of some leaders  considered close to Rahul Gandhi coming under scrutiny.

The Congress could win only 44 seats against 282 won by the Bharatiya Janata Party in the general election.
