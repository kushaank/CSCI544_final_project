Their problem with Tehran is not even the Human Rights issues, because the western states have committed a lot of crimes in the world and the region, and this blocks any attempt that they may intend to make to find faults with the Human Rights situations of other countries. Hence, it is far from possible for them to reach a final deal with Tehran on its nuclear program since the western countries are not at odds with Iran over the aforementioned issues. Their hostility is rooted somewhere else and the nuclear and human rights issues are no more than an excuse.
