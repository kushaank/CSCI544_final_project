
Thiruvananthapuram: Drawing inspiration from the Kochi-Muziris Biennale, the district administration in Kerala capital is getting ready to turn the walls of public buildings here into canvas for artists.

Authorities have drawn up a plan to paint beautiful pictures on the walls of the city buildings, mostly the government offices, with the help of artists.

The project is also meant to preserve the traditional charm of the city, the walls of whose buildings are defaced by ugly graffitis and film posters, a top official said.

"The graffitis and wall posters have largely taken their toll on the beauty of heritage buildings in the city. Seeking to check this menace, we are planning to paint pictures on the walls of selected buildings here," District Collector Biju Prabhakar told PTI.

He said a panel of artists would be decided soon for executing the beautification project, which is already done by many cities in and outside the country.

Eminent artists like Kanayi Kunhiraman and B D Duttan have already offered support to the project, he said.

"The project is planned to be carried out with the support of state cultural and tourism departments. Sponsors will be identified soon for getting enough funds. We expect to launch the programme by Onam festival season (September)," he said.

The collector said it would not only help conserve the elegance of old structures in the city, but also provide a medium for the artists in the state.

The authorities have also plan to provide a permanent canvas on the compound wall before the Fine Arts College here.

Interested artists could seek permission from the authorities and draw whatever he or she wants on the space and it would be removed after one month to give chance for the another painter, he added.
