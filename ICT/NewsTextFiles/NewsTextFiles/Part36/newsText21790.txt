Thailand's Samart Corporation plans to export up to 500,000 of its I-mobile digital TV-enabled smartphones to the Middle East now that DVB-T2 based systems are being rolled out in the region.

Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iraq, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and Tunisia have all adopted the second-generation terrestrial Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) system.

State broadcaster Qatar Media Corporation selected Rohde & Schwarz in August 2013 to upgrade its terrestrial TV network to support DVB-T2 technology. Qatar-based systems integrator Media Group International is overseeing the US$14 million project, which is due to be completed later this year, according to Gulf Times.

Saudi Arabia and the UAE are also currently undergoing nationwide migration to DVB-T2 based digital terrestrial television (DTT) networks, while Kuwait has also committed to install the second generation standard. Iraq has already implemented its DVB-T2-based system in parts of the country, while Bahrain, Oman and Yemen are assessing the technology.
