
Orbach: Israel Deserves a 'Presidential Mentsch'

Uri Orbach (Jewish Home), Minister for Elderly Affairs, said he would do everything he could to get Reuven Rivlin elected president.

Uri Orbach (Jewish Home), Minister for Elderly Affairs, said that he has been working to elect Likud MK Ruby Rivlin to the post of President. Rivlin, said Orbach, was a “mentsch,” using the Yiddish term for “decent human being,” and Israel needed, and deserved, just such a person.

Earlier, MKs decided that elections would be held on June 10. Candidates are now free to announce their intent to run for the post, to replace Shimon Peres, whose term is set to expire by the end of June.

In Israel, the President is a figurehead position, and is elected to a seven year term by MKs. Other likely candidates for the post are Likud Minister Silvan Shalom, Labor MK Binyamin Ben Eliezer, and Nobel Prize winner Dan Schechtman.
