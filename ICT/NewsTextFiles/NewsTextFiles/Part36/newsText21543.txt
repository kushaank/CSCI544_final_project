
Jiten Ram Manjhi, the next chief minister of Bihar, on Monday thanked his predecessor Nitish Kumar saying only he could have thought of handpicking a Mahadalit for the top job. "I would like to thank Nitish Kumar for this. Only he could have thought of projecting a Mahadalit as the chief minister. We will continue to work under his able guidance," Manjhi said speaking exclusively to Zee Purvaiya.

Jiten Ram Manjhi has been a minister in the Nitish cabinet since 2008. He is a graduate and a constitutional expert. He is believed to be a close aide of Nitish Kumar. He was born on Oct 6th, 1944 in Khijarsarai in Gaya and entered politics in 1980. He has 2 sons and 5 daughters. He has been a member of Assembly from 1980 to 1990 and since 1996 till date.

Manjhi had resigned from the post of a cabinet minister within hours of swearing in in 2005. He was facing charges in the fake B.ed degree racket in 1990s. He was later re inducted in 2008 after having absolved from the charges.

On whether it would tough to deal with the present political scenario, Manjhi said since has been in the government for some time now he is aware of all issues and there would not be much of problem.

He also listed development of entire state as his priority.
