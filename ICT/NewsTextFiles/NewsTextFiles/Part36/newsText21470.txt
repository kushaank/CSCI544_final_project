
Even as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) mulls over forming a government with Congress support, an AAP rebel MLA seems to have found a solution to end the impasse. Expelled AAP MLA Vinod Kumar Binny, on Monday, said all political parties should give their consensus on making political activist Kiran Bedi the Delhi Chief Minister.

“Prior to the Delhi Assembly elections, Arvind Kejriwal offered to make Kiran Bedi the chief ministerial candidate if she gave support to the party. Sources in the BJP have also said they want Kiran Bedi as the Delhi chief minister. If both parties want the same person, why can’t they come to a consensus instead of forcing Delhi to undergo another round of elections,” Binny said.

Binny said he had written to AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee chief Arvinder Singh Lovely, Delhi BJP chief Harsh Vardhan and independent candidates on the issue.

Meanwhile, after a flip-flop on forming the government with Congress support again, AAP members seemed divided on the issue.

The belief that the AAP government’s resignation in Delhi had disappointed voters has led many in the party to believe that forming the government with Congress support would help the party.

And despite the top leadership being firmly against the proposition, several in the party feel that it would also help the capital avoid spending more money for another set of elections.

Others, however, feel the move will be a strategic blunder. “Any alignment with the Congress will be a bad move for the party. Even if the resignation was a mistake, forming the government again with Congress support will be a disaster,” another leader said.
