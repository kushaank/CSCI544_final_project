
A David Vs Goliath fight is scheduled to take place later tonight at Feroz Shah Kotla when Punjab Kings XI take on Delhi Daredevils, where Punjab is the Goliath and Delhi is David. Punjab has had a great IPL season so far with eight wins from ten matches. On the contrary, Delhi has been the worst team of the competition, where they have only won two of their eleven matches.

In spite of possessing good players, Delhi have themselves to blame, where their players have not been able to put up a good performance. They have failed in both the batting as well as the bowling department, hence their position in the competition.

JP Duminy has been their best bet as he has amassed 340 runs so far. But, other batsmen such as Kevin Pietersen, Dinesh Karthik, the two players whom Delhi trusted to excel, lacked consistency. In the bowling department, the less the said, the better. Nadeem has been their highest wicket taker with seven wickets and the rest does not even seem to exist.

The story is completely different in the Punjab camp, where they have been performing excellently well with both the bat and ball. Sandeep Sharma and Balaji have carried the responsibility of the bowling attack on their shoulders with 14 and 11 wickets. But, it is their batting, which has helped them attain top spot in the competition. They have chased down mammoth totals.

Much credit goes to Glenn Maxwell, who has been in red hot form scoring 517 runs so far, along with David Miller with 321 runs. Apart from these two, players such as Sehwag, Bailey and Pujara have also chipped in, making them a formidable side to compete against. No wonder, they have received the favourites tag as well.
