
Now in its 9th year, the Tel-Aviv International LGBT Film Festival (TLVFest) is one of the most important cultural LGBT events in Israel and will take place from June 7-16 at the Tel-Aviv Cinematheque, coinciding with Pride week. The above promotional video  stars the famous Israeli drag queen Nona Chalant and the Israeli actress, model and DJ Narkis Tepler.

Opening night, TLVFest will be screening the world premiere of the new Israeli feature GuttmanX5; five short films which have been inspired by the life and films of the first openly gay Israeli film maker Amos Guttman.

Amos Guttman was born in Transylvania, Romania and immigrated to Israel at the age of 7. He studied film at Beit Zvi and directed between 1977 and 1982 the three short films Drifting, A Safe Place and Returning Premiers. He created a rich, stylish cinematic language and his films were notable because of his attention to the visual and distinct content. Guttman also directed the feature films Drifting, Bar 51, Himmo king of Jerusalem and Amazing Grace; all movies that will be screened at TLVFest 2014 for free. In 1993 Amos Guttman died of AIDS.
