
A teenager has appeared in court in Dublin charged with the carjacking of a taxi near Terenure.

It is the third such crime to take place in Dublin in the past week alone and Gardaí are asking drivers to be extra vigilant.

At around 5am yesterday morning, the driver picked up a fare in Tallaght and was instructed to drive towards town.

A short time later, a meat cleaver type knife was held to his throat and the passenger ordered him to hand over all his money.

His iPhone, iPhone charger and his coin dispenser were taken before the driver managed to escape and raise the alarm at a nearby rank.

Gardaí said his attacker then drove the car through the city in a "dangerous and erratic" manner before crashing into another taxi in Cabra.

A 15-year-old boy was arrested a short time later and brought before the Children's Court this morning charged in connection with the attack.

Judge John O'Connor was told that the boy is in state care and he was granted bail on condition he stay within that secure facility and return to court in a week's time.

This is the most recent in a recent spate of carjackings across Dublin.

Last Friday, an armed robber jumped into a woman's car in Rathgar and Gardaí have today arrested a 41-year-old man in connection with that attack.

They are now urging motorists to take extra care by locking doors, keeping windows shut and making sure all valuables are out of sight.
