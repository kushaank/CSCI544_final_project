
The None of the Above (NOTA) option, introduced for the first time, garnered a countrywide vote share of 1.1 per cent in the Lok Sabha polls, said Election Watch member P.C Sai Babu.

The NOTA votes are more than the vote share managed by parties like the CPI and Janata Dal (United). Over 59.7 lakh voters across all 543 constituencies pressed the NOTA button. Uttar Pradesh led the NOTA tally in absolute terms, while Puducherry emerged at the top of the table in percentage, with 3 per cent of its electorate choosing to reject all the candidates, he added.
