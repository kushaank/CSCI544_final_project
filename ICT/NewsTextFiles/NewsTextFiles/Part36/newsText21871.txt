
'Let Our Children See a Lawyer!'

Outside of the Petah Tikva Magistrates Court on Monday, the parents of five youth arrested by the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) on suspicion of "price tag" vandalism protested the discussion on extending their children's detention.Â The protesters outside the court held signs reading: "let the children see a lawyer!" "we also have rights", "enough of the leftist dictatorship", and "enough of the witch hunt."
