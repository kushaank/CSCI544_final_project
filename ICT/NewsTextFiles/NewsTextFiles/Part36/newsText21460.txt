
CHANDIGARH: A  city businessman on Monday accused the police of tampering with his licensed weapons he had deposited with the department on account of Lok Sabha elections.  Rupinder Singh, a resident of Sector 27, said he had deposited sophisticated weapons, one gun and two revolvers in the armoury of police at Police Lines, Sector 26, on March 14.

"When I had submitted the weapons, these were packed in original boxes. When weapons were returned, boxes were changed. The original boxes were very costly," added Singh.

Singh, who emailed his complaint to the police department, said he suspected his weapons were also "touched" and tampered with. "These weapons hold sentimental value for me and I want an inquiry against the cops who handled them," added Singh.
