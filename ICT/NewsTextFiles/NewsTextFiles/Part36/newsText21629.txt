
The American Chamber of Commerce Ireland has called for reform of Ireland's personal tax regime at the earliest opportunity, and warned that both the high marginal tax rate and the low entry point to that rate remain major barriers to attracting key talent.

Speaking at the Chamber's Spring Lunch, President Louise Phelan urged the Government to widen the tax bands to reduce the impact on pay-as-you-earn workers and stimulate economic activity in the domestic market. She pointed out that high personal income tax rates also increase costs for companies, as they are forced to try to compensate for the burden imposed. In turn, they can struggle to attract and retain skilled employees.

Phelan welcomed Finance Minister Michael Noonan's recent hints that there may be room for tax cuts in his forthcoming Budget. She recommended that he consider the feasibility of "gainsharing" measures that would allow companies to reward employees in a tax efficient manner for achieving productivity rates over and above agreed target. "The tax system should be used as an incentive," she said.

At 52 percent, Ireland has one of the highest marginal tax rates among Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. The OECD average is just 36 percent.
