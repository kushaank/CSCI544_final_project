
The Head of Iran Space Agency (ISA) announced that the country is ready to launch three domestically-built satellites this year.

He said that the 'SharifSat', which is capable of capturing high-resolution color images, was to be sent into orbit two years ago, but the launch was delayed to further modernize, optimize and add more functions to the system. The 50-kg imaging satellite's resolution is capable of reaching five meters.

As for the 'Tadbir' satellite, Fazeli said that it is being developed in cooperation with the Iran University of Science and Technology.

Iranian students and academics from the Sharif University of Technology prepared the ˈSharif Satˈ for lift-off, while 'Fajr' was designed and constructed by the Defense Ministry.

'Tadbir' is an upgraded version of the 'Navid-e Elm-o Sanat' (Harbinger of Science and Industry) satellite, which was put into orbit earlier.

The satellite has Global Positioning System (GPS) as well as greater precision in taking photos compared to the one preceding it.

The country launched its first indigenous satellite, Omid (Hope), in 2009, and also sent its first bio-capsule containing living creatures into space in February 2010, using the indigenous Kavoshgar-3 (Explorer-3) carrier.

Iran is one of the 24 founding members of the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, which was established in 1959.
