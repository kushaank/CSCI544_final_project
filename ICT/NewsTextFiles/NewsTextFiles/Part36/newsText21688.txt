
According to Iran's Young Journalists Club's report released on May 19, Iran's Culture Ministry's Deputy in Parliamentary Affairs Hossein Noushabadi has criticized Leila Hatami's act in the Cannes Festival as against the Iranian chastity.

The Iranian actress shook hands with and kissed the 83-year-old Cannes President Gilles Jacob on the red carpet.

"I hope that those who attend international arenas as Iranian women would be careful about the chastity and dignity of Iranians so that the image of the Iranian woman is not tainted before the world," said Hossein Noushabadi.

He added "If they respect Islamic norms and the national culture and beliefs of Iran, it would be a desirable thing for Iranian celebrities to go abroad, but if their presence lacks regard for social values and ethical criteria, the Iranian nation is not going to accept it."
