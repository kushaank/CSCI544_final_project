
Srinagar :Â  One Army jawan has been killed while three others injured in an encounter with militants in Jammu and Kashmir's Budgam district.

The encounter started after security forces laid a cordon around a residential house where three militants are believed to be holed up.

The encounter comes a day after an Army jawan was killed and two others injured in the first major incident of firing by Pakistani troops at the border.

The Army said a patrol party was targeted by landmines and firing by a group of unidentified armed personnel or militants who were trying to cross over. The incident took place at 10 am on Sunday, when a team of the Maratha Light Infantry went to rescue a soldier, Vinod Kumar, who was injured in a landmine blast at the Pallanwalla sector near the Line of Control.

The landmine was allegedly planted by militants who ran towards a Pakistani post when Indian troops fired at them.

Pakistani troops allegedly opened fire and wounded three soldiers. One of them, Sepoy Bhikale Uttam Balu, later died.
