
Three Congress legislators not in favour of fresh polls in Delhi want the party to support the AAP in forming the government in the city, a party source said.

Earlier, the Congress emphatically said no to support the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party when a section of AAP legislators wanted the party to take power again with help from the Congress.

"I will express my opinion when the party leadership will seek. I don't want polls in Delhi now. We should do something," a Congress legislator told IANS.

A party source told IANS that many legislators do not want fresh polls to the Delhi assembly as they fear it would be difficult to retain their seats after the party lost all seven Lok Sabha seats to tghe BJP in the recent polls.

Delhi has been under President's rule since Feb 14 when AAP Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal resigned over his failure to pass the Jan Lokpal bill in the assembly.

In a house of 70, the AAP has 27 legislators and the Congress eight. The Bharatiya Janata Party has 31 legislators but three of them have now become Lok Sabha members.
