
The Kerala Government will extend all possible support for further expansion of the She Taxi service, owned and operated by women entrepreneurs for women travellers, to more cities in the state, Chief Minister Oommen Chandy today said.

"The initiative was a big success in Thiruvananthapuram. The government allotted special parking lots for She Taxis in the state capital," he said officially launching the service here.

He applauded the Department of Social Justice for taking up this venture which, he said, "has become a women empowerment model for countries across the globe to emulate."

"The She Taxi has grabbed global attention after its successful introduction in Thiruvanathapuram. Even authorities in the UAE are actively looking at the possibility of similar cab services for women," said Panchayats and Social Justice Minister Dr M K Muneer, who presided over the function.

"Initially, Kochi will have a fleet of ten cabs. Soon we will have She Taxis in Kozhikode. We are planning to roll out 250 She Taxi cabs in all major cities across the state," Dr Muneer said.

"I am extremely happy to know that the She Taxi, which started with just five cabs in Thiruvananthapuram, has become a huge success among women. I am proud to be the goodwill ambassador of this unique project," said popular actress Manju Warrier.

Later, the Chief Minister along with Manju Warrier and other dignitaries flagged off the first service.

The project, conceived and implemented by The Gender Park under the aegis of the Department of Social Justice, is being extended to Kochi after its success in Thiruvanathapuram where it was launched in November last year.
