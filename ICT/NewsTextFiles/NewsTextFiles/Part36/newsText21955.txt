Baltimore marketing and e-commerce firm Groove is acquiring another local advertising firm, Oomph Marketing.

Under the deal, Oomph's two full-time employees, including CEO Ray Bularz , will relocate from Federal Hill to Groove's new Little Italy headquarters. The acquisition will expand Grooveâ€™s offerings and help grow the companyâ€™s client base.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

â€œI think Groove is on a great growth trajectory and I think we will continue down that path,â€� Groove CEO Ethan Giffin said in an interview. â€œWeâ€™re excited to offer our clients a deeper dive into branding and strategy and multimedia production."

Oomph, founded in 2009, focuses on brand development and strategy along with print and television marketing campaigns. The company currently has about a dozen clients, including Smiths Group , MedStar Health and MECU.

In addition to the company's two full-time employees, Oomph worked on a project basis with four contractors â€” a creative director, a designer and two contract writers. The contractors will not work with Groove.

Oomph CEO Ray Bularz will lead Grooveâ€™s brand development as director of brand strategy. Bularz said the acquisition is a positive move for Oomph.

Bularz said the company has been profitable since it launched in 2009 but declined to disclose revenue.

Giffin thinks Oomphâ€™s specialties will complement Grooveâ€™s expertise in e-commerce and Web design. He expects to see his staff of 40 grow to around 50 by the end of the year, in response to an anticipated growth in clients as the company expands its offerings.

Groove moved into its new headquarters in October 2013 in the Fallsway Spring & Equipment Co. building in Little Italy. Giffin is a Maryland finalist for EYâ€™s 2014 Entrepreneur of the Year.
