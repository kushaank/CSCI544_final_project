
TEHRAN (FNA)- French Foreign Ministry Director General for North Africa and the Middle East Jean-François Girault expressed the hope that Iran and the world powers can strike a final comprehensive deal to settle their dispute over Tehran's nuclear program.

"My country supports the trend of the negotiations between Iran and the Group 5+1 (the US, Russia, China, Britain and France plus Germany) and hopes that the talks will yield results and lead to a final agreement," Girault said in a meeting with Iranian Foreign Ministry Director-General for Western Europe Abolqassem Delfi in Tehran on Monday.

"The French officials pursue the trend of the expansion of relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran and believe this approach is effective in consolidating the ties and promoting the mutual understanding," he added.

Girault underlined that Paris is willing to continue political talks with Iran on bilateral relations and regional developments, and said, "Possible obstacles shouldn’t prevent us from continuing the path of the expansion of ties."

“We have only one objective in the negotiations and that is reaching a solid, long-standing and durable agreement," he said.

His remarks came after representatives of Iran and the G5+1 ended a fresh round of talks on compiling a final deal in Vienna on Friday without reaching any tangible results for which the US excessive demands were blamed. In November, the seven countries signed an interim nuclear deal which came into force in January.
