
Chances of improvement for a badly injured sea turtle has soared after an Israeli team designed a new prosthetic fin and modeled on the wings of a US fighter jet. In 2009, the green sea turtle, named Hofesh, was caught in fishing net off Israel's Mediterranean coast. Rescuers had to amputate him after his two flippers were badly injured. All he was left with was a pair of stumps that made it extremely difficult for it to swim.

The turtle was initially fitted with a diver's fin. However, Yaniv Levy, director of Israel's Sea Turtle Rescue Centre, said that it only provided a little relief and Hofesh bumped into things as he tried to swim.

Shlomi Gez, an industrial design student at Jerusalem's Hadassah College, deiced to help the animal after reading about his poor condition on the net. He designed a prosthetic inspired from a fish's dorsal fin. The condition of the turtle improved to some extent because of the contraption, but Hofesh still, found it difficult to breathe and rise to the surface.

Then, Gez came up with a design inspired from Lockheed Martin's F-22 Raptor warplane. The new prosthetic has two fins and it somewhat resembles the aircraft's wings. It was fitted on to Hofesh's back on Thursday. It allowed him to move easily around his tank.

Gez explained, "I discovered it worked better than one fin on the back. With two fins, he keeps relatively balanced, even above the water".

Levy said that it will never be possible for Hofesh to return to the wild. However, he is placed in tank with a blind female turtle. It is believed that the turtle named Tsurit will mate and give a rise to the local population of the endangered green sea turtles.
