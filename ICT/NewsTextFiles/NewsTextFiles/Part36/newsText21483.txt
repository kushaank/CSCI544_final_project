
VADODARA: The anti-corruption bureau (ACB) nabbed a class one  government officer on Sunday while allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs one lakh. Kantilal Parmar, 58, was arrested by the ACB sleuths near  Sun City in Manjalpur area. The trap was laid by ACB sleuths on the basis of a complaint registered by  Ashok Patel who had applied for loan subsidy. Patel told the ACB that Parmar had sought a bribe of Rs 1.10 lakh from him some days ago.

According to ACB officials, Patel had applied for loan subsidy under the National Agriculture Development Plan run by state government for buying agricultural machinery. The first cheque of Rs 11 lakh towards the loan had arrived and was in the custody of Parmar, who is  district agriculture officer. The accused demanded Rs 1.10 lakh from Patel for releasing the cheque.

Patel, a resident of Dabhoi, gave Rs 10,000 some days ago but when Parmar demanded Rs one lakh the former decided to approach ACB. Patel approached ACB on May 14 and later registered a complaint on May 17.

The ACB then decided to lay a trap with the help of Patel. The complainant contacted Parmar and agreed to pay up Rs one lakh. Patel met Parmar by roadside and gave him Rs one lakh. The ACB caught Parmar red-handed and recovered the money. ACB sleuths also did video and audio recording of the incident. The accused was earlier posted in Junagadh and was transferred to Vadodara in September 2011. Parmar was to retire in next 12 days.
