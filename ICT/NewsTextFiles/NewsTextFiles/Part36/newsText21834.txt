Israel and China on Monday agreed to expand cooperation between their two countries, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcoming Chinese Vice Premier Liu Yandong to his Jerusalem office where they signed an accord.

In a statement, Netanyahu said Monday’s agreement came a year after his visit to China , where he met Chinese President Xi and Premier Li, listing the many ways cooperation has expanded since then.

“Especially during the Second World War, we fought shoulder to shoulder against the world’s fascism and we stood together through the dark time,” Liu said.

“In the past 20 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, our two countries have enjoyed sound political relations and ever stronger practical cooperation, and the past two visits all agreed that we should expand our cooperation in fields including innovation to the mutual benefit of the two countries,” Liu said.

As an aside, Vice Premier Liu told an anecdote from 1942 about her father, one of modern China’s founding generals, and a Jewish doctor who saved thousands of lives in Shanghai.

As Israel, the EUs loyal trading partners moves further and further Eastwards, taking its technical expertise towards Asia, China and now in a big way, India the silence about settlement building from the Sharia compliant EU is defining.

20 years ago, most Israelis myself included would have given anything to join the EU, but now this will no longer on the cards. A non judgmental Asia is truly open for business.
