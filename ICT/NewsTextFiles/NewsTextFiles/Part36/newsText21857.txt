
(JTA) — Dozens of Israelis serving in the Israel Defense Forces military reserves protested settler violence outside the Israeli West Bank settlement of Yitzhar.

Located deep in the northern West Bank, Yitzhar was the site of a settler attack against an IDF patrol last month. On May 4, Yitzhar Rabbi Yitzchak Ginsburgh blamed the IDF and the Israeli government for provoking the attack.

In recent weeks, a spate of “Price Tag” attacks, intended to exact a price for Israeli government policies seen as detrimental to the settlement enterprise, have occurred in Israel and the West Bank.

In the wake of violence emanating from Yitzhar, the Israel Police decided Sunday to establish a permanent base there.
