
New Delhi : Home Secretary Anil Gosawmi Monday met prime minister-to-be Narendra Modi at Gujarat Bhavan here.

In keeping with the secrecy of meetings between Modi and various Bharatiya Janata Party leaders, Goswami declined to throw light on the points of discussion.

Sources said he briefed Modi about the "priority issues" of the home ministry.

There were also talks about extending Special Protection Group (SPG) cover to the Gujarat chief minister.

K.S. Dhatwalia, information officer of the home ministry, said agencies were likely to ensure Modi is covered by the SPG at the earliest.

"The agencies, whether SPG or local police, are making arrangements for the prime minister designate's security. I cannot, however, tell you when and how these securities will be extended to him," Dhatwalia told IANS.

A source from the SPG told IANS that Modi will be given SPG commandos Tuesday soon after he is officially announced leader of the BJP's parliamentary party, which is scheduled to meet Tuesday for the purpose.
