
CHENNAI: The Chennai District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (South) has directed a private courier to pay a compensation of `10,000 for deficiency in service.

The Forum, represented by its president P Jayabalan and members L Deenadayalan and K Amala, also directed DHL Express (I) Limited in Egmore to pay the value of the articles sent and refund the amount collected towards fees, totalling `30,500, to the complainant.

According to a complaint from Mala of Puzhal, she sent pappad, biscuits, karasev, ready-made chapatis and potato chips, together worth about `6,000, on October 6, 2012 to her daughter doing MBBS in China. The courier collected `24,500 as charges for airlifting the items to China and assured Mala that the articles would be delivered to the addressee within seven days.

 However, the items were delivered after more than a month, on November 16, 2012. The courier also collected another `5,000 from the complainant’s daughter at the  time of effecting the delivery.

Due to the delay, the items sent had become unfit for human consumption.

Mala moved the Consumer Forum demanding a compensation of `2 lakh. DHL Courier did not respond to the notices issued by the Forum.

Passing an ex-parte order, the Forum held that the delivery of the items so long after the assured date amounted to deficiency in service. It directed the courier company to pay the complainant a total amount of `40,500 with 10 per cent interest from the date of booking of the parcel in October 2012.
