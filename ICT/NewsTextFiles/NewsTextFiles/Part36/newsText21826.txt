
IDF chief expresses concern for ability of army to remain prepared amid changing threats in the face of defense cuts.

IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Benny Gantz announced Monday that all  training exercises for reserve soldiers would be canceled until the end of  2014.

The announcement came amid an ongoing budget dispute between the  defense establishment and the Finance Ministry.

“The reserves will cease  training for a year, in order to give top priority in training to regular  service,” Gantz said at a ceremony for outstanding reservists at the Gelilot  army base north of Tel Aviv.

Gantz said that the IDF has had to adjust to  the numerous changes in the region and to the various threats facing Israel in  recent years. Those adjustments involve changes to reserve duty, including a  smaller reserve structure.

“National priorities are changing, and with  this, unfortunately, decisions dealing with defense are also changing.

As  a result of this, we are dealing with a complex resource challenge that we  haven’t seen before, and it could have dramatic implications for the IDF,” Gantz  said.

Gantz said that the IDF was being forced to make “painful  decisions” in all fields, including reserves.

He said that given the cuts  to defense, he was concerned with the IDF’s ability to meet its present  challenges and “very worried” about its direction going forward.
