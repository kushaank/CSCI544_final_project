The staff of Kurdistan complains from delays in the         receipt of salaries since the beginning of this year         after Baghdad cut the region's share of the budget         because of disagreements on the export of oil.

Kurds say that Baghdad is applying the economic         blockade policy and obscure their money to pressure         them to abandon plans towww.Ekurd.net export oil from Kurdistan         Region directly to the world market via a new         independent pipeline extending to the Turkish port         of Ceyhan.

For the past months people in Kurdistan region         protest against the delay in salary payments.

Since December 2013, Bagdad has suspended salary         payments towards to Kurdistan due to the ongoing         disagreement between Bagdad and Hewlêr [Erbil] on the issue of oil         exportation. Baghdad has only sent salaries for         January and February, while KRG has provided         salaries to its employees only for March.
