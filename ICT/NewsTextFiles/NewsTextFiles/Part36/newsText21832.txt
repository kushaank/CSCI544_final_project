
Retrial rejected for not citing enough evidence for 'reasonable doubt,' court rules.

Katzav's legal team filed the appeal in October , with Attorney Yehoshua Resnick, a former deputy state prosecutor calling the sentencing a "miscarriage of justice."

"An examination of the applicant's arguments shows that there is no fear of a miscarriage of justice," Handel declared, noting that the retrial has been rejected due to lack of new evidence.

Katzav was convicted in 2011 for the rape and sexual assault of female employees both during his tenure as Minister of Tourism and as Israel's president. He has currently served two and a half years of a seven year sentence; Katzav has always maintained his innocence in the case.
