
Patna :Â Nitish Kumar today told his Janata Dal United that his decision to quit as Bihar's Chief Minister after the party's poll debacle was not an ordinary one; it took a lot of courage.

"Nitish Kumar may not remain Chief Minister but the party will work under his direction," said party leader Vashisht Narayan Singh.

Mr Kumar, 63, resigned on Saturday taking moral responsibility for the party's drubbing in the national election.

The JD (U) won only two of Bihar's 40 seats in the polls that have seen a massive mandate for its former ally, the BJP, with which it parted ways last year when it decided to project Narendra Modi.

The JD (U)'s refusal to let Mr Kumar take a back seat may set him at odds with party chief Sharad Yadav, who is seen as his rival within.

Sources say Nitish Kumar has told party legislators not to "heckle" Mr Yadav.
