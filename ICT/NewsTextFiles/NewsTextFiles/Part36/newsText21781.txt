
MANILA, Philippines - Four Air Force pilots have been selected to fly the lead-in fighter trainer jets to be acquired from South Korea, a military official said Monday.

Col. Miguel Okol of the Air Defense Wing said years in service and flight experience were among the considerations in choosing the pilots who will handle the jets.

“We picked those with high jet time (compared) to the other pilots and years in service,” Okol said in an interview.

“Presumably, there will be four of them, (with the ranks of) major and captain, who are high timers in terms of jet time and qualification,” he added.

Okol declined to identify the pilots, citing security reasons.

The airmen, two of them instructor or test pilots and another two operational pilots, will undergo training in South Korea.

“The operative term there is train the trainors,” Okol said.

“They will soon become the instructor pilots,” he added.

The Philippine government and South Korea’s Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd. (KAI) signed in March the contract for the acquisition of 12 lead-in fighter trainer jets worth 18.9-billion.

The project, the biggest item in the military’s upgrade program, seeks to boost the military’s territorial defense capabilities.

The deal includes training for Filipino pilots who will maneuver the air assets.

The delivery of the jets will begin 18 months after the opening of the letter of credit, a document that assures KAI that the Philippines will honor its obligations.

The delivery of the jets is expected to be completed by 2017.

The deal is a product of about half a year-long negotiations between the Philippine security officials and KAI.
