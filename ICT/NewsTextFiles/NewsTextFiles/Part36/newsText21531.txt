
The Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting ended in New Delhi on Monday in an anticlimax, as Congress president Sonia Gandhi averted a planned attack on her son, party vice president Rahul Gandhi, and his team over the poll debacle. Both Sonia Gandhi and Rahul offered to relinquish their positions, which created emotional scenes so much so that no discussion could take place, not even choosing the leaders of opposition in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.

All party general secretaries also offered to resign, saying they were all equally accountable for the Congress’ poor show. They told Sonia she was free to revamp the party as she deemed fit. Manmohan Singh, currently caretaker prime minister, also joined others in persuading Sonia and Rahul not to resign, arguing that it was the collective defeat of the party. He pointed out it would be dangerous if leaders resigned at this juncture as “a weak opposition is even more dangerous since we have to play a constructive opposition role”. Singh took responsibility for price rise and not responding to the perception of corruption.

Senior leader Ajit Jogi said the resignations would only further demoralise party workers, who needed a morale boost to dispel the shock of the defeat.

The CWC authorised the Congress president to take whatever steps were necessary in order to revamp the party organisation at all levels.

“It is obvious that there were shortcomings. It is also clear that we failed to read the profound changes that had taken place in the country during the 10 years since the UPA was voted to form the government – changes that were, in large measure, due to the policies, programmes and legislation that had ushered in an era of rapid growth, empowerment of the people, and high expectations. And all, we should introspect, as to why we were unable to connect with the electorate,” said the resolution.
