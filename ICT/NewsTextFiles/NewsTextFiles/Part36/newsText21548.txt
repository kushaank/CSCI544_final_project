
Corridors of power are abuzz with a rumour that the Rajasthan government has decided to conduct an annual appraisal of its MLAs as it is done in a corporate setup.

In her previous tenure, Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, along with her team, prepared an annual report card for state legislators to monitor development in the state.

After coming back into power last year, sources in the BJP said that an appraisal exercise, like the one the chief minister conducted in her last tenure, would be revived in the state.

BJP functionaries said that Raje believed that such an exercise would tend to the interests of the MLAs, ministers and other post holders, as well as bring to light their achievements and efficiency.
