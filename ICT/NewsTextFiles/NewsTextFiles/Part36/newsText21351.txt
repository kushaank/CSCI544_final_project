
NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen told a news conference in Brussels on 19 May that Russia's "aggression" against Ukraine has posed a challenge to a fundamental idea -- "the right of sovereign states to choose their own path." NATO has condemned Russia's annexation of the Ukrainian region of Crimea.

He said the alliance has "unfortunately" not seen "any evidence at all" that the Russians have started a withdrawal of troops from the Ukrainian border.

Around 6,000 troops from Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, France, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the United Kingdom and the United States are participating in the exercise which will run until 23 May. The exercise is based on a fictitious scenario and involves participating Allied forces repelling an attack on Estonia. The participants were already in Estonia as of 5 May, taking part in the annual Estonian-led “Kevadtorm14” exercise which has now merged into the NATO-led event. Participating units include infantry and reconnaissance forces, engineers, fighter jets as well as anti-aircraft teams and a cyber security team.

The North Atlantic Council on 16 April 2014 agreed on a package of extra military measures to reinforce the Alliance’s collective defence in wake of the crisis in Ukraine. These measures include enhanced exercises, updated defence plans and appropriate deployments.
