
Baltimore-based marketing firm Groove said Monday that it's acquired a local company as part of a larger growth strategy.

Groove, which handles web design and e-commerce as well as marketing, did not disclose the terms of its purchase of Oomph Marketing, also based in Baltimore. The deal will broaden Groove services in areas such as brand strategy and multimedia work while giving Oomph clients more access to digital services.

"We thought it would be a natural fit," said Groove CEO Ethan Giffin.

Groove, which had 40 people on staff before the purchase, picked up Oomph's two full-time employees. That includes Ray Bularz, who founded Oomph in 2009 and joined Groove as director of brand strategy.

Groove, founded in 2007, said it's on track to grow to 50 people by the end of the year. It hired nearly a dozen "creatives and technologists" since moving from the Emerging Technology Center incubator in Canton to Little Italy in September.

The acquisition is Groove's first. Giffin expects to do more deals.

"We want to continue to grow through our organic growth, but we're also looking for other opportunities in the marketplace to acquire agencies," he said.

Groove was No. 2,276 on last year's Inc. 5000 list of the country's fastest-growing private companies. Its revenue jumped from about $863,000 in 2009 to $2.3 million in 2012.
