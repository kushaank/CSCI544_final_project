
Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh has asked his partymen not to be dejected by the poll outcome but make fresh attempts to regain the people’s confidence.

Mr. Singh, who reviewed the party candidates’ performance at a meeting here on Monday, told them to go back to the people and assure them that they would stand by the “janata” in their times of crisis.

Mr. Singh’s apparent move to keep his flock together rather than wield the stick on non-performers and those who worked against the party’s interest in the polls comes against a backdrop of the Bharatiya Janata Party seeking the resignation of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.

The BJP has already made it known that its next objective is “Mission 2017”, when Assembly polls will be held in Uttar Pradesh. The party has maintained that Mr. Yadav had lost the moral right to remain as the Chief Minister as the mandate was against the SP government.

According to party spokesman and Prisons Minister Rajendra Chaudhary, the SP chief directed the candidates and the party leaders to immediately go to the people and express their gratitude for their support.

Sources said some changes were likely to be made in the organisational set-up.

Monday’s meeting with the party candidates was essentially an interactive session to get a feedback on the poll outcome.

The candidates are said to have complained about the dubious role played by local leaders, and even Ministers and MLAs, to ensure their defeat.

A former MP, who lost by a slender margin in a constituency in western Uttar Pradesh, accused a Minister of plotting his downfall, the sources added.
