
The BJP in West Bengal today claimed that more than 200 party workers in the state had been injured in post-poll violence and asked the TMC government to maintain law and order, or else it would seek Governor's intervention.

West Bengal BJP general secretary Samik Bhattacharya said that more than 200 BJP workers had been injured in attacks wherever the party performed well in the Lok Sabha poll, either in an Assembly segment or a municipal area.

"BJP workers are being singled out for attacks. This is mockery of democracy. This kind of terror and attack unleashed on BJP workers by goons of Trinamool Congress across the state is unacceptable and will not be tolerated," Bhattacharya said.

He and other leaders in the party's state unit asked the Trinamool Congress regime to maintain law and order and said else, they would request the Governor to intervene.

"The government should take steps to book the culprits. Law and order is a state subject. If the state can't maintain law and order, the Centre will intervene through the Governor. Total goondaism is going on. This has to stop and can't be tolerated," BJP spokesperson and in-charge of Bengal Siddharth Nath Singh told PTI.
