
Security camera footage obtained by Defense for Children International Palestine (DCI-Palestine) shows two Palestinian teens being shot and killed during clashes near Ofer military prison in the West Bank city of Beitunia on Thursday 15 May.

The CCTV footage was captured by cameras mounted on the building where the incident took place, which is owned by Fakher Zayed.

"The images captured on video show unlawful killings where neither child presented a direct and immediate threat to life at the time of their shooting," said Rifat Kassis, executive director of DCI-Palestine. "These acts by Israeli soldiers may amount to war crimes, and the Israeli authorities must conduct serious, impartial, and thorough investigations to hold the perpetrators accountable."

Nadeem Siam Nawara, 17, sustained a fatal gunshot wound to the chest. Mohammad Mahmoud Odeh, 16, sustained a fatal gunshot wound to the back.

The boys were participating in a demonstration near Ofer military prison to mark Nakba Day and express solidarity with hunger striking prisoners currently held in administrative detention by Israel. The demonstration reportedly began peacefully and then turned violent when Israeli forces clashed with Palestinian youth.
