
BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) â€” The North Dakota University System is hosting a summit on "creating an atmosphere of respect."

Interim Chancellor Larry Skogen says the summit was spurred after some young people wore T-shirts with a caricature of the University of North Dakota's former Indian head logo drinking out of a beer bong.

Skogen says university system officials, tribal leaders, students and others have been invited to the meeting on Monday at the state Capitol in Bismarck.

Skogen calls the T-shirts appalling and says they reflected poorly on the entire university system.
