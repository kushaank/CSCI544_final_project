
Emily White, Marcus Crossland's wife and Dino's mother, said her husband has lost his job as a result of the incident and the family plans to move.

"Things like that are definitely not acceptable in our household, and we do not do anything like that,'' she told Geist. "Not that (not being there) excuses anything by any means, but nothing like that has ever happened before. There isn't anything behind closed doors or any kind of actions that have been taken anything like that, so it's definitely easy to take it out of context for sure.

Parenting expert and TODAY contributor Michele Borba said that while Marcus Crossland made a "horrifically wrong decision," every mom or dad can made a bad choice at one point or another.

"There is no perfect parent and every one of us will admit that we have had a bad moment. To what extreme – that’s going to vary parent to parent," Borba told TODAY Moms.

"But realize there are no take backs. So even in the moment, you always have to realize you’re the adult, you need to be recognizing your responsibility is for that child."

Borba was particularly concerned that Crossland walked away after the incident instead of checking on the boy. She also noted that the tactic of "if your kid is afraid of the pool, you throw him in the deep end" doesn’t work because it almost always increases the child's anxiety, stress and fear factor. Instead, baby steps can help a child conquer his fear, she added.

"The other thing you always weigh is the safety factor," Borba said. "Clearly, the child could have been hurt if not severely injured... (the dad) flunked every one of the criteria on what you do to do it right – safety, wise decision making."
