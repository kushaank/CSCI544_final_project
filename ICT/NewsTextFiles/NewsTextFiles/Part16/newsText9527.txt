
Former Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) on Monday said President Obama should replace Eric Shinseki as secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Kerrey, who served in the Vietnam War as a U.S. Navy SEAL officer, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism in combat. After his service, he was a patient of the VA for eight or nine years, he said.

Kerrey served in Congress from 1989 until 2001.

Shinseki also served in Vietnam, and has headed the VA since Obama tapped him in 2009.
