
DESPITE the whereabouts of missing Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 still unknown, a film about the "untold story" is ALREADY in the works – and a trailer has even been released.

The Vanishing Act promises to reveal what happened to the flight after it mysteriously vanished in March this year – although the trailer doesn't seem to give much away.

Looking like it was filmed by a bunch of film students at college, we see a Malaysian Airlines flight (on the ground) more than once, while passengers rest easy as their flight begins.

But dramatic music and a timestamp of the events leading up to its disappearance show that this was to be no ordinary journey.

Passengers start to look tense and we see brief shots of a GUN and people kissing.

We're not sure how director Rupesh Paul, who is pitching the movie at the Cannes Film Festival, knows so much about what went on, but he claims to have been told a new theory by a Malaysian journalist – who wishes to remain anonymous.

Knocking up the screenplay in 20 days, Rupesh hopes to have the film released by as early as August.

He told Variety: "People ask me one thing. If you’re saying a theory and suddenly the flight is found and it’s totally the opposite, your investment will be wasted.

"We will be fools. That’s the biggest challenge I’m facing."

He added: "Everyone in the world, they want to know what happened.

"Personally if you ask me, I want the truth to come out."

In case you were wondering, Rupesh confirmed that aliens WON'T be revealed as the explanation for the plane's disappearance.
