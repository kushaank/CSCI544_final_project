
ARIZONA STRIP — A Santa Clara teen is dead after a rollover accident on the Arizona Strip Saturday night.

At approximately 11:45 p.m. Mohave County Sheriff’s deputies responded to a single vehicle accident on Bureau of Land Management Road 1069. When they arrived on scene they found a Jeep Wrangler had rolled off the roadway, according to a press release from the sheriff’s office.

The rear-seated passenger Brooks Johnson, 18, was ejected and pronounced dead at the scene. Officials say he was ejected from the vehicle.

The driver, Connor Livingston, 20, of Ivins and two other passengers Brayden Oaks, 18 of Washington City, and Jace William Graft, 20, of Ivins suffered injuries and were transported to Dixie Regional Medical Center in St. George by ground ambulance.

Alcohol does not appear to be factor, according to the sheriff’s office, but speed appears to have contributed to the crash.

An autopsy is pending on the victim.
