The U.S. Supreme Court has refused to block state court rulings requiring New Orleans to pay $17.5 million for its share of the fire department's retirement fund for 2010 through 2012.

The Landrieu administration stopped making full monthly payments to the fund in July 2010.

The city said it couldn't afford the payments, and argued that ambiguities in the law give the mayor discretion over the amount of the city contribution. The city also says poor investments by the Firefighters Pension Board have driven up the city's contribution amount.

The city had asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stay implementation of the state ruling pending an appeal. Deputy Mayor Andy Kopplin said Monday the city is reviewing its options. He says the judgment will be "devastating" to the city budget.
