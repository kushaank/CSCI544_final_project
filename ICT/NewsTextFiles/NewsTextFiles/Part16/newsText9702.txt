
PHOENIX (AP) -- The son of a U.S. Army soldier from Tucson who died from wounds suffered in Afghanistan says his father's role in the 2003 rescue of former prisoner of war Jessica Lynch was just one facet of what he achieved in his life.

Calvin Barreras said Sunday that Command Sgt. Maj. Martin R. Barreras was instrumental in orchestrating Lynch's rescue, but he was humble about his part in it. "It was something he took part in, and it wasn't anything he wanted recognition for," Calvin Barreras said.

The Department of Defense confirmed this week that Barreras died Tuesday in San Antonio Military Medical Center. Officials say the 49-year-old was injured earlier this month when his unit was attacked in Herat Province, Afghanistan.

Based on an email from an unidentified friend and fellow Ranger, Fox News on Friday reported that Barreras served in the Army battalion that conducted the rescue. According to the friend, Barreras handed Lynch to another soldier to take her to a waiting helicopter, Fox reported.

The U.S. Department of Defense has not commented on the matter.

Barreras was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 5th Infantry, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division in Fort Bliss, Texas. A funeral service will be held May 24 in Tucson.
