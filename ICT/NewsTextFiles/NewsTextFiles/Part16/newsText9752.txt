
Hundreds of people have attended the funeral of Cpl James Walters - the Cornish soldier killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan.

Cpl Walters was given full military honours in the service which took place at Crowan near Camborne.

Friends described him as a "beautiful bloke" who would be massively missed by anyone who knew him.

On Sunday, a special rugby match between two teams he had played for, was staged in his honour.
