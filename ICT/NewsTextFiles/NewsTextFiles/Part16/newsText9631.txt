
Canada's controversial policies of transferring Afghan detainees over to the danger of torture by other nations and Canada's alleged participation in the Central Intelligence Agency's extraordinary rendition program are now being formally examined by the Office of the Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.

The request, with more than 250 attached documentations, was submitted by decorated Vietnam veteran and human rights activist John McNamer of Kamloops, B.C., in November 2013.

A representative of the Office of the Prosecutor told McNamer in a May 19 email that they have assigned a file number to his request and will let him know when they have made a decision, including reasons for the decision.

Canada's legal and law enforcement authorities have been willfully blind on this for years, even though all Canadian officials and military personnel are fully obligated to obey all aspects of The Rome Statute, which strictly forbids torture and complicity in torture."
