The widow of a Cornish airman killed in Afghanistan describes him as her soul mate, her best friend and the "bestest daddy in the whole world."

Corporal James Walters from Leedstown near Hayle was one of five who died when their helicopter came down last month.

The 36 year old's funeral was held on Monday morning.

His commanding officer calls him: "a professional soldier, a devoted father and a loving husband."

He was known as Bungle to his friends.

Best mate Olly Prior said: "James was a big guy - but his heart was just as big.

"In all the years I've known him I've never heard him bad mouth anyone. He would stand up for his mates.

"He never had a bad word to say about anyone.

"Just a top bloke - that we're all going to miss very much."

Corporal Walters was among five people who died when the helicopter came down near Kandahar.

The victims included Captain Thomas Clarke, Warrant Officer Spencer Faulkner, also from the Army Air Corps.

They were all based at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, along with Flight Lieutenant Rakesh Chauhan from the Royal Air Force, who also died.

Frank Webb has known James' family for 30 years: "I remember his dad coming in proudly one day saying he'd been accepted to go in the army. I think he was very proud because apparently his grandfather had been in the paras but it's a great loss; any of these boys that go away, I mean I take my hat off to them.

"I think he's devastated. I mean I know it's bad enough when you lose a parent. You don't expect your children passing away before you do; you expect them to bury you not the other way round."
