Inmates in Uzbekistanâ€™s largest penitentiaries have reportedly been deprived of family visits and parcels.

Relatives of several inmates in various penal colonies across the country told RFE/RL on May 19 that they have been refused access to their incarcerated relatives for almost a month.

Some of the inmates' relatives say they were told that a "temporary quarantine" had been introduced due to repair works in the penitentiaries' visiting rooms.

Officials at Uzbekistan's State Directorate to Monitor Penitentiaries refused to comment on the situation.

A representative of the Tashkent-based Ezgulik (Compassion) human rights group, Abdurakhmon Tashanov, told RFE/RL that the development is a violation of both Uzbek law and Tashkent's international commitments.
