
After worries that the winner of both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness would not be able to compete in the Belmont Stakes, the New York stewards have made an exception for California Chrome.

California Chrome has the chance of being the first Triple Crown winner since 1978 if he wins at Belmont, however due to the fact that he uses nasal strips there was a concern that the thoroughbred would be barred from participating.  While most states allow the usual of nasal strips, the New York Racing Association had banned them due to concern that they would give a horse an unfair advantage during a race.

Racing enthusiasts, recall when in 2012 a horse named I’ll Have Another also used a breathing during during it’s wins at both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness.  Like California Chrome, I’ll Have Another was barred by the New York stewards from using it’s breathing aid during the Belmont.  However the owners never challenged the ruling due to I’ll Have Another suffering from a leg injury.

The decision by the stewards means that any horse can now use nasal strips in any race in the state.
