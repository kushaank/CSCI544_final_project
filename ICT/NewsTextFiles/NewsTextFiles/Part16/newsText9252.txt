
A 73-year-old victim of an alleged road-raged fuel attack was thrown 20 feet after a Hawaiian surfer's car plowed into her, police said.

Jill Anjuli Hansen was charged with second-degree attempted murder after being arrested Wednesday. Hours after the vicious attack on Elizabeth Conklin, Hansen was being held on $1 million bail, New York Daily News reported.

As Conklin exited her car in the garage of her Waikiki apartment complex, the 30-year-old followed her through the condo's parking garage, Hawaii News Now reported.

After Conklin got out of her car, Hansen drove her Volkswagen Passat into her.

Hansen, who calls herself a professional surfer and model, would have run into her car again, if not for a building worker running over and smashing the back window of Hansen's car with a crowbar, causing her to flee.

"He saw her in her car getting ready to hit me again. He totally saved my life," said Conklin.

Authorities initially believed the attack stemmed from an earlier road rage run-in. According to UK MailOnline, Conklin said there was no such encounter, instead assuming Hansen was trying to steal her car.

"I parked in my normal parking place, and I got out and all of a sudden I woke up in an ambulance," Conklin told ABC News .

"She saw my car, it was the car she wanted, she followed me (and) was going to kill me to get the car," she said.

Police said Conklin and Hansen do not know each other, Honolulu's Star-Advertiser reported.

Before she was arrested, Hansen posted a picture of a BMW 328 wagon - believed to be the same car as Conklin's - along with a message about how she had turned professional as a surfer, according to UK MailOnline.

"I am becoming a professional! I have worked SOOOO hard to get to today. I am so grateful for all the support of the surfers and the ASP (association of surfing professionals)," Hansen posted on May 14, along with the picture of the car.
