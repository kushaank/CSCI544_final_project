EAST FLAT ROCK — An emergency call reporting a fatal stabbing outside a home off of Upward Road sparked the beginning of a long night for investigators Sunday as they worked to track down a suspect.

Officers said they considered their prime suspect, James Benjamin Charles, to be “armed and extremely dangerous” Monday morning as they searched the area around his home.

Investigators were summoned to Charles' neighborhood off of Jackson Loop Road at 6:57 p.m. Sunday, according to a news release from the Henderson County Sheriff's Office. Michael Rondell Brown, 36, of 201 North Clear Creek Road, Hendersonville, was found dead in the gravel driveway near Charles' trailer.

“Charles fled the scene in a silver 2002 Nissan Xterra,” said Chief Deputy Frank Stout.

Deputies spotted Charles' abandoned car on East Pace Street Monday morning, Stout said, and later discovered that he may have stolen a black 2000 Dodge Dakota pickup from Old Spartanburg Road.

Charles was stopped in the stolen truck near the intersection of Upward Road and Allen Road minutes before 1 p.m.

Charles, 46, of 35 Courtney Lee Lane, East Flat Rock, was charged with first-degree murder. Investigators were still working Monday to determine the motive of the stabbing or what, if any, kind of altercation may have preceded it and how the victim knew the suspect.

“We have worked this all night long... and we're still working on it,” Stout said Monday afternoon.

The State Bureau of Investigation is assisting in the case and the investigation is ongoing.
