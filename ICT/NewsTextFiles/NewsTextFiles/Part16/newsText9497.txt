
Journey with us to a future center of South Floridaâ€™s  economic growth: PortMiamiâ€™s new tunnel.

After three decades of planning, four years of construction and 420 days of drilling, the $1 billion PortMiami tunnel is barreling through its last days of testing before it opens for traffic.

The port held a grand opening ceremony Monday attended by Gov. Rick Scott, but it won't officially open for traffic for a few more days, officials said.

Leading from Watson Island to the port on Dodge Island, the tunnel will alleviate PortMiamiâ€™s cruise and cargo traffic with nonstop passageways and connections to the port from State Road A1A.

However, changes to PortMiami arenâ€™t anchoring down just yet. As previously reported, the port is continuing its dredging efforts to deepen the shipping channel by 2015. This will make it possible for the port to receive post-Panamax ships, the worldâ€™s largest cargo ships, and help boost the port's economic impact.
