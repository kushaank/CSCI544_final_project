David Ige says he’s been listening to Hawaii residents as he ramps up his campaign for the Democratic party nomination to run for governor.

People in West Hawaii have a lot to say about harbors, hunting and other Department of Land and Natural Resources issues, Ige said Friday, a week after his first visit to Hawaii Island as a candidate.

“They did express a lot of concern and frustration that harbor improvements weren’t made,” Ige said.

Harbor users also pointed out “some very basic amenities” harbors across the state are lacking, he said.

People also feel they aren’t being included in the decision-making process when new rules are being made regarding the harbors, he said.

“I do hear a lot of disenfranchisement,” Ige said.

In some respects, the concerns are similar to those he hears on other islands, including Oahu.

Prior to severing as the state Senate’s Ways and Means Committee chairman, Ige spent four years leading that chamber’s Health Committee. He oversaw the committee when it restructured the Hawaii Health Systems Corp. board system to create regional boards and when the Legislature approved the first step toward allowing public-private partnerships for HHSC facilities.

A measure taking those efforts even further failed to advance out of the Legislature this session.

He said he helped with several other big Hawaii Island projects, including providing the state’s portion of funding for the Hawaii Community College — Palamanui and the Kona Judiciary Complex.

Ige said he has learned quite a bit about Hawaii Island since beginning the campaign.

“I do make an emphasis on listening,” he added.

Ige is challenging incumbent Gov. Neil Abercrombie in the August primary election.
