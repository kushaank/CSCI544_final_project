
The upcoming presidential run-off election in Afghanistan needs to be as transparent as possible, according to a senior United Nations official in the country.

Speaking in the capital Kabul, Nicholas Haysom, the deputy head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan ( UNAMA ), said this second round of the election gives an opportunity for a much more "effective and complete" democratic exercise to choose a leader.

On 14 June, Afghan voters will return to the polls to decide between the two top candidates from the first round, Dr Abdullah Abdullah and Dr Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai.

On 5 April, none of those seeking the position achieved the 50 per cent plus one result needed to win.

Mr Haysom said the election raises a number of potential issues.

Mr Haysom added that the Afghan public and the United Nations have asked the candidates to assure that the campaigns would not be conducted in a manner which promotes the risk of ethnic tension and violence.
