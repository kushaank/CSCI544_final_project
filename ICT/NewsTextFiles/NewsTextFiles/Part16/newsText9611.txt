
The opposition alliance Unified Democratic Panel (MUD) delivered on Sunday to the international mediators in the government-opposition talks a dossier containing government spokespersons' statements and actions that allegedly contradict the Executive Office's willingness to dialogue. MUD representatives told mediators that dialogue would remain frozen unless the government brings about results.

The meeting was held at the headquarters of the Apostolic Nunciature in Caracas. The foreign ministers of Colombia, María Ángela Holguín; Brazil, Luis Figueiredo; and Ecuador, Ricardo Patiño, and Apostolic Nuncio Aldo Giordano met with the opposition alliance for some three hours and heard their allegations.

Among other things, MUD representatives complained about the statements of Mayor of Libertador Municipality Jorge Rodríguez, who on behalf of the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), said, referring to the possibility of a humanitarian measure for former police chief Iván Simonovis, "the release of political prisoners has not been discussed in these roundtables (...) that's Merrie Melodies."

Simonovis' is an emblematic case, as the government pledged, before international witnesses, to grant him a humanitarian measure, following medical evaluation to ascertain his critical health condition.

Dissenters also questioned crackdown on demonstrators and argued that after the government-opposition talks were launched, the number of people detained and prosecuted for taking part in demonstrations has climbed.

MUD executive secretary, Ramón Guillermo Aveledo, explained that now the international witnesses would talk to the government. "Let's wait and see what the government's response is, what their attitude is (...) the ball is in government's court."
