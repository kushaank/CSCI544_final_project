
During the hearing, Pervez Musharraf's counsel submitted a petition praying his client's exemption from appearance for Monday on medical ground, which the court granted. However, the court asked the guarantors of former President to ensure Pervez Musharraf's presence on the next hearing. Former Federal Interior Minister, Aftab Sherpao, former provincial Home Minister, Mir Shoaib Nausherwani and the two guarantors of Pervez Musharraf appeared before the court.

Sherpao and Nausherwani submitted their requests for their acquittal from the Bugti murder case.

On this the ATC issued notices to the relevant authorities and adjourned the hearing till June 16. This is the sixth time that the court has ordered for the former military dictator's appearance in court, but he has remained absent from all hearings despite assurance provided by his guarantors.

Baloch nationalist leader Akbar Khan Bugti was killed in a cave on Aug 26, 2006 during a crackdown ordered by Musharraf.
