
VLADIVOSTOK, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Golden Eagle luxury train arrived here Friday after a 15-day five-star trip across Russia.

Tourists from the United States, Britain and other European states were onboard for the journey from Moscow to this Russian Far East port.

As one of Russia's most comfortable trains, the trans-Siberian express is among the World's Top 10 Premier Trains, according to Forbes magazine.

Its spacious cabins provide everything its first-class passengers could want, from separate shower to LCD TV. The cost of the Trans-Siberian tour ranges from 11,500 to 20,500 euros.

Since 2007, this hotel-on-wheels has offered a long-distance rail journey across the Siberian region with stops in Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Ulan-Ude and other cities.

Each stop offers the travellers walking tours, cooking classes and hiking. The route also runs along the shore of Lake Baikal, the world's largest freshwater lake.

"The first-class voyage is very comfortable. We had a great trip enjoying Russian nature and culture. I visited Russia for the first time 15 years ago but only stayed in Moscow," an American tourist told Xinhua. "Now I've seen the whole country almost in detail. We will bring back very warm memories of Russia after this adventure."
