
SANTA ROSA, Calif. >> A Northern California woman is facing charges that she grabbed a  12-year-old boy by the throat while confronting him about bullying her  daughter, authorities said Sunday.

Delia Garcia-Bratcher, 30, of  Santa Rosa came to an elementary school around lunchtime Friday and  asked her son, who also attends the school, to point out her daughter's  alleged tormentor, the Sonoma County Sheriff's office said in a  statement.

The mother grabbed the boy by the throat in front of a number of children, the statement said.

No  adult saw the confrontation, and Garcia-Bratcher apparently had not  checked in with the school office before coming on campus, authorities  said.

The young witnesses later told a deputy the mother  threatened the boy about bullying her daughter. The staff at Olivet  Charter Elementary School took photos of red marks on the boy's neck as  soon as they learned about the alleged assault, authorities said.

Garcia-Bratcher was arrested on a charge of felony child abuse. She was released from jail after posting a $30,000 bail.

A  telephone number for a Delia Bratcher was disconnected. But on a  Facebook page that said it belonged to Bratcher, she posted that she was  hurt by the accusation and asserted that "the truth will be told."

Lt.  Mark Essick told the Santa Rosa Press-Democrat Â that deputies were looking into the bullying claims but have not  substantiated them.

not enough detail to comment - but sad for the last person (girl's mom).  usually the one to be caught and charged is the one trying to personally remedy an ongoing negative event which the proper authorities were not investigating until the last incident involving the mom.  bureaucracy at its best.

Spare the rod, spoil the child. Parents will do anything to protect their child.
