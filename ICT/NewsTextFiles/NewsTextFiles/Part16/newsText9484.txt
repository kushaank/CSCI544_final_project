
BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) â€” Tribal leaders want sanctions for any students who wore T-shirts with a caricature of the University of North Dakota's former Indian head logo drinking out of a beer bong.

The North Dakota University System hosted a meeting Monday at the state Capitol in Bismarck to address the issue.

UND President Robert Kelley told tribal leaders that federal privacy laws prohibit the school from identifying students or any sanctions against them. But he says "that does not mean nothing is being done."

The T-shirts that were stamped with the words "Siouxper Drunk" apparently were worn for an annual spring party that attracts students and others and is not associated with the university.

Interim Chancellor Larry Skogen called the T-shirts appalling and says they reflected poorly on the entire university system.
