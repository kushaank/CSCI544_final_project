
ASPEN, Colo. (AP) The Colorado state patrolman who was shot twice during a routine check on a vehicle in Glenwood Canyon on May 8 has been released from the hospital.

The Colorado State Patrol said Monday trooper Eugene Hofacker is continuing to recover.

Investigators say Thomas Ornelas was shot and killed by trooper Shane Gosnell at the scene.

Hofacker and Gosnell were driving together to a training session when they stopped to help a driver stopped in Glenwood Canyon. The driver fired at Hofacker, and Gosnell was able to fire back and kill Ornelas.

Garfield County Sheriff Lou Vallario says the Ornelas had an extensive history of violent crime and served time in prison.
