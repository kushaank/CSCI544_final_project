
In a sad turn of events, the award-winning director of Searching for Sugar Man, is dead. Malik Bendjelloul is reported to have committed suicide and was not murdered, as some reports initially indicated. It's unlikely if any autopsy results will be coming, as his brother has confirmed that the director suffered from depression.

In 2013, Searching for Sugar Man, actually took home an Oscar. Unfortunately, that success wasn't enough to keep Malik from tragically taking his own life.

"Searching for Sugar Man is a 2012 Swedish-British documentary film directed by Malik Bendjelloul, which details the efforts of two Cape Town fans in the late 1990s, Stephen 'Sugar' Segerman and Craig Bartholomew Strydom, to find out whether the rumored death of American musician Sixto Rodriguez was true, and, if not, to discover what had become of him."

"Johar Bendjelloul told the Aftonbladet newspaper in Sweden. 'I can confirm that it was suicide and that he had been depressed for a short period of time,' he said, adding: 'Life is not always so easy... I don't know how to handle it.'"

"I saw him two weeks ago in London. He was so full of life, hope and optimism and happiness, and looking forward to the future and future collaborations."
