
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) â€” Foreign mediators are in Caracas trying to get talks between Venezuela's government and the opposition back on track after they went off the rails a week ago.

The foreign ministers of Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador and a representative of the Vatican held separate closed-door meetings with the two sides on Sunday. A second round of consultations is scheduled for Monday.

The opposition last week froze month-old negotiations aimed at easing the country's political crisis to protest mass arrests at anti-government protests.

It is refusing to return to the negotiating table until the government makes progress on proposals ranging from an amnesty for jailed activists and a non-partisan truth commission to probe the circumstances that have led to at least 41 deaths since anti-government protests began in February.
