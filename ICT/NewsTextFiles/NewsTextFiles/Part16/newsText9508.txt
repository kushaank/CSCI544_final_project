
President Obama attended a dinner hosted by mega Democratic donors Jeff and Lora Drezner at their sprawling $5 million bungalow on five acres in Potomac, Md, on Monday evening, The Post's In the Loop column reports . The Drezners gave a combined $100,000 to candidates and political committees in the 2012 campaign cycle.

For the bargain price of $10,000 per person, or $32,400 per couple for VIP status, (that better be some spectacular filet) you could enjoy an “intimate dinner” with special guest Barack Obama, according to the invitation posted by the Sunlight Foundation.

This marked the fifth of Obama’s six fundraisers for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee before the end of the quarter, according to a DCCC aide.

The small party drew 65 guests. Can’t get more intimate than that.
