
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Heidi Heitkamp today called on the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to delay the final crop insurance planting deadline for corn growers in North Dakota. Additionally, Heitkamp requested that USDA consider moving back final planting dates for early spring crops in 2015 and subsequent crop years.

Many farmers will be unable to get their crop in the ground by the May 25th deadline because of a very wet spring. If the deadline is not extended, farmers will then have to decide whether to plant with limited or reduced crop insurance, or to participate in the prevented plant program.

Heitkamp, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, is also working with North Dakota farm groups to encourage them to provide producers with information about how the new prevented plant crop insurance rules may impact their operations. Last year, Senator Heitkamp pressed RMA to remove ambiguities in the rules regarding prevent plant coverage eligibility.

As a result of her efforts, USDA clarified the rules. However, eligibility has been restricted to farmers that have planted a crop at least once in the past three years. Given the wet planting seasons in 2011 and 2013, some farmers may be unable to access prevent plant policies this year. For this category of farmer, it is essential that they get a crop into the ground so that they can qualify for prevented plant policies in future years. Producers should contact their local FSA office immediately for more information.
