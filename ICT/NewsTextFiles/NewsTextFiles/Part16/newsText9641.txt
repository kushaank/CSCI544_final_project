
The father of Mele Salatielu, a young teen who suffers from severe rheumatic heart disease, is a grateful man.

A day after the plight of his daughter, 14, was featured in the Samoa Observer two weeks ago, the family received numerous phone calls and help from locals and Samoans living abroad.

In a previous article, father Salatielu Su’a had featured where he asked for financial help to pay for his daughter’s airfare to New Zealand so she can get her operation.

His daughter missed her first chance at getting the operation done last year because they didn’t have the money for her airfare.

He was worried if she misses out again this year it could mean death for Mele.

Yesterday, Mr. Su’a was worried no longer – at least not about the airfares.

He was thankful for all those who had given donations.

“I was overwhelmed with the love and support from people for my family, my daughter,” said Mr. Su’a who was in tears. “No words can describe how happy I am that my daughter will soon get treated.

Mr. Su’a said Mele and his wife are scheduled to leave for her operation on the 23rd May.

He said a local business had offered to pay for his wife and daughter’s airfare. Not only that, he acknowledged other businesses, families and people that called from overseas for their help and support.

The father also thanked the Samoa Observer for using the newspaper as a forum to help people like him.

Mele’s situation is so serious that heart specialist, Professor Dr. Satupaitea Viali said she “is facing certain death without an operation”.

“She is so young,” he said.
