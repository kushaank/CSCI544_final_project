The Marion County Grand Jury decided Monday that use of force by Salem police Officer David Baker was justified in the shooting death of  Michael Conley.

On April 30 officers from the Salem Police Department responded to a domestic dispute call from Conley's wife, Heidi, the Marion County District Attorney's Office said.

She reported that Conley was armed with a knife and not letting her leave their apartment in Salem, located in the 4700 block of Lancaster Drive Northeast .

When Baker arrived, he was confronted by Conley who was armed with a 12-inch military-style knife. Baker order Conley to put the knife down several times, but Conley refused, the District Attorney's Office said.

Conley told Baker he was going to stab Baker, and Baker backed away from Conley. Conley lunged at Baker with the knife, and Baker fired two shots at Conley, the office said.

Conley was taken to Salem Hospital and died at the hospital, the office said.

The Oregon State Medical Examiner's Office determined the cause of the death to be a gunshot wound to the head and the manner of death a suicide. Conley had a history of suicidal behavior, the District Attorney's Office said.

The investigation of the shooting was conducted by Oregon State Police and the Marion County District Attorney's Office.
