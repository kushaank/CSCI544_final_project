
“Joe Biden makes me laugh. He just cracks me up,” Maselli told The Hartford Courant .

The corsage was baby's breath, white roses, and red, white and blue ribbons. Biden's office said he was touched by the invitation and personally picked out the corsage so Maselli would feel special.

Biden said in the note that he was flattered but his schedule wouldn't let him attend. Biden's office also is arranging for Maselli to visit the White House to meet with Biden in July.
