
Space Exploration Technologies Corp.'s (SpaceX) Falcon 9 rocket stands in Cape Canaveral, Florida, U.S.

An unmanned SpaceX Dragon cargo capsule that lifted off from Cape Canaveral about a month ago made a return to Earth in California on Sunday, carrying with it more than 3,500 pounds of science samples for analysis.

The mission was the third of 12 of SpaceXâ€™s $1.6 billion contract with NASA for space station cargo runs. The company also is competing against Boeing and the privately owned Sierra Nevada Corp. for a related NASA project to take astronauts to and from the space station.
