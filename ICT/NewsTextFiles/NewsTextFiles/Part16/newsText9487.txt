Thomas Piketty has written a book called Capital that has caused quite a stir. He advocates progressive taxation and a global wealth tax as the only way to counter the trend towards the creation of a â€œpatrimonialâ€� form of capitalism marked by what he dubs â€œterrifyingâ€� inequalities of wealth and income. He also documents in excruciating and hard to rebut detail how social inequality of both wealth and income has evolved over the last two centuries, with particular emphasis on the role of wealth. He demolishes the widely-held view that free market capitalism spreads the wealth around and that it is the great bulwark for the defense of individual liberties and freedoms. Free-market capitalism, in the absence of any major redistributive interventions on the part of the state, Piketty shows, produces anti-democratic oligarchies. This demonstration has given sustenance to liberal outrage as it drives the Wall Street Journal apoplectic.

Here here. Only coercion, force and infiltration can maintain a total free market system from being overthrown by the masses.

I would only add that a truly functioning democracy leads ultimately to the implementation of socialist policies.

Runaway privatization can then be seen as a biproduct of corrupt politics and social and economic shock fabricated by certain leaders and business owners to force the population to accept these brutal free market policies.

Arvand khan as much as I really appreciate, respect and recognize your anti-Capitalist stands but, things are a bit more complicated than it seems.

A) As we discussed in another blog earlier today, violence, force and coercion are only one method of how ruling classes maintain their power, and the market system that constitutes the material base of their might.

Another more complex and effective method is how they project their hegemony throughout the society, and this is not only limited to the media but it is carried out on a daily basis by various social institutions from the schools to courts, to religious organizations (churches, mosques, temples,..) to the very family structure and our private lives. Due to such hegemony many people follow the ruling classes by consent, with no need for violence.

B) Socialism has historically been seen as an alternative to capitalism, but (and this is a very significant and huge point to keep in mind) after the failures of socialist experiments in USSR and PRC we need to be very specific and particular about exactly what do we mean by socialism, and how it is different from what happened in Russia and China. Simply put, how are we to ensure, guarantee and institutionalize self-organization of the working class and make sure that another bureaucracy doesn't take over and rule in the name of working class while actually exploiting them (which is what happened in USSR and PRC). An equitable distribution of wealth is a noble idea and practice, but that's just the beginning.

c) "The Shock Doctrine" is a great book by Naomi Klein. Unfortunately it remains on a journalistic level and lacks any theoretical depth. Below is an article by  Immanuel Wallerstein, pointing out why we are faced with a global, prolonged, long term structural crisis with no easy way out of it.

I agree. Lets look even deeper.

A. The use of propaganda is part of the way the right manipulates the discourse to suit their own agenda. The Republican party, for example, uses certain sentiments present in white American society to galvanize this huge voting block. Mainly racism, isolationism, and religion. This tactic was utilized especially starting in the 1960's and 70's when several billionaire investers began employing evangelist preachers to spread a combination of Christianity and capitalism throughout the white population. Issues like immigration were used to scare the population into supporting the Republican party which claimed to be the ''last stand'' as far as maintaining American traditional culture. I actually studied this phenomenon quite extensively several years ago. Not that I'm claiming to be some type of authority on the subject, but I do know my politics. Just saying.

B. Communism that was practiced in totalitarian regimes such as the Soviet Union is the exact opposite of what I was referring to. When I said a functioning democracy inevitably leads to socialist policies, I was referring to the Scandinavian countries, for example. Not all out communist takeover of the entire society. Big difference.

C. Naomi Klein is very controversial. Some people call her a radical feminist. I enjoyed her book though and took much of it with a grain of salt. For example, she had nothing to say about nonfunctioning democracies that emerge when politicians are bribed and coerced to support corrupt the monopolistic policies of the Chicago school method.

I'll read the article you mentioned. Thanks Z.
