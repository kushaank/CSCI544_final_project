PITTSFIELD — A western Illinois sheriff is facing a felony misconduct charge after prosecutors say he botched a 2012 death investigation of a woman who overdosed on heroin.

Pike County Sheriff Paul Petty, who is also the county's coroner, was charged after authorities said he didn't follow procedures for embalming the body of 47-year-old Shanda Lopez of Milton. The case stems from the fact that Petty didn't draw blood for a toxicology screening before Lopez's body was embalmed.

If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison and a $25,000 fine.

Petty said he remains the county's coroner and sheriff, a position he has held since 1998.

"I am going to go about my life," Petty told the Quincy Herald-Whig.

Petty's lawyer, Richard Frazier, said the case was handled appropriately.

"Neither the family nor anyone else thought (the death) was suspicious," Frazier said. "It was only after several days, if not weeks, that Sheriff Petty had questions about the circumstances surrounding the death."

Two other men were charged in connection with Lopez's death: John Edgar, who has pleaded not guilty to drug-induced homicide and is set to stand trial next month; and Chad Woolridge, who has pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and agreed to testify against Edgar.
