
A Chicago man was held on $750,000 bail Sunday after prosecutors say he fatally slashed the throat of a rival gang member outside a Little Village restaurant last April.

Jose Marroquin, 34, said little when he appeared before Cook County Judge Donald Panarese on one count of first-degree murder at the George Leighton Criminal Courts building.

Assistant State’s Attorney Claire Savaglio said Marroquin was inside Las Delicias restaurant, 4142 W. 26th, during the early April 27, when he exchanged gang signals with a group of rival gang members outside.

After the exchange, Marroquin ran outside the restaurant with a knife and stabbed Benito Juarez, 40, of Cicero, once in the throat, Savaglio said.

Juarez was helped across the street by his friends, where he collapsed, Savaglio said. He died at Mount Sinai Hospital less than an hour later, according to the Cook County medical examiner’s office.

The alleged attack was captured on the restaurant’s surveillance camera, prosecutors said. Marroquin, of the 2700 block of South Kildare, was later identified in a lineup by Juarez’s friends.

Marroquin turned himself in to Chicago Police May 16 after a warrant was issued for his arrest, according to court records.
