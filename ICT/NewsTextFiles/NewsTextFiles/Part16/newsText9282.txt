
NEW YORK — A woman who says she was jailed after falsely confessing to a crime and a man imprisoned for 20 years for shooting a hole in a wall are just some of the cases explored in a new documentary series that Al Jazeera America hopes will draw viewers to the fledgling news network.

"The System with Joe Berlinger," premiering on Al Jazeera America on Sunday, will explore the complexities of the US criminal justice system in an eight-part series that uses real cases to question the effectiveness of laws.

In the premiere episode of "The System," Berlinger explores why people might falsely confess to a crime that can lead to their conviction, even when DNA evidence might be scarce.

But it is the second episode that Berlinger says defines what "The System" is about: The case of Florida man Orville Lee Wollard who was jailed for 20 years after firing a gun into the wall of his home to scare off his daughter's violent boyfriend.
