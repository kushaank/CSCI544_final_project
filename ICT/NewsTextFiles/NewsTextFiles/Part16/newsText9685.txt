
Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee president N. Raghuveera Reddy has urged Governor E.S.L. Narasimhan to take immediate steps to convene the State-Level Bankersâ€™ Committee meeting to discuss the issue of farm loans to the agriculture sector.

At a press conference here on Monday, Mr. Reddy said that as the farm operation is fast approaching, it was time the Governor took the initiative and held the meeting to extend loans to the farming community.

He said after the Telugu Desam Party had promised to waive the farm loans, the repayment had come to a grinding halt.

He said unless the banks get loan repayments, they would not renew or give fresh crop loans.

Stating that farmers may be put to hardships, he wanted the Governor to take steps to provide relief to the farmers at the earliest.

Former PCC chief Botcha Satyanarayana took objections at the move of the private medical colleges to hold their own entrance test for admission into the MBBS course in the two States.

Speaking to reporters here, he said out of 6,000 medical seats in the State, 3,800 are in private colleges and there was scope for fleecing the students.

The students belonging weaker sections would be hit hard by such a move, he said, adding that when Eamcet was followed it was beneficial to the students.

A delegation of APCC leaders is expected to call on the Governor shortly with a plea not to allow private managements to conduct own entrance test.
