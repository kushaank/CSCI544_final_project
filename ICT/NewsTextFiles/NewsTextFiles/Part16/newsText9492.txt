
NEW ORLEANS - Former Saints special teams star Steve Gleason, who has been waging a public battle with ALS, underwent a tracheotomy Monday night.

Gleason said that he has shared his ALS journey publicly and saw no reason to not continue to do so, tweeting that he was getting procedure done Monday. Gleason ended the tweet with 'Tweet U later."

Gleason added a second tweet to his fans. "I believe in the power of intention, prayer, meditation, etc. I appreciate your unified focus on healing #NoWhiteFlags."

A Team Gleason spokeswoman said the surgery was "successful," and Steve "did really well."

Gleason's very public battle has been well documented. He has undertaken some novel approaches to life, including recording his voice so that he could type in responses and things he wanted to say and they would play back in his voice tone.

Gleason is remembered most by Saints fans for blocking an Atlanta Falcons punt that was returned for a score in the team's first game back in the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in 2006, the year after Katrina.
