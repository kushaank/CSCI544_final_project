
A New York man has filed a two undecillion dollar lawsuit demanding what is believed to be the largest amount of compensation ever after he was bitten by a dog.

Anton Purisima is suing a long list of defendants including the City of New York, a chain of cafes and a discount store for $2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.

Purisima filed his scribbled hand-written lawsuit in a Manhattan federal court on April 11 and is representing himself.

In his 22-page lawsuit, he details he is suing for injuries such as an infected middle finger he received after being bitten by a “rabies-infected” dog on a bus.

Bizarrely he then writes within his often incoherent lawsuit he is frequently overcharged for coffee at New York’s LaGuardia Airport.

Purisima alleges his also suffered civil rights violations, discrimination on national origin, conspiracy to defraud, retaliation, fraud, attempted murder, harassment and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The list of defendants in the case includes New York City Transit Authority, City of New York, cafe chain Au Bon Pain, Carepoint Health, a New Jersey University Medical Centre, discount store Kmart, a hospital’s emergency department, NYC MTA, LaGuardia Airport Administration, cafe chain Au Bon Pain and discount store Kmart.
