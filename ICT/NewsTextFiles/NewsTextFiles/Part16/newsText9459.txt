
Six years ago when a computerised passenger reservation system at the Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus (CMBT) was opened by the Southern Railway, commuters especially senior citizens felt the new facility would ease their travel.

But that did not happen. Instead, commuters including those from areas close to CMBT such as Anna Nagar west, Mogappair, J.J Nagar, TVS Colony and Thirumangalam were unable to book tickets there as the lone facility was not only far away from these residential areas but crowded round the clock.

“It is ideal to have a dedicated railway booking counter at the state-owned commercial complex on the J.N. Main Road in Thirumangalam as the complex is not only near empty but also close to many residential areas in Anna Nagar,” said V. Venketaramani, a resident in J.J. Nagar.

At present, residents in Anna Nagar west, J.J. Nagar, Mogappair, Ambattur Industrial Estate, Padi, Thirumangalam, Retteri, Sekkadu, Ambattur Old Town and Annanur have to travel to the existing railway ticket booking centre near the Anna Nagar police station. As most of the residents in these areas especially Thirumangalam, Mogappair and J.J. Nagar are senior citizens including retired government officials, they find it difficult to travel all the way to the booking centre near the Anna Nagar police station, a distance of around six kilometres from these areas.

Further, as most of the stretches in Anna Nagar were converted into one-way for the on-going metro rail work, residents struggle to book tickets and rely on private travel agents. “Many senior citizens were not tech-savvy and find it convenient to book tickets in person,” said 65-year-old P. Sethuraman, a resident of Mogappair.

There is clearly a need for a booking facility in Thirumangalam.

“We understand there is a need for such a facility there but the infrastructure including building, even if it is for rental, should be provided by the state authorities,” said a railway official.
