
Ahmad Shekib Mostaghni, spokesman for the foreign affairs ministry of Afghanistan said the government is currently engaged in investigation of alleged recruitment of Afghan refugees to fight in Syria.

Mostaghni further added that no formal report or evidence has been presented to the government of Afghanistan to prove the recruitment of Afghans in Syria conflict.

He said the government of Afghanistan will condemn the act if it was proved that the Afghan refugees are recruited to fight in Syria since it will be against the refugees’ rights and convention.

According to reports, around two million Afghan refugees are currently based in Iran and recent reports suggest that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps has recruited thousands of Afghan refugees to fight against the rebel forces in Syria.

Afghan refugees are also granted Iranian residency, $500 a month, school registration for their children and charity card to help the Assad regime, an Afghan religious leader Ayatullah Mohaghegh Kabuli quoted by The Wall Street Journal said.

However, the office of Ayatullah Mohaghegh Kabuli rejected that the recruitment of Afghans by Iran was confirmed by him.

Kabul following a statement urged all parties involved in Syria conflict to prevent further skirmish between the Shi’ites and Sunnis in Syria.
