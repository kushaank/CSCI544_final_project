
A little piece of paradise... but just over two months late!  The best laid plans... to rent our home, depart for trip on Feb 28th - what could possibly go wrong?  Now, some 10 weeks later we are down on the beautiful south coast, some five hours south of Sydney, visiting our old family holiday spot and actually STARTING our trip.  We reminisce, we remember, and I guess I still cry from time to time.  But the feeling here is good - peaceful and loving.

Medical news is good for me - tumour in my bowel was benign, but they did take a big chunk of my colon out.  Still have more tests to do when we fly back to Sydney in October, but can rest easy for the time being.

. We left for one weekend to visit Forster and to see Jodi Palmer Arthurson in her first horse "penning" competition, which was very interesting.  Lovely to be able to say farewell to Jodi as she leaves for Rupert for her son's wedding.

During the delay Gary and Kimberley were able to leave on a four wheel drive trip to the Victorian High Country.  This trip was meant to happen in January, but got postponed.  And in the meantime Kim traded in her car for a little Suzuki Grand Vitara - and was able to not only go on four wheel drive trip, but to drive the track herself.

.  So very beautiful and very very relaxing, and even more special to enjoy our time with our old friends.

Gary has to go back to Sydney later in the week to finalise something with the job, and hopefully when he returns we will be able to be on our way!  I believe it will take us some time to adjust to this new life - particularly Gary.  But give us time... we will give it a red hot go!

Great to hear from you.  I just returned from a week on van island.  You'll be happy to hear I bought myself a Samsung galaxy tab 4.  Having fun on it.  I'll watch for more blogs from you.  Happy trails.  Cheers!
