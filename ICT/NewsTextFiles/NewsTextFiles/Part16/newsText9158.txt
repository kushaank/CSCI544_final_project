JONESBORO, AR (KAIT) – A Region 8 teen has been arrested for making what investigators call a "hit list" of students at his high school.

Marrocas Sanders, 17, of Gobler is charged with terroristic threatening.

Pemiscot County Sheriff Tommy Greenwell says the investigation began in late April when a school resource officer received information about a possible hit list involving students within the Delta C-7 School District.

During the course of the investigation, Greenwell said the officer also learned Sanders had made threats on his Facebook page.

The information was submitted to the Pemiscot County Prosecutor's Office which filed formal charges.

Sanders was arrested and arraigned on Thursday, May 15. The judge set his bond at $150,000. Sanders is scheduled to appear in court on June 16 for a preliminary hearing.

The sheriff said additional charges could be filed.
