
NEW ORLEANS — A federal appeals court has refused to reconsider its March ruling that businesses don’t have to prove they were directly harmed by BP’s 2010 Gulf Of Mexico oil spill to collect settlement payments.

BP had asked the full 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans to rehear the case. A three-judge panel, voting 2-1, had issued the ruling.

The court said Monday that five active judges voted for a rehearing. Eight voted against it.

The court’s action preserves a December ruling by U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier.

Barbier had ruled that BP agreed to pay claims without requiring strict proof that losses were directly caused by the oil spill, and that the company’s arguments didn’t allow it to get out of the settlement it agreed to.
