
A frisky drunk who tried to get personal with a cash machine and a picnic table cooled off behind bars Friday night.

Police in Murfreesboro, Tenn., say Lonnie Hutton, 49, strutted into the Boro Bar and Grill, cozied up to the ATM, pulled down his pants and underwear and then attempted to have sexual intercourse with the machine.

According to wate.com, responding officers found Hutton, still nude from the waist down, walking around the bar, thrusting his hips in the air.

They took Hutton outside and told him to sit at a wooden picnic table.

Hutton was charged with public intoxication and booked into the Rutherford County jail on $250 bond.

He is scheduled to appear in court July 1.
