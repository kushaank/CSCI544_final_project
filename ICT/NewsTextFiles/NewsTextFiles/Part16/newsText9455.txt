
Ricardo has won substantial work from carmakers around the world, but  such is the secrecy that surrounds the launch of new products that the  company is unable to talk about much of this.

It is known that Ricardo is making the engines for the next “supercar” being  produced by McLaren, which will compete with expensive marques such as  Porsche and provide Ricardo with £240 million of work from 2016.
