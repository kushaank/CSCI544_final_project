Shortly after the green flag waved in the nation's heartland, Kwasniewski settled into the top 10 and was content on logging laps and taking care of his up & up Chevy. During the first caution on lap 41, Kwasniewski came down pit road and received four tires, fuel and adjustments. After the restart, Kwasniewski again settled into the top 10 and continued to take care of his car during the long green-flag run. The field saw two more cautions, allowing Kwasniewski to visit pit road and settle into the sixth position for another long green-flag run. On lap 211, however, Kwasniewski told crew chief Scott Zipadelli that he thought he had a tire going down. Not taking any chances, Zipadelli called Kwasniewski down pit road. During his time on pit road, the caution flag flew, causing Kwasniewski to go a lap down and restart from the tail end of the longest line. Despite the setback, Kwasniewski continued to battle for the remaining portion of the race, picking off competitors one at a time, and ultimately brought the No. 42 up & up Chevy home in the 11th position.

"Today was a good day for our team. My guys at Turner Scott Motorsports built me a great race car for this weekend. I think we had a top-five car, but unfortunately we weren't able to get the finish to prove it due to our tire problem. The car was really dialed in all weekend and we were running consistent top-five lap times all afternoon. I can't thank Zippy and these guys enough for all their hard work. It was a great experience to get behind the wheel of the No. 42 car this weekend and represent Target's up & up brand."
