Whats up? Early this morning the winds were calm the fire was tiny, where were the helicopter buckets? We didn't anticipate this? This is a travesty. Why don't we have buckets ready for this before it becomes a major fire? In the business world you would be broke/gone and replaced if something like this happened. Disgusted.

the babbling blundering bloggers at Nv4 don't "get" details too good. Let's allow the guy to point out their dumb errors, and hope they don't 'graduate' to Dispatch or Court clerk.

Breckenridge, did you really create a second profile just to make it look like more than one person other than yourself really gave a flying F wether it was SW or NW Reno???  Man you must be lonely.

P.S. Caughlin Ranch is in SW Reno, below the Truckee River, for those of you at Ch. 4 who don't know!
