Albany County Sheriff’s Office Shawn Duncan, 35, of Knox, was booked on charges that included marijuana possession and weapons possession after his father’s horse was found killed on Sunday.

An upstate New York man was arrested on drug and weapons charges after his father’s horse was found dead with an arrow through its heart, police said.

Shawn Duncan, 35, was cuffed after police found a stun gun, several bows and arrows along with marijuana inside his Knox home — which was searched after his father’s horse, Belle, was killed on Sunday morning, WNYT-TV reported.

Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple said the 6-year-old horse was targeted and likely killed from a high-powered crossbow.

“It’s an extremely twisted individual who would do that,” Apple told the Albany Times Union.

Bob and Lorraine Duncan rescued the former thoroughbred after it suffered an injury. They were keeping Belle with two other horses on a 42-acre Westerlo property that they rent.
