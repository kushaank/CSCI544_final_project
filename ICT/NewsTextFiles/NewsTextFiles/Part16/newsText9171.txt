
HERTFORD, N.C. ( WTKR ) — Six brothers accused of sex abuse faced a North Carolina judge today.

Eric Jackson, 27, and his brothers – Jon, 25, Matthew, 23, Nathaniel, 21, Benjamin, 19, and Aaron, 18 –appeared in court Monday on charges that they abused their sister.

The parents were also charged, because deputies said they witnessed the abuse on multiple occasions but did not take action. The parents, John and Nita Jackson, are out on bond.

The sheriff told WTKR that one of the brothers first confided in a pastor who told him to go to police.

When deputies showed up to the family’s Hertford home, they say the parents didn’t cooperate. It wasn’t until the girl told her story to Child Protective Services in Colorado that investigators were able to wrap up the year-long case.

Today, all of the brothers appeared in court in Perquimans County to request attorneys.

Additional charges are possible for all the defendants including the parents, said district attorney Andrew Womble, reported the Virginia Pilot.

The family will return to court this summer.
