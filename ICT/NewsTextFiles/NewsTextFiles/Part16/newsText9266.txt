WORCESTER â€” A public hearing on fee increases for inspections, road tests and registration fees will be held from 6 to 8 p.m. Tuesday at the Central Massachusetts Regional Planning Commission, Union Station, second floor.

Under a plan proposed by the state Department of Transportation in March, non-commercial vehicle registration fees will increase from $50 to $60.  There will be no change to commercial registration fees.

The fee for annual motor vehicle inspections will increase to $35, up from $29.  The road test fee will increase to $35, up from $20.

The Department of Transportation approved the fee hikes in March.  In a statement today, Sara Lavoie,a DOT spokeswoman, said the hearings will help DOT understand the impact from the fee changes.

"The regulatory process for changing these fees includes a single hearing, but MassDOT made the decision to hold three additional sessions in order to collect feedback from as many residents as possible. Comments collected during these four sessions will be considered as the scheduled effective date approaches as well as used to inform future fee related decisions."

Hearings will also be held May 22 in Boston and May 27 in Springfield.

In a story last week, the T&G reported an incorrect time and date for the Worcester hearing.
