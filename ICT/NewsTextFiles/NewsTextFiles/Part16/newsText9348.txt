
San Francisco police have announced an arrest in the homicide of a woman in a parking lot near a South of Market area nightclub.

Michael Sione Green, 24, of San Mateo, was arrested Friday in Miami, Fla., police Officer Albie Esparza said in a statement. He was arrested with the assistance of the Miami Police Department and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

Green is suspected of being the shooter in a November 2013 incident near Jessie and Sixth streets.

In that incident, Sacramento resident Melquiesha Warren and a friend were shot after a minor traffic accident in the parking lot about 2:10 a.m. Warren was with a group of friends who had been hanging out at a nearby night club and as they were saying their goodbyes, the vehicle Warren was in with her friend, was involved in the accident.

A woman in the other vehicle got very angry and tried to open the driver's side door of the car. Warren, who was the passenger in that vehicle, got out and tried to calm the woman down, when Green reportedly appeared. Green is then alleged to have shot both Warren and the driver, Esparza said. Warren was killed in the shooting and the driver was wounded.

Green will be extradited to San Francisco and he will be booked on murder and attempted murder charges, Esparza said.
