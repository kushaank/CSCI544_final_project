
MONTPELIER  A group representing migrant workers at Vermont dairy farms says it hopes to raise awareness this summer about housing and working conditions.

The group Migrant Justice protested Friday at the farm of Ray Brands in Ferrisburgh, where workers said they had been required to share a leaky trailer where sewage sometimes backs up.

There was no answer when The Associated Press attempted to reach Brands by telephone.

Migrant Justice leaders say theyve been successful in getting driver-privilege cards for farm workers who are in the country illegally, and getting legislation passed on bias-free policing.

Now they say they want to turn their attention to working and living conditions.
