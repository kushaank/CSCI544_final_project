A car and tanker truck collided in North Platte's Bailey Yards on Sunday.

Then the car's driver, a man from Wyoming, was airlifted to a Kearney hospital.

Lincoln County Sheriffs are now investigating the head on collision at Bailey Yards.

Early Sunday morning two vehicles collided in the yards.

Kerry Hoffard, 58, from Pine Haven, Wyoming, was driving his car westbound on a narrow oil road when he collided with a diesel tanker truck driven by Jeffrey Howard, 54, of North Platte.

Howard was not injured in the accident.

Upon investigation Sheriffs Deputies discovered that Hoffard was not wearing his seatbelt and it appeared he had consumed alcohol.

Hoffard suffered head injuries and was transported to Good Samaritan Hospital in Kearney.

Since Hoffard is not a Union Pacific employee he will be cited with trespassing and further charges could be coming.
