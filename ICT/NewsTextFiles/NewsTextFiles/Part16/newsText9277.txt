A Buffalo pub where a New York National Guard airman was critically injured during an attack remains shut down by authorities as they investigate whether two off-duty police officers working at the bar were involved.

Buffalo Police Department spokesman Michael DeGeorge says Molly's Pub remains closed Monday, three days after it was ordered shut down by the city's police commissioner.

The bar's manager, 35-year-old Jeffrey Basil (BAY-sihl) of Williamsville, was charged over the weekend with assault in connection with the attack that left 28-year-old William Sager Jr. of Silver Creek near death. Basil has pleaded not guilty.

Police say Basil pushed the airman down a flight of stairs early on the morning of May 11. Sager suffered severe brain injuries and remains in critical condition.

Police are investigating the actions of the two off-duty cops.
