
PORT VILA, Vanuatu --- Reports from Vanuatu indicate moves are underway to organise a motion of no-confidence against the new Prime Minister Joe Natuman.

Natuman was elected by forty of the country's 52 MPs on Thursday after a successful motion of no-confidence to remove Moana Carcasses as Prime Minister.

The Vanuatu Daily Digest reports that Carcasses is organising a motion against Mr Natuman and has seventeen signatures in support of it.

Meanwhile, a minister in the new-look Vanuatu Council of Ministers says he's confident that the government can advance much-needed political reform.

The Lands Minister, Ralph Regenvanu says there appears to be a strong support base within government to move legislation designed at addressing the chronic political instability that has hampered Vanuatu's parliament for years.
