LAKELAND | Deputies arrested a 56-year-old Alabama man Saturday on charges he sent explicit text messages to an 11-year-old Lakeland girl, sheriff's officials said.

Kenneth Robert Crisp of 247 County Road 463 in Muscadine, Ala., is facing three counts of transmission of material harmful to a minor, according to the Polk County Sheriff's Office. He is being held in the Cleburne County Jail in Alabama until he can be extradited to Polk County, the Sheriff's Office said.

The girl's mother called the Sheriff's Office on Friday after finding sexually explicit text messages and voice mails on her daughter's cellphone, allegedly sent from Crisp, the Sheriff's Office said. The mother told deputies that Crisp is a friend of the family.

According to the Sheriff's Office, the girl said Crisp asked for her phone number in case he needed to get in touch with her family. She said they've been talking for several months, the Sheriff's Office said.

On the girl's cellphone, deputies found hundreds of text messages and picture/video messages sent from Crisp between April 27 and May 3, the Sheriff's Office said.

In the messages, he called the girl "hottie" and "sweetie," and he told her to delete them so her mother wouldn't find out, the Sheriff's Office said. He also said he wanted to have a baby and asked her to send naked or semi­naked photos of herself, according to the Sheriff's Office.

"We don't care where you live — if you prey upon our children here in Polk County, we will find you, and we will ensure that you are arrested," Polk Sheriff Grady Judd said in a news release.

Deputies said Crisp was aware the girl was only 11 years old.
