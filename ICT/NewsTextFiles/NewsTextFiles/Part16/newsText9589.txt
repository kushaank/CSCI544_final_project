
A woman was attacked by a bear on a military base in Alaska on Sunday, according to The Associated Press.

Various accounts of the incident are swirling, suggesting she was either knocked unconscious by the bear or played dead -- which is what you are supposed to do when encountering a bear, Webb added.

"It was very quick, and she didn't remember much," Webb said of the attack and what the woman could remember.

In 2010, the base increased bear awareness efforts after four girls, ages 5 to 9, had a bear encounter.

Terri Frana, 44, of Lake Mary, was in her garage when one of the five bears attacked her, causing her to receive 30 staples in her scalp and 10 stitches on her forehead.
