
Authorities said a man was arrested after he allegedly tattooed a smiley face along with a derogatory word on a 12-year-old girl’s arm in Centerville, Pennsylvania.

According to the Erie Times-News , state police announced Friday that Randall Charlton was taken into custody and charged with felony assault, endangering the welfare of a minor, corruption of minors, simple assault and tattooing a minor.

The Associated Press reported that Charlton was sent to Crawford County prison and his bail was set at $20,000.

Officials said the alleged incident occurred last Wednesday evening while the girl was spending the night at a friend’s house. There is no word yet on what the 33-year-old was doing there and why he allegedly inked a 12-year-old in the first place.

Under Pennsylvania law, it is illegal to tattoo anyone under the age of 18.

The permanent artwork on the girl’s left forearm consists of a yellow smiley face with an offensive word above it.

As of Monday, Charlton has not posted bail and remains in custody.
