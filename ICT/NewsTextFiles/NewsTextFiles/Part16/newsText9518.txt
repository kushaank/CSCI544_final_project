WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama will return to Chicago on Thursday to appear at two fundraisers for Sen. Dick Durbin and other Senate Democrats.

He’ll spend the night in his hometown and depart Friday, the White House said.

Durbin, D-Ill., the assistant majority leader in the Senate, is seeking a fourth term against Republican state Sen. Jim Oberweis in the Nov. 4 election.

Obama is to attend a 5 p.m. fundraising reception Thursday at the home of Michael and Tanya Polsky and a 6:30 p.m. dinner at the home of Fred Eychaner, according to an invitation to the events.

Eychaner, the founder of the Newsweb Corp., is a top fundraiser for Obama and other Democrats.

Michael Polsky is president and CEO of Invenergy LLC, based in Chicago. The firm develops, owns and operates power generation facilities in North America and Europe, its web site says.

The invitation was sent out by Durbin and Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., who chairs the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.

Five-figure givers also get a photo opportunity, the invitation says.

The proceeds will benefit Durbin's campaign treasury and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the invitation says, and due to timing restrictions, guests may attend either the reception or dinner, not both.

The first $2,600 of any person's contribution will go to Durbin's campaign fund and the next $32,400 will go to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the invitation says.
