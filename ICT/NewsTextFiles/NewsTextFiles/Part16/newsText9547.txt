
BALTIMORE--( BUSINESS WIRE )--At the American Telemedicine Association (“ATA”) 2014 annual conference,        InTouch Health® today announced the launch of the world’s first FDA        cleared App for iPad® that enables real-time auscultation from a digital        stethoscope. InTouch Health’s CS App for iPad connects over the Internet        to its purpose-built Remote Presence medical devices equipped with a        stethoscope. Unlike other iPad stethoscopes that only provide        store-and-forward capabilities, the CS App for iPad uses sophisticated        quality of service technology to transmit real-time live auscultation        from a patient to a remote doctor. With the CS App for iPad, InTouch        Health broadens its leading Acute Care Telemedicine solutions as        critical care doctors (known as “intensivists”) and advanced practice        clinicians can now auscultate during remote consults into an intensive        care unit (ICU) from any iPad.

Across the country, there is a growing crisis in hospital ICUs. On        average, patients admitted into the ICU suffer an estimated 1.7        potentially life-threatening errors each day. The Joint Commission reports that intensivist-managed ICU staffing is associated with a        significant reduction in ICU mortality, morbidity and length of stay.        However, according to The Journal of the American Medical Association,        the current intensivist shortage will become increasingly acute, with        the supply meeting only 22 percent of the demand for services by 2020.        The CS App for iPad allows hospitals to have greater access to        intensivists resulting in higher quality care for more ICU patients.
