
BJP leader Narendra Modi has said that in his conversation with U.S. President Barack Obama last Friday they discussed strengthening India-U.S. strategic partnership.

Unlike the heads of state of the United Kingdom, Sri Lanka, Australia, Canada, the Maldives and Singapore, no reply-tweet came from Mr. Obama’s or the White House’s account.

The communications between U.S. and the new Indian regime are being watched closely.
