
The Barnett and Abbott governments are refusing to release the cost-benefit analysis that has apparently underpinned the decision to commit $925 million of Commonwealth funds to the contentious $1.6 billion Perth Freight Link project.

Federal Assistant Infrastructure Minister Jamie Briggs  said the project would generate more than $5 of economic benefit for every $1 spent, a claim that appears to be based on unreleased Main Roads modelling.  WA Transport Minister Dean Nalder said  its release "may negatively impact discussions with the private sector".
