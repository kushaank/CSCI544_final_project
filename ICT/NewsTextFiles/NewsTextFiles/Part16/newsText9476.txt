
LITTLE ROCK — The University of Arkansas Board of Trustees is scheduled to consider a tuition increase for all campuses in the UA System in a two-day meeting this week.

Meeting at the University of Arkansas Community College at Hope on Wednesday and Thursday, the board will consider raising tuition and fees to fund priorities such as a minimum 2 percent merit raise for faculty and efforts to improve retention and graduation rates, the UA System said Monday in a news release.

Under the proposed plan, tuition for the 2014-15 academic year would increase by 5 percent from the current $7,818 to $8,209 at the flagship campus in Fayetteville; by 6 percent from $5,624 to $5,962 at the University of Arkansas at Fort Smith; by 4.7 percent from $7,601 to $7,959 at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock; by 5 percent from $5,793 to $6,082 at the University of Arkansas at Monticello; and by 3.5 percent from $5,753 to $5,956 at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff.

—Cossatot Community College of the University of Arkansas, by 5.4 percent from $2,212 to $2,332 for in-district students and by 5.4 percent from $2,512 to $2,647 for out-of-district students.

—Phillips Community College of the University of Arkansas, by 3.9 percent from $2,495 to $2,593 for in-district students and by 3.9 percent from $2,855 to $2,967 for out-of-district students.

—University of Arkansas Community College at Batesville, by 4.4 percent from $2,700 to $2,820 for in-district students and by 4.4 percent from $3,060 to $3,195 for out-of-district students.

—University of Arkansas Community College at Hope, by 4.7 percent from $2,271 to $2,378 for in-district students and by 5.7 percent from $2,421 to $2,558 for out-of-district students.

—University of Arkansas Community College at Morrilton, by 4.1 percent from $3,290 to $3,425 for in-district students and by 3.9 percent from $3,500 to $3,635 for out-of-district students.

“Our institutions have made an effort to keep tuition increases as modest as possible and to focus specifically on the most pressing needs for continuing to provide a high-quality educational experience to our students across the system,” said UA System President Donald Bobbitt.

Arkansas ranks last among the 16 states in the Southern Regional Education Board in average faculty salaries at both two- and four-year schools.

The four-year universities in the UA System are expecting to receive increases of less than 1 percent in state funding for the 2014-15 fiscal year, while state funding for the two-year colleges will remain flat.

The UA System said that while enrollment has increased at its four-year schools by more than 6,000 students since fiscal 2009, per-student state funding has fallen in that time from $6,904 to $6,020.
