
Work continues at the development Walnut Grove, where attention to detail is not being overlooked. As KPLC's Lee Peck reports it's combining the old with the new for a one of kind community in the Lake Area.

 A bicyclist was rushed to a Lake Charles hospital Monday night after colliding with a car on Highway 14 near Hillcrest Drive.

Two Lake Area men are in jail after stealing and damaging two ATVs, authorities said.

Calcasieu Parish Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Kim Myers said 24-year-old Cody Don Brock, of Lake Charles, and 27-year-old Jeret Matthew Wilson, of Moss Bluff, were arrested early Thursday morning.

"Deputies conducting extra patrol at a Moss Bluff convenience store observed two suspicious men covered in mud and water enter the store," Myers said Monday in a news release. "While speaking with Brock and Wilson, deputies received a call regarding an ATV in the ditch near the store."

Myers said a cordless drill and a bag of keys were located on the ATV.

"When deputies ran the VIN number of the ATV and contacted the owner, he advised the ATV was stolen from his home and a second ATV was damaged during the night," Myers said.

Brock and Wilson were charged with simple burglary, two counts of motor vehicle theft over $1,500 and two counts of simple criminal damage to property.

Brock's bond was set at $115,000 while Wilson's bond was set at $140,000.
