
A  US man has filed a  lawsuit over a  dog bite, demanding what is believed to be the largest amount of  compensation ever - $2,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. Anton Purisima, 62, filed the hand-scribbled lawsuit in Manhattan federal court seeking the huge amount and, in turn, likely setting a new record for a lawsuit money demand.

The Manhattan man has sued the city, NYC Transit, Au Bon Pain Store, two local hospitals, Kmart, a dog owner â€”for two undecillion dollars. Purisima, who is representing himself, correctly listed the obscure number few have heard of (2, followed by 36 zeros) - in a 22-page complaint that accuses the defendants of everything from civil rights violations to attempted murder.

The complaint states that the dog was "rabies-infected", and a "Chinese couple" took snaps of him being treated. He is suing the LaGuardia Airport for overcharging his coffee and Au Bon Pain, Hoboken University, the MTA, and thousands of others for various reasons.

The suit claims the pain and damages he suffered cannot be measured in money and are, therefore, "priceless". Included in the suit as evidence is a photo of his bloodied finger.
