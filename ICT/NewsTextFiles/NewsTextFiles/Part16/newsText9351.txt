Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown on threat to his state and the world: 'We have to adapt. The climate is changing.'

People need to find a way to 'live with nature' and 'not to collide with it'

Gov. Jerry Brown continued to sound the alarm about climate change on Monday, saying people need to find a way to "live with nature" and "not to collide with it."

"We have to adapt," he said. "The climate is changing. There's no doubt."

Brown's speech, at a Sacramento event organized by the Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics, touched on deforestation in Brazil and the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet.

"We can't do this overnight," he said.

Still, he has managed to disappoint some environmentalists who want the governor to ban fracking, a controversial method of oil extraction. Protesters gathered outside the building where Brown spoke Monday, waiving signs and changing, "Climate leaders don't frack!"
