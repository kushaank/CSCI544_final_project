
In tonight's What's Working, we shine the spotlight on Tommy Caine, owner Caine's Piggly Wiggly and B&H Food Store in Mobile. Caine owns three Piggly Wiggly stores in Baldwin County, one in Florida, and B&H Food Store in Mobile. He has been in the grocery store business for several decades, following in his father's footsteps.  Giving to charity is nothing new for him. He says, "I started when I opened the stores up. You give back and the community will give back to you."

Caine says giving back is what he has always done. He donates food and money to over forty charities in Mobile and Baldwin Counties. He also gives to local schools. He is a big supporter of the VFW. In fact, recently he treated the Army National Guard 226th Maneuver Equipment Brigade to a Welcome Home lunch after they returned from Afghanistan. Catholic Social Services tells News 5 they are very appreciative of all the donations Caine has made to their organization.

Caine encourages other businesses to give back as well. He says, "The small and large businesses, they can change the world by giving back."
