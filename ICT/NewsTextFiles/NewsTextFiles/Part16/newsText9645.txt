
African National Congress Women's League (ANCWL) president, Angie Motshekga has called on all South Africans to join in campaigning for the safe return of over 200 abducted Nigerian school girls.

Motshekga says they will embark on an intense campaign for the safe return of the girls, and has invited South Africans to sign a petition which will be available on the league's website. Â Petitions will also be distributed at schools, government departments and companies.

She was speaking at a media briefing in Pretoria on Monday morning. The girls were captured over a month ago by the group Boko Haram.

Motshekga says the Women's League has been in talks with various South African organisations, and is looking at sending a delegation soon in solidarity with the people of Nigeria. As from Monday night the league will also light 230 candles every night at the Nigerian embassy in Pretoria until the safe return of the girls.

The league has also called upon all people to join a mass prayer in their various churches, stadiums and other venues.
