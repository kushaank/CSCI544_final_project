Cornell William Brooks says he is a product of the gains of the civil rights movement and that he looks forward to leading the nation’s oldest civil rights organization.

Cornell William Brooks insists that he is a beneficiary of the very gains in the civil rights movement that he is now called to protect and expand.  Brooks was selected over the weekend as the new president and chief executive of the NAACP, succeeding Benjamin Todd Jealous, who resigned last September.

Brooks, who is 53 and serves as executive director of the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice, is also an ordained minister.

Since he will not formally assume the office for several weeks, until July, Brooks said he is not yet prepared to speak in specifics about his plans to lead the nation’s oldest civil rights organizations.

Still, Brooks maintained that he wants to see the organization continue its strong focus on voting rights.

Brooks was raised in Georgetown, South Carolina, and went to Jackson State University in Mississippi. He then went to Yale Law School, where he was the senior editor of the Yale Law Journal. He also has a master’s degree in divinity from Boston University.

Brooks served as senior counsel with the Federal Communications Commission and on the transition team for Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey in 2010. He is also a former trial attorney with the Lawyer’s Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.

He comes to the helm of the NAACP during a period of stability and growth. Under Jealous, who left to spend more time with his family, the organization experienced an increase in revenue, from $25 million in 2008 to $46 million last year. At the same time, the number of individual donors increased eight times in the same period.

Jealous, who is now working as a partner with Kapor Capital and as a senior fellow with the Center for American Progress, offered his congratulations to Brooks.

"This is the beginning of a new and exciting chapter for the NAACP," Jealous said, in a statement. "Cornell William Brooks has led an impressive career. I look forward to the Association continuing its mission under his leadership."

Brooks says he finds the prospect of leading the NAACP both thrilling and formidable.
