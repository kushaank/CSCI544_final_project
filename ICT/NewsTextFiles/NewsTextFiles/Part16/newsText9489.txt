
Retired St. Louis businessman and philanthropist Eric Newman sold two coins at an auction in New York late last week for $1.41 million each.

In total, four sales of coins from Newman's collection by Heritage Auctions of Dallas have brought in $44 million, the New York Times reports . Newman, who is 102, has dedicated the proceeds from the sales to promoting the study of coins, including support for the Newman Money Museum he established at Washington University, his alma mater.

In November, Newman sold a collection of nearly 2,000 rare American coins for $23 million during a two-day auction in New York City.

Newman previously told the Business Journal that his interest in coins dates back to when he was 7 years old and his grandfather gave him a one-cent piece dated 1859.
