
CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa  Cedar Rapids police are investigating another case of someone firing gunshots in the city.

This latest situation has set off angry responses from neighbors who say they’re sick of the violence.

Investigators said several shots were fired just before 6 p.m. at Fifth Avenue and 15th Street SE. Police said they do not have any reports of injuries, but the bullets damaged some property.

Last month, Cedar Rapids Police Chief Wayne Jerman said officers had investigated 28 incidents of shots fired, so far this year. It’s a number that is continuing to grow.

Monday night police said they were still trying to figure out what spurred the incident. They’re interviewing people who may have been related to what happened. As of 9:00 Monday night, police said they had not made any arrests and don’t have any suspects.

Neighbors crowded around as police officers filled the scene. Many said they heard it all happen.

We were just sitting inside the house, and all of the sudden I heard four or five shots and then just came out and a bunch of  group of people were in the middle of the street arguing, said Dawn O’Brien-Munis who lives a few houses from the scene.

Yellow tape surrounded a sidewalk corner at Fifth Avenue and 15th Street SE. Investigators placed yellow numbered markers by shell casings lying at the scene.

I was just upstairs playing with the kids and I heard about five or six gun shots go off, and I hurried up and pushed them to the floor and ran outside to see what was going on, said neighbor Cara Poorman.

Police also unrolled crime scene tape around two cars, damaged by the bullets.

O’Brien-Munis said the police have been frequent visitors lately.

Two, maybe three times a week, O’Brien-Munis said.

Neighbors are scared and frustrated. They say enough is enough.

I’ve lived here for about eight, nine years now, and I have two grandkids that live with me. So, I am kind of worried about their safety, said O’Brien-Munis said.

It’s crazy down here. I mean, that’s all that I can say, said neighbor Don Brown.

With bullets flying nearby, it’s all hitting too close to home.

If it would have just been on the opposite corner, the bullets would have probably hit our house and probably would have gotten my son, Poorman said.
