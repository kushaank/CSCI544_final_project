
The City of Pittsburgh and Local 1 of the Fraternal Association of Professional Paramedics reached a contract agreement.

The contact includes salary increases to medics authorized under Pittsburghâ€™s last Act 47 recovery plan. Medics will receive back wage increases they were allowed under the 2009 Act 47 plan of 2 percent in 2012 and 2013, and 2.5 percent this year. The increases will cost roughly $1.1 million and be paid to medics in two installments.

Negotiations with all unions begin again after approval of a new Act 47 recovery plan this summer.
