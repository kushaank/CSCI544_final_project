
A former upper East Tennessee city recorder has been indicted by on charges of stealing approximately $73,000 in city funds, authorities said.

Linda Darrell Douglas, 65, turned herself in to Tennessee Bureau of Investigation special agents at the Campbell County Jail on Monday afternoon, according to the TBI. She was released after posting a $10,000 bond.

Douglas resigned as Jellico’s city recorder in December 2012, after what city officials at the time attributed to an internal memo she wrote that was leaked to the media.

Her resignation, however, also coincided with the release of an audit by the Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasury, which triggered a TBI investigation.

TBI agents developed information that Douglas, who worked in Jellico city government for 10 years, allegedly took the money from the city police department’s drug fund, as well as other city funds.

On Friday, the grand jury indicted Douglas on one count of theft of more than $60,000 and three counts of official misconduct.

More details as they develop online and in Tuesday’s News Sentinel.
