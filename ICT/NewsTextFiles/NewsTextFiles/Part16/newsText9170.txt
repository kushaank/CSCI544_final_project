
A Butte man accused of vehicular homicide while under the influence is back behind bars.

The Butte-Silver Bow sheriff's department said bondmen attempted to take Lucas Virgil Hundley into custody when he slipped out of his jacket and fled.

After almost 5 hours of searching, police found him in a trailer two blocks away. Despite being tased, Hundley slipped away a second time.

They tracked him to crawlspace back at the original home and took him into custody.

Police allege Hundley had methamphetamine in his possession.

Prosecutors allege Hundley was on meth when he hit 77-year old John Hellander with his car last October.
