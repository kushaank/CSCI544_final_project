
Court records say a central Idaho man accused of killing a neighbor and hiding the body told officers he acted in self-defense.

Forty-nine-year-old Keith Eric Blankenship of Hailey was charged with second-degree murder and concealing evidence Thursday in the slaying of 47-year-old Steve Michael Romanchuk.

A Blaine County sheriff's report says Romanchuk's wife reported her husband missing in January. She said he had lent money to a neighbor and later confronted him over the loan.

The report says after initially denying knowing Romanchuk or receiving money from him, Blankenship told a deputy on Wednesday he killed a man in self-defense and buried him in his backyard.

The Times-News reports detectives taking video outside of Blankenship's home Thursday came upon a pile of dead leaves with partially exposed human remains.
