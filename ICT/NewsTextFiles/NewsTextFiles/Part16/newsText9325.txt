
If history is a guide, two out of 10 registered voters will show up at the polls today to cast a ballot.

And, if the scarcity of contested races is taken into account, that percentage could go even lower.

In contrast, the 20 percent who showed up to vote in the last gubernatorial primary in Pennsylvania was preceded by a 71 percent turnout for the presidential primary two years earlier.

Those numbers are indicative of the interest a presidential election attracts in both the primary and general elections, compared to elections for governor, state legislators, members of Congress and local boards.

The irony is that, with the exception of Obamacare, there are few national issues that get people as fired up as the local and state issues of school taxes, crime and the condition of roads and highways.

State and local issues have more to do with household income, education and jobs and the quality of life than national issues. And yet, voters are much more likely to stay at home when the decision-makers for those issues are on the ballot.

The election Tuesday features a Democratic primary for governor among four candidates, three of whom are from the Philadelphia region.  Robert M. McCord, of Bryn Mawr, and Allyson Y. Schwartz, of Abington, and Katie McGinty, of Tredyffrin Township, are battling Tom Wolf, of York County, for the Democratic nomination.

Gov. Tom Corbett is unopposed in the Republican primary in his re-election bid.

In the 13th Congressional District, Republicans Carson Dee Adcock and Bev Plosa-Bowser are battling for the nomination while Democrats Brendan F. Boyle, Val Arkoosh, Marjorie Margolies and Daylin Leach are vying for their party�s nomination.

In perhaps the most heated local race, two Democrats are challenging incumbent state Rep. Margo Davidson in the 164th District. Billy Smith and Dafan Zhang are both looking to wrest the nomination away from Davidson, who has drawn fire for her support for both school choice and restrictions on abortion clincs. Davidson has enthusiastically defended her record. The winner will take on Saud Siddiqui in November.

There are several other contested races across the region.

In the 8th Congressional District, Kevin Strouse and Shaughnessy Naughton are battling for the Democratic nomination.

In the 146th State House District there is a fight between Thomas J. Quigley and Harvey Friedland for the GOP nomination.

In Berks, Daniel Boone Area School Board member Andrew Basile is challenging incumbent David Maloney for the Republican nomination in the 130th State House District.

But throughout Pennsylvania, nearly half the state lawmakers whose terms end this year are unopposed.

Although all 203 state House seats and half of the 50 Senate seats expire, only seven Senate incumbents have primary opposition. In the House, 34 incumbents are in contested primaries, but nearly 100 others have no opposition in the primary or in November, according to the Associated Press.

One might think voters believe their state lawmakers are doing a great job, but public opinion paints a different picture. Pennsylvania residents, particularly in southeastern and south-central Pennsylvania, are clamoring for property tax reform and a more equitable system of school funding.

The cost of higher education, the condition of Pennsylvania roads and bridges, a failure of lawmakers to adopt ethics rules and a $40 billion pension liability are among the frustrations citizens share that rest with the state Legislature.

We can�t think of a better reason to vote than the need to change how business is conducted in Harrisburg.

Participating in that process certainly seems more worthwhile than staying home.
