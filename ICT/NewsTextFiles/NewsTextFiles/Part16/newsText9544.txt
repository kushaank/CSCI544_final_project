
High school student Talia Maselli’s top choice for prom date turned her down. But he invited her to visit him at the White House instead.

Vice President Joe Biden wrote a handwritten note to Maselli to tell the Connecticut high school student he would be unable to accept her request to join her at prom, according a story from the Hartford Courant published Monday, but the vice president included a corsage and an invitation to meet him at the White House.

Maselli wrote the vice president’s office last fall asking Biden to her prom, but said she never expected any kind of response.

She warned that if he turned her down, she might have to invite a second choice — Republican House Speaker John Boehner.

Last Thursday, the night before her prom, Maselli received a handwritten note from the vice president. The letter included a red, white and blue corsage that his office said he picked out personally.

Maselli, who said that receiving the letter was “crazy,” didn’t end up going to prom. But she certainly doesn’t intend on missing out on her trip to meet the vice president, which will likely be scheduled for July.
