
The government of Afghanistan slammed Islamabad over Pakistani national security advisor Sartaj Aziz’s remarks regarding the role of the Taliban group in Afghan government.

Sartaj Aziz has said that the Taliban group in Afghanistan should have a role in the new government of Afghanistan.

However, the foreign affairs ministry of Afghanistan reacted towards Aziz’s remarks and said no one has the right to interfere in internal affairs of Afghanistan.

Foreign affairs ministry spokesman, Ahmad Shekib Mostaghni said Monday the only the government of Afghanistan can decide regarding the internal affairs of the country.

Mostaghni further added that the foreigners do not have the right to comment regarding the internal affairs of Afghanistan and such remarks are baseless.

The remark by Sartaj Aziz comes as the government of Afghanistan is struggling to encourage Taliban group for peace talks.

Afghan president Hamid Karzai is keen to invite the Taliban group’s leadership based in Queta city of Pakistan for peace process; however the Taliban group has so far refused to sit in for peace talks with the government of Afghanistan despite Pakistan’s meddling to encourage the Taliban group for peace process.

well said bro, well said.
