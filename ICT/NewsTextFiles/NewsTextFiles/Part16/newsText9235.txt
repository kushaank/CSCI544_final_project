GRAND RAPIDS TOWNSHIP, MI – Criminal charges have been dropped against a man who allegedly brought a loaded handgun inside his carry-on bag at the Gerald R. Ford International Airport, but the Sparta resident still has to give up his gun and CCW license.

Jason Emanouil was traveling with his wife and two children Feb. 17 when Transportation Security Administration staff noticed a handgun on the X-ray monitor, according to police.

Airport police examined the bag and found a loaded Ruger .380 semi-automatic handgun, police say.

Police said 39-year-old Emanouil has a concealed weapons license and told investigators he carries a firearm because of the large amount of cash held at his business, Enterprise Iron and Metal in northwest Grand Rapids.

Emanouil allegedly knew the weapon could not be taken with him, but he forgot to take it out of the bag before going to the airport, according to court records.

However, it was determined after further investigation that Emanouil’s actions were likely not intentional, Kent County Prosecutor William Forsyth said.

“We’ve done in this in at least two other cases where we determined it was accidental,” Forsyth said.

In exchange for the charges being dropped, Emanouil had to surrender his weapon and his license to carry. He can re-apply for his license, however.

While he does not face prosecution by the state, he is still subject to potential fines from the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, which can run between $3,000 and $7,500, according to the TSA’s sanction guidance handbook.

Emanouil spent several hours in the Kent County Jail after the incident, until he posted bond.
