
Maine-Endwell's spending plan calls for a 2.15 percent tax levy increase, which is the maximum allowed under the cap. but for the first time in three years there would be no staff cuts.

In Binghamton the tax levy increase would be 2.95 percent and a loss of five positions due to attrition. However, Binghamton's spending plan also calls for the addition of two school resource officers, a social worker, and $400,000 to decrease class size in grades K-2.

"Certainly lowering class size in K-2 will enable teachers to do the kinds of work they need to do with children to establish strong reading and math fundamentals," said Dr. Marion Martinez, superintendent of the Binghamton City School District.

Binghamton's budget calls for a 6.13 percent spending increase. That number, though, falls to 2.15 percent once the district gets reimbursed by the state for the asbestos removal last year at Calvin Coolidge Elementary School.
