NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — Two people were killed, and two more were injured, in a crash Monday evening in Marine Park, Brooklyn.

The accident happened around 6:30 p.m. at Avenue U and Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn, police told CBS 2.

1010 WINS' Carol D'Auria reports.

A Nissan Maxima headed south on Flatbush Avenue struck a BMW turning onto Avenue U from northbound Flatbush Avenue, police said.

The Nissan spun around and hit a telephone pole, and appeared to be split in half.

The driver of the Maxima, a 20-year-old man – was taken to Coney Island Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, police said.

His passenger, an unidentified woman, was pronounced dead at the scene.

The driver and passenger of the second vehicle were taken to Kings County Hospital Center with minor injuries, police said.

As 1010 WINS’ Carol D’Auria reported, the deadly crash was caught by a security camera at the scene.

The man who installed the camera said he took one look at the horrifying video and said the Nissan Maxima looked like it was speeding.

“I would think that the best cause to prevent this is to put a speed camera, or something that would inform the drivers of how fast they’re going,” he said.

The investigation was ongoing Monday night.
