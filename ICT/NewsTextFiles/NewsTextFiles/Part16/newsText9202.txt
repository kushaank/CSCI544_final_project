Swear in downtown Brighton near the Imagination Station playground, and theres a good chance youll be getting a ticket.

Colin Andersen learned this lesson the hard way.

The 19-year-old Brighton resident was hanging out with his friends on a sunny April day in a parking lot next to the pavilion and Imagination Station; Andersen said he swore under his breath and no children heard him.

However, a Brighton Police Department officer heard him and issued him a ticket for disorderly conduct.

Brighton Police Chief Tom Wightman said its OK for teenagers to hang out downtown, and the city doesnt have a law prohibiting certain words.

Wightman said the playground is popular, especially with families and young children. Sometimes, police are called due to teenagers or young adults acting disorderly.

Thats what gets on our radar, their behavior, he said.

Andersen said this was the first ticket hes ever received; he said he doesnt even have a speeding ticket.

Andersen fought the ticket but lost when he went before a Livingston County District Court magistrate to present his side of what happened. He was fined $200.

Andersen said he doesnt think it was right to issue him a ticket without a warning. If he had been warned, he would have listened to the officer.

I would have respected his authority, he said.

At the hearing, Andersen said the police testified they had given him a warning, something he denies happened.

Andersen said children were not close by, and he wasnt loud when he said the profanity.

That would require an officer with some incredible hearing, Wightman said.

Andersen said he argued with the officer because he didnt understand why he and his friends were told to leave the downtown area.

We just like to hang out, he said, adding the downtown is convenient because its a central place.

He also figured expressing his opinion was allowed in this country.

However, he admitted his parents suggested a different approach.

Its a bad idea to argue with cops, he recalled them telling him.
