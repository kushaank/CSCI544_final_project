
INDIANA (AP) – Authorities in Western Pennsylvania have released the names of three people killed in an early morning fire in a trailer home over the weekend.

The Indiana County coroner’s office said 28-year-old Shawn Marsh, 27-year-old Nicole Novak and 9-year-old Gabbriella Novak were killed.

Neighbors reported an explosion before fire crews were called at about 3:30 a.m. Sunday to the blaze in White Township, about 65 miles east of Pittsburgh.

Firefighters reported finding the victims along with two dogs dead in a rear bedroom after getting the flames under control.

Novak’s stepfather, Rich Morrill of Butler, said two other young children were staying with relatives and weren’t home at the time of the fire.

Autopsies are scheduled on the victims. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.
