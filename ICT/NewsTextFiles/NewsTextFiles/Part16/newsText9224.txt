Jeffrey Frederick, 33, of Philadelphia, who authorities alleged maintained a residence in the Fishtown section of the city that was being used as a marijuana stash house, has asked a Montgomery County judge to prevent prosecutors from using at trial any evidence seized from the Memphis Street apartment and any evidence obtained from wiretaps.

Detectives alleged they seized about 50 pounds of marijuana from the apartment.

Prosecutors will have the chance to respond to the request when a judge holds a pretrial hearing on the matter.

Frederick and his brother, Dennis, 41, of Drexel Hill, are two of nine men arrested in May 2013 in connection with the alleged drug trafficking ring that authorities alleged distributed nearly two tons of high-grade marijuana, shipped from California to Pennsylvania, and generated nearly $15 million in profit.

Six others, who are still awaiting court action on various drug-related charges include: Charles Sadrin, 55, of Lincoln, Calif.; Ernest Peterkin, 24, of Philadelphia; Martin Williams, 32, of Philadelphia; Earl DeSantis, 45, and John Walker, 29, both of Secane, Delaware County; and John Martin Warnock, 23, of Herndon, Va.

The ninth person charged, Stanislav Dubovsky, 27, of Philadelphia, previously pleaded guilty to multiple felony counts of possession with intent to deliver marijuana and conspiracy in connection with his role as a distributor in the drug ring and is awaiting sentencing.

The ring was first discovered operating in Whitpain in 2012, authorities alleged, and the subsequent investigation involved confidential sources, phone wiretaps, law enforcement surveillance and four controlled marijuana buys in Montgomery County.

Based on shipping records obtained through a Montgomery County Investigating Grand Jury subpoena, the arrest affidavit alleged, county detectives calculated that approximately 3,673 pounds of marijuana was shipped by Sadrin from Sacramento, Calif., to Philadelphia, between Jan. 16, 2012, and April 22, 2013, where it was later delivered to Dennis Frederick, who sold the marijuana to customers earning a gross income of $14.6 million.

That quantity does not include approximately 271 pounds of marijuana delivered by Sadrin to Dennis Frederick and Peterkin on May 7, according to authorities.

The investigation was a cooperative effort between the Montgomery County District Attorney’s Narcotics Enforcement Team, Pennsylvania State Police, the Montgomery County District Attorney’s Drug Task Force, the Bucks County Detective Bureau, the Delaware County District Attorney’s Office, the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
