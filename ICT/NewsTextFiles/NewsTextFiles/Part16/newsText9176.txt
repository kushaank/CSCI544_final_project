A woman was jailed late Saturday after Oklahoma City police say she tried to light her boyfriend on fire.

Chana Reede, 27, was booked into the Oklahoma County jail on an arson complaint. Reede is accused of spraying lighter fluid on her boyfriend and chasing him with a lighter during a domestic dispute, police said.

About 8 p.m., police responded to a call from an apartment complex and found a man who smelled strongly of lighter fluid sitting inside a locked vehicle.

Reede remained in Oklahoma County jail custody Monday, a jail spokeswoman said.
