Howard Jaffe, 51, was arrested in Florida earlier this month and extradited to Marion County.

A Florida-based party planner who authorities said wrote a bad check to cover the cost of an event during Indianapolisâ€™ 2012 Super Bowl weekend has been arrested.

Howard Jaffe, 51, was arrested in Florida  this month and extradited to Marion County. He faces counts of check fraud related to the 2012 incident  and a 2008 incident, according to court documents.

In February 2012, Jaffe hired Evans Audio and Visual Co. to turn the former Borders bookstore at 11 S. Meridian St. into a lounge for private VIP parties during the Super Bowl, documents say.

The $50,000 check Jaffe wrote Evans was returned for insufficient funds, documents say.

In the months that followed, Jaffe told police and Evans Audio and Visual owners that he would make the check good to rectify the situation. Court documents state that Jaffe never honored the check.

In August 2008, Jaffe deposited a check for $6,000 into his account and subsequently withdrew $4,500, documents state. The check was returned for insufficient funds.

Jaffe told bank officials that he would make a deposit to make his account current but never did, documents state.

Jaffe is slated to appear in court on June 10.
