
Joshua Dewane Ridenour, 34, 809 Park Lane, Andersonville was arrested Monday and charged with the manufacturing and sale of methamphetamine.

According to information from the Anderson County Sheriff’s Department, deputies went to Ridenour’s Park Lane home to serve arrest warrants for charges of contempt of court and violation of probation. While Ridenour was being taken into custody, deputies reportedly noticed “items used to manufacture meth.” The Sheriff’s Department Special Operations Unit was called to secure the items.

According to the information provided by the Sheriff’s Department, the unit seized 14 “one pot” bottles, two of which were active and cooking the drug. According to various websites a “one pot” bottle for cooking methamphetamine is an empty two-liter plastic bottle. The ingredients are placed into the bottle and shaken to initiate the cooking process. The procedure is reportedly dangerous as the bottles are known to explode and they leave a toxic brown sludge in the bottle that is often disposed of on the side of roads.

The home was cleaned up by investigators and the house was quarantined. It also said that Ridenour has arrest records dating back to 2005.

Ridenour reportedly admitted to making methamphetamine in his home and was booked into the county jail. He is being held on $50,290 bond.
