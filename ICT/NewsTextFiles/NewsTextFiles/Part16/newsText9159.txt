
ROCK ISLAND, Ill. (AP) -- Jury selection continues in the trial of a man accused of killing eight people in 2008.

More alternates will be selected Monday for Nicholas Sheley's third Illinois murder trial. Heading into the weekend, 12 jurors and two alternates had been picked over five days.

The Rock Island County judge overseeing the trial, Jeffrey O'Connor, hasn't indicated publicly how many more alternates he wants. If it's just one or two, opening statements could start later Monday.

The 34-year-old Sheley pleaded not guilty in the deaths of 29-year-old Brock Branson; 20-year-old Kilynna Blake; her 2-year-old son, Dayan; and 25-year-old Kenneth Ulve.

Sheley still faces trial in the deaths of an Arkansas couple found dead in Missouri. He is serving two life sentences for the murders of a Galesburg man and Sterling resident.

There are currently no active polls at this time.
