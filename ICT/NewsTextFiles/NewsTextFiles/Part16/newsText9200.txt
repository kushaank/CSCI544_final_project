
The MBTA bus driver involved in Sunday’s Newton crash that left the bus hanging over the Mass. Pike. has been charged with obstruction of justice.

The charge comes after the MBTA Transit Police reportedly obtained a complaint in Newton District Court.

According to The Boston Globe , T spokesman Joe Pesaturo said the bus contained a surveillance camera, which may help investigators determine what went wrong.

The driver, a 43-year-old woman who is also an 18-year veteran of the MBTA, was hospitalized for non life threatening injuries along with the other seven passengers. Her name has not been released.

She was also cited “for operating to endanger and impeded operation,” according to WHDH .

Investigators were seen leaving the driver’s home Monday afternoon.

According to FOX25 , the driver will be arraigned for the obstruction of justice charge on May 27.
