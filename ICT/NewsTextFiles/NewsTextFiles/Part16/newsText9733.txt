
Last week, Britain’s Prince Harry made a visit to Estonia, while a major NATO training exercise took place in the Baltic state.

The Prince, who has twice served in Afghanistan, spent time meeting the multi-national forces, near the southern Estonian town of Otepaa.

He joked with an old roommate from his time in Afghanistan, and met with President Toomas Hendrik Ilves of Estonia, BBC reports.

«The qualities the whole Estonian Army embodies are something the country can be immensely proud of», he said during the multi-national training called Spring Storm.
