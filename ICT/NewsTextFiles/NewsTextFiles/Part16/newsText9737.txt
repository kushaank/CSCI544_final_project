
The Helmand provincial governor blamed the rebels.

“The Taliban insurgents fired a rocket on Sunday afternoon, which landed on a house, killing three children inside in Nad Ali district,” his office said.

Separately, at least 30 sheep were killed by a bomb placed in a roadside pasture on Monday in the western province of Herat.

Provincial police spokesman Abdul Raouf Ahmadi said Taliban insurgents had planted the bomb to target Afghan security forces’ vehicles.

“Fortunately, nobody was hurt in the bombing,” he said.
