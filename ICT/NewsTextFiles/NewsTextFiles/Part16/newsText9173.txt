
AMHERST, Mass. (WGGB) – A New Hampshire woman is facing her second operating under the influence charge following a weekend incident in Amherst.

Amherst Police Sgt. David Knightly says that around 1:30 p.m. Sunday, police were dispatched after a caller expressed concern that a woman driving a vehicle was intoxicated.

That caller was able to provide police with a description of the car and the woman, and both were located on College Street.

Also in the car was the woman’s 8-year-old son and an adult male, who was seated in the passenger seat.

Knightly adds that after an investigation, officers arrested 34-year-old Liberty Lynn of Merrimack, N.H. on charges of OUI (Liquor) – second offense, operation of a motor vehicle to endanger, child endangerment while under the influence, possession of a Class B substance, and resisting arrest.

Police say that Lynn had reportedly once lived at the complex and was in the area to visit friends.

At her appearance Monday in Eastern Hampshire District Court, no plea was entered and bail was set at $750.  A pre-trial hearing is scheduled for June 18.

The state’s Department of Children and Families has also been called regarding the incident.
