RALEIGH—The mass protest movement ``Moral Mondays'' returns to the North Carolina Legislature this week, as lawmakers work on passing the state budget.

The movement has cast a national spotlight on North Carolina’s General Assembly.

Members of the NAACP and other organizations said they want the General Assembly to repeal last year's laws on unemployment insurance and the election overhaul legislation. They are also calling on state lawmakers to give more money to social programs and expand Medicaid.

• 4:15 p.m.: Organizers will have a press conference at the First Baptist Church on Wilmington Street.

Meanwhile, protesters plan on speaking out about what they call destructive decisions by state lawmakers.
