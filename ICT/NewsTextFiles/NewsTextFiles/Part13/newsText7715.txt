
Negotiators from the 12 countries negotiating the Trans Pacific Partnership are meeting in Singapore this week. Much of the press coverage has focused on differences between the U.S. and Japan over agricultural subsidies that have been difficult to overcome.  However, there have been new developments on intellectual property as it relates to access to medicines.

Negotiators had previously been discussing a differential treatment plan, under which the TPP countries still “developing” would have been exempt from certain obligations on patent and data protection.  This plan is reportedly still on the table.

In order for it to work, negotiators would need to agree on a threshold under which countries would receive differential treatment.  The World  Bank’s “high income” designation was proposed and is still commonly cited as a threshold. Currently, the World Bank considers a country “high income” if it has a GNI per capita of $12,616 or above. Many observers pointed out that middle income countries such as Malaysia and Mexico would soon pass the threshold. (Civil Society commentary on this approach were offered by Brook Baker , James Love , and myself , among others).
