
ISLAMABAD: Legislators in the Upper House of parliament on Monday said that the country is passing through a critical phase, and efforts are being made to make the state institutions’ repute questionable and divide media.

Speaking on the issue, another PPP senator, Farhatullah Babar said that if any news channel commits a mistake and then offers public apology the issue should be discarded. Babar noted that a secret agency has been accused several times in the missing persons’ and other cases. “Banning any media group will be disastrous and threaten democracy,” he warned. He suggested establishment of a committee, which must have all stakeholders including parliamentarians, to probe all such accusations. Opposition leader in Senate Aitizaz Ahsan also said that if any channel commits a mistake and then apologises, the issue should be set aside.
