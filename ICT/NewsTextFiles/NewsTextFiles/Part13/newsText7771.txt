
No nation has accepted a larger number of refugees during the three-year-old Syrian conflict than neighboring Lebanon, where the influx of one million Syrians – 500,000 of whom are children—has overwhelmed the country’s infrastructure.

Lebanon, now home to the greatest concentration of refugees worldwide, is a tiny Middle Eastern nation of only four and a half million people. Like neighboring Jordan, Turkey, and Iraq, it is straining its resources and public services to support Syrian families, including the country’s “lost generation” of children, only about a third of whom are enrolled in school.

In Lebanon, Syrian children work to support their families by selling knick-knacks and flowers, cleaning shoes, or laboring in factories, fields and shops.
