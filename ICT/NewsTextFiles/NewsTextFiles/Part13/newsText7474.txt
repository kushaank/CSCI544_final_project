
The Macau Chief Executive, Fernando Chui Sai On and Portugal’s Minister of State and Foreign Affairs, Saturday signed an addendum to the Framework Cooperation Agreement to make the meeting of the Macau-Portugal Joint Commission an annual event.

The document, which is intended to increase contacts between the two sides with a view to increasing cooperation, was signed on the first day of the visit by Portuguese President, Aníbal Cavaco Silva, to Macau after he visited the People’s Republic of China.

At the end of his visit to Macau Cavaco Silva said that his trip to China had “increased the strategic partnership,” between the two countries and had opened up potential three-way cooperation with Africa and Latin America.

Cavaco Silva’s visit to Macau was essentially cultural as he visited the new campus of Macau University on Hengqin Island, the Portuguese School, the Polytechnic Institute, the Camões Grotto, the Ruins of Sao Paulo and the Cultural Institute.

In all the places he visited the Portuguese head of state noted the importance of the Portuguese language in the world and encouraged students to continue to learn the language and discover Portuguese culture.

Cabo Verde (Cape Verde) is the latest Portuguese-speaking country to attract the attention of major business and financial groups from Angola, which are expanding internationally and have gained prominent positions in telecommunications and banking in the archipelago.
