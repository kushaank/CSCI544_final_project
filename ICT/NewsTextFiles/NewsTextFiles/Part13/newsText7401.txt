MANILA, Philippines - Department of Justice (DOJ) Secretary Leila de Lima on Monday dismissed allegations that she was lawyering for Janet-Lim Napoles.

Escudero, one of the senators linked by Napoles to the scam, also asked why De Lima had to vet, draft, and type the businesswoman's affidavit. He said drafting Napoles' affidavit should have been her lawyer's job.

She said that despite the criticisms she was receiving, she would remain steadfast in her mandate to seek the truth and get to the bottom of the pork scam case.

“I myself do not know what is the truth. I myself do not know kung alin sa mga sinasabi o sasabihin ni Mrs. Napoles ang totoo at di totoo. That’s why I really want to know, we want to know as part of truth seeking mandate. We do not want to vet this in order to aid or assist Mrs. Napoles,” De Lima said.

De Lima said her office was still waiting for Napoles’ camp to submit her “second and longer” affidavit.
