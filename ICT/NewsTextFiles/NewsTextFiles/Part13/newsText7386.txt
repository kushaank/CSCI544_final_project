
For all the brutality with which the TTP is associated, like any Mafioso outfit, it too has to deal with the mundane everyday problems of organisation and rivalries. Mullah Fazlullah had emerged as the consensus pick as leader of the militant outfit after the killing of Hakeemullah Mehsud but he is now emerging as the classic compromise candidate who has neither the force of personality to impose his will nor the abiding support of those he ostensibly leads. It took just one day for the TTP shura to overturn Fazlullah’s sacking of Commander Sajna as TTP chief in South Waziristan. Sajna, who was the favourite to become TTP chief after Mehsud was killed, had been engaged in a pitched battle with Sheharyar Mehsud of the Hakeemullah Mehsud group. Sajna is a protégé of the late Waliur Rehman, and is continuing the battle Rehman had waged against the Mehsuds. So far more than 60 people have died in the clashes and now that Fazlullah has been exposed as a hollow leader we can expect the fighting to continue and even intensify. The TTP chief’s biggest problem is that he is based in Kunar in Afghanistan and seems reluctant to return to the tribal areas. He knows that in Pakistan there is a strong possibility that the military or US drones will target him but the Afghans have let him be as long as he doesn’t interfere in their country.
