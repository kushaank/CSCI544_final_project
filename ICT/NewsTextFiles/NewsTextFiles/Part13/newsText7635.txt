For some time, Americans have been opposed to costly foreign entanglements, certainly those involving U.S. forces, while simultaneously not wanting to look feckless or inept on the world stage. These contradictory sentiments were clear in debate over U.S. involvement in Ukraine and Syria , after territorial disputes in the East and South China Sea, and in debate over defense spending.

So far, the Obama administration has rationalized the necessity of its temperate approach, relying in no small part on the public’s strong preference for limiting the use of force . Regarding Ukraine, the White House has rightly pointed out that Vladimir Putin is the real loser in the long term: Russia is a declining power, annexing Crimea will exacerbate its economic challenges, China and Central Asia are now wary of Moscow, and NATO will be somewhat reinvigorated.

What these approaches miss is that Mr. Putin’s long-term “loss” is not seen as an American “win” and that a long pattern of withholding the American fist in the face of perceived provocations, however rational in each individual case, can tempt others to act opportunistically in the future. This failure in communication has real consequences for deterring al-Qaeda, Syria, North Korea, Iran, China and Russia. Calibrating hard power is difficult but imperative. Perceptions that the U.S. is unwilling to act assertively, whether justified or not, embolden others. Deterrence works best when backed by the credible threat of force. The U.S. is risking that credibility despite its rhetoric, potentially undermining deterrence and increasing the chances that the American public will seek to act at much higher cost down the road, whether on the Korean Peninsula, in the South China Sea, or somewhere we cannot yet predict.

And if in its efforts to avoid another Iraq the White House allows the pendulum of selective engagement to swing too far toward inaction, it risks being knocked over when the pendulum swings back toward overreaction.

A war with Russia is not the answer. The Iraq War was was a hugely expensive tragic mistake.

But the Bush administration made war critics sound like traitors instead of truly debating the sense of it all.

The Iraq War was clearly unsuccessful and destructive.  The ruin of it all lives on.

And I appreciate that President Obama is not inclined to repeat Bush’s pathetic mistake..
