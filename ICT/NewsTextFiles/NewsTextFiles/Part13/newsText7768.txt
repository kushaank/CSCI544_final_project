
TEHRAN (FNA)- Former UN-Arab League Special Envoy for Syria Lakhdar Brahimi, who resigned on May 13, said that an Iranian proposal for the political solution of the Syrian crisis is "worth discussing".

"I told the Security Council the other day, one of the hopeful signs, maybe a straw that you are trying to catch out of this desperate situation, is that the Iranians have been saying let’s get all the foreign fighters out,” Brahimi said in an exclusive interview with Al-Monitor in Washington.

Brahimi, who succeeded Kofi Annan as Syria envoy in September 2012, lamented that divisions in the UN Security Council and the region complicated his diplomacy in support of a political transition in Syria.

"If the Syrians are not capable of solving the problem alone, the first people who can help are the neighborhood, and definitely Iran is part of the neighborhood. So I think we have always been in favor of Iran being involved."

Iran has always stressed that the Syrian crisis cannot be soothed, but through political means and negotaitions.

In November 2012, Iran hosted a meeting between the representatives of the Syrian government and opposition to encourage them to start talks to find a political solution to their problems. The National Dialogue Conference kicked off work in Tehran mid November with the motto of 'No to Violence, Yes to Democracy".

The meeting brought together almost 200 representatives of various Syrian ethnicities, political groups, minorities, the opposition, and state officials.

Syria has been the scene of deadly violence since March 2011. Over 140,000 people have reportedly been killed and millions displaced due to the crisis.
