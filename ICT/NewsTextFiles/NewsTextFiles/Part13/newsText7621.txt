According to the center website , Chabad-Lubavitch promotes the mystical, traditional, legal and social principles of the Torah while using the most modern methods and advanced technologies for education, community outreach, Jewish awareness, crisis intervention, programs, summer camps and community activities.

Starting with Rabbi Schneur Zalman, Chabad- Lubavitch has promoted Jewish education and community activism. The work of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, who assumed leadership of Chabad-Lubavitch in 1950, is renowned, according to officials.

Followers stress that the Rebbe lifted the global Jewish community from the Holocaust, launching a range of Jewish institutions, outreach programs and social services.

Schneor and Estie Greenberg met as young people when she lived in Crown Heights in Brooklyn and he was a student visiting from Israel.

The two eventually married and came to Oakland County a dozen years ago.

Now at the corner of �Commerce and Commerce in Commerce,� the couple is overseeing the construction of the first Jewish synagogue �� Chabad Jewish Center of Commerce �� in the lakes area.

The new Chabad-Lubavitch synagogue, located in a former 1,400-square-foot foreclosed brick home, is expected to open for the High Holidays in September.

The organization will also offer Hebrew school on Sundays.

As explained on the center�s website, Chabad-Lubavitch was founded in 1772 by Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi.

�Chabad��a Hebrew acronym for �Wisdom, Understanding and Knowledge�� is a philosophy of study, meditation, and social outreach that bridges rigorous academics with proactive community involvement. Lubavitch is the town in White Russia where the movement was based for more than a century.

The Russian word �Lubavitch� means �brotherly love,�emblematic of the love and dedication that characterizes Chabad-Lubavitch and its emissaries worldwide.

�Our mission, as taught to us by the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, is to go to an area where there is no established Jewish community and build one� said Schneor, 39.

There are Jewish people around the lakes area, he said, and my goal is to reach and engage every one of them, regardless of background, philosophy or level of commitment. For those who attend services, they would have to drive to West Bloomfield or Southfield. Now there is no more need to shlep (trudge far).

When they came to the region, they first lived in Walled Lake but moved just west of the new synagogue a decade ago, offering Jewish programs and Hebrew classes in their home.

For awhile they held High Holiday services at a storefront location on Commerce Road.

Three years ago the brick house came up for sale and they decided to buy it for a synagogue.

Renovations began in the fall of 2013.

The Chabad has about100 families, said Schneor Greenberg, who with Estie, has eight children.

Diana Freilich of White Lake has been attending services for the past eight years.

�We fell in love with the family,� said Freilich.

The couple encourages people to understand the meanings behind tradition.

By explaining the whys, the �practices take on meaning,� said Estie.

The small renovated home is taking shape, with a sanctuary in the front and classrooms toward the back.

�Right now we wanted a home that is warm and welcoming and inviting,� said Estie.

Rabbi Schneor said he wants the synagogue to symbolize community, with �people getting together, kids going to Hebrew school, and celebrating life cycle events together as a family.
