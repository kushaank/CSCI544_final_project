
Bruce, who has received national attention for his same-sex civil union bill, is the first openly gay legislator in Peru’s history.

High-profile Peruvian congressman Carlos Bruce told daily newspaper El Comercio this weekend that he is gay.

Bruce is probably best known for introducing a same-sex civil union bill in congress.

“Yes, I’m gay, and I’m proud to belong to this group of people that are so valuable to Peru,” Bruce said, speaking to interviewer Mariella Balbi.

El Comercio also spoke to Bruce’s two children, Alex and Paul, who said that they were proud of their father and did not feel that his coming out negatively affected them.
