
On 14-16 May, Angola’s Minister of Energy and Water João Baptista Borges is visiting Sweden with a delegation.

The main focus of the visit is to promote a business exchange between Sweden and Angola. The visit is also a follow-up of of the visits to Angola by Minister for Trade Ewa Björling in May 2013 and Minister for Enterprise Annie Lööf in November 2013.

The programme for the visit includes meetings with the Swedish business community and Swedish agencies and institutes operating in the energy and water sector. Dr Björling will host a lunch in connection with the visit on 16 May.

“I see Angola as a very important trading partner for Sweden, not least in the future. This is also why the Government has named Angola as one of our top-20 prioritised countries for exports and trade-promoting activities,” says Dr Björling.

Sweden’s relations with Angola can be traced back to the time before the liberation struggle. Over the years, our relations have shifted focus from development assistance to trade and investment. Many of the areas in which Sweden has a great deal of expertise are areas in which we previously provided bilateral development assistance. Angola is a good example of how bilateral cooperation can be broadened and further developed through existing relations that have been cultivated over many years.
