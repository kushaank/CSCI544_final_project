
Taiwan's Ministry of Health and Welfare offers 24-hour psychological consultation services through a toll free number to Taiwanese people returning from protest-plagued Vietnam, though there are not as many Taiwanese passengers as originally expected, according to the Civil Aeronautics Administration.

The ministry said that the service can be reached at 0800-788-995.

Those who were injured in Vietnam will be reimbursed for their medical expenses as long as the applicant keeps all related receipts and files them within six months, the ministry said.

The administration said that as of Sunday (May 18), more than 600 seats were still available for Taiwanese people in Vietnam who want to return to Taiwan. The number of vacant space is much higher than originally anticipated.

China Airlines, Mandarin, EVA, UNI Air, and Vietnam Airlines had a total of 11 flights between Vietnam and Taiwan but the administration said that there were plenty of vacancies. China Airlines, for example, had two flights but only 60% of the seats were taken, the administration said.

The Tourism Bureau, meanwhile, said that a total of 93 Taiwanese visitors will fly to Vietnam for sightseeing on May 19.

Anti-Chinese protests began on May 13, when Vietnamese protesters began to vandalize factories, offices and shops in response to China's display of force over an oil rig drilling in disputed waters in the South China Sea. Vietnamese protesters destroyed or damaged all facilities owned or operated by those of Chinese background, including Taiwanese-owned property. Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to print stickers that read "I am a Taiwanese" and distribute them to Taiwanese people in Vietnam to avoid being swept up in the riot.
