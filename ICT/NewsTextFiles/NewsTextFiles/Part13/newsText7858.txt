
Ambassador John Bolton, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, believes the U.S. needs to strengthen its strategy to handle the rising threat of terrorism in North Africa. He sees terrorists like Nigeria’s Boko Haram posing a “direct threat” to American interests.

Fox News National Security Analyst KT McFarland spoke to Bolton about recent militant activity in the region.

Bolton says Nigeria’s inability to stop Boko Haram early on has allowed the extremists to expand their network into neighboring countries.

Even though the threat by Boko Haram and other Al Qaeda-affiliated groups might seem far from the U.S., Bolton says Americans must take notice.
