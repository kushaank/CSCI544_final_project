
KARACHI: A local magistrate dismissed a case of illicit arms registered against US citizen, Joel Cox Eugene, who was arrested in Karachi earlier this month, SAMAA reported.

Reports said Judicial Magistrate Malir accepted an application of defence counsel of the accused who presented a letter of US embassy.

The letter stated that the US citizen has been allowed to keep arms with him.

The man was arrested at Karachi airport minutes before he was to fly to Islamabad. Police said arms and ‘spy gadgets’ were found from his possession.

A case of illegal arms was registered against him. However, he was released on bail.

According US media reports, the man works for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the key investigation and intelligence agency of the US.

A district judge in Karachi, Hasan Ali Kalwar, quashed the case after police failed to present any evidence against the agent.

The judge said police had invoked an incorrect section of the law.

"He was not carrying any weapon but was carrying only the bullets and magazines," Kalwar was quoted as saying by a court official.

Police did not pursue the case after the interior ministry informed them that the agent was authorised to carry the ammunition, police officer Khalid Mehmood told AFP.
