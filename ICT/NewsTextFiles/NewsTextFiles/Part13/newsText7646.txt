While the US also raised questions about the troop’s withdrawal and according to Reuters the Pentagon said it had seen “no indication” of Russian troop movement away from the border.

But the clash between the pro Russian separatist militants in eastern Ukraine and the Ukraine government forces have continued where one Ukraine soldier was killed and one more injured on Monday in an attack.
