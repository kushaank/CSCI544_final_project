
In a recent article in Foreign Policy magazine (online) by Trita Parsi of NIAC, "No, Sanctions Didn't Force Iran to Make a Deal" , Parsi very reasonably suggested that although it totally looks like it, it was not in fact the result of US sanctions that has surprisingly brought Iran to the bargaining table. Even though everyone on both sides pretty much thinks it did.

I always like reading Parsi's articles. They are always full of funny facts, are generally really well argued, and easy to completely disagree with. Which if you don't have a PhD like I don't, tends to make you feel smart. For a while, at least.

Parsi suggested that not only did the US sanctions have NO effect in convincing Iran to reconsider its anti-US, never gonna negotiate with 'em stance, but that the Sanctions also had nothing to do with Rouhani winning his lottery-- I mean election.

This may be the one and only time that I find myself in complete agreement with Trita! My head is spinning!

Firstly the election. If you could read Farsi, and knew which version of the Iranian Constitution to read (1979? 1989? 1903?), you would know that the "Iranian election", actually isn't one. Any exercise conducted by the Interior Ministry which incidentally and conveniently also runs the Secret Police, that counts the votes and then reports the results, is a far far far "thing" from an election.

Never mind that the "Candidates" carefully chosen by Caesar, and then sent to the Coliseum for the Romans to tell Caesar which direction Caesar should point his thumb, well, let's admit it, an Iranian election renders unto Caesar what is pretty much Caesar's.

By Caesar, of course I mean King Khamenei I. Or by now, maybe he is Khamenei the Grape. Certainly he is the most Holy Shi(i)t(e) I know.

Although there are numerous Farsi language examples on video and in print, clearly stating so, Trita seems to suggest that from the English language sources he chooses to use at least, no examples of Rouhani suggesting the "campaign" promises to get rid of the sanctions were used to win "votes" in the "election". (Trita, FYI the Farsi word for Sanctions is "Tahreem", look it up, you'll find a thousand references to it exactly during the election you think, was one).

To digress further, in order to define what an election is: a real proper election is one in which the "wisdom of the crowd" chooses freely from among the best and wisest choices a society freely serves up, in order to find a leader who under rules and regulations, manages the affairs of the citizenry to the best of his ability. Do his job well, and the usual reward is another go at it. Wash, Rinse, Repeat.

The Iranian election is more along the lines of; Monkey Say, Monkey See, and then the Monkeys endorse that decision out of fear of becoming ex-Monkeys. There are the obvious Sheep and Shepherd metaphors one can make too, but this is after all a children's program.

Again, I have to once again throw up a bit in my mouth, swallow, and completely agree with Parsi, who rejects the US suggestion that Sanctions affected the Iranian election results, and helped bring Rouhani a self and Supreme Leader advertised moderate, and damn good actor to the world stage. Sanctions certainly did not do that. Khamenei did.

And Iranians certainly agree with Khamenei. Especially when he tells them to. No surprise then, that the numerous polls that Parsi suggests were not biased by a little bit of this intimidation of the populace, and little bit of that total domination of every part of Iranian life, not surprisingly reported that 96% of Iranians would gladly accept sanctions in order to keep developing nuclear technology "for peaceful purposes". Shoot, I'd believe that an Iranian government conducted poll would say 98% of Iranians would say, "Hell, give us more sanctions, we eat 'em for breakfast! With torshi they're positively delish!"

I haven't seen numbers so convincing since Saddam's overwhelming election turnout!

What I would add to Trita's Terrorific Treatise however (OK that one was unavoidable!), is that above all, you cannot and should not trust any people under oppression. Ever. Especially when their oppressors are smiling this much.

Which brings us to the not so delicate, Mr. Zarif.

So disappointed was Mr. Zarif with the US, and the entire proposition of American life in general, that after attending a really really really expensive and ultra toney College Prep School, and then attending San Francisco State, he had to make sure he really hated the US by getting a second degree from the University of Denver.

You have no choice to be nut-shottedly impressed with someone that can at once not only effectively represent the "other side", but do it while really being on your side. What is certain is that no one is exactly sure whose side Mr. ZarifÂ  is on. Except of course Mr. Zarif. Which makes him of course, entirely trustworthy. I guess. Because he smiles a lot.

This of course, all goes without saying. Because if you were to say it, you would then have to also think of saying but never actually say, words like "Hypocrite" and "Self Serving Sell Out". But thankfully, because Mr. Zarif is the exemplification of character and honesty and sincerity, because he damn well went into the belly of the US beast and had the courage to leave it and his children behind, thankfully, we don't have to say that. Because the Americans, like him. And that's what's important. I know you think Iranian freedom is important, but not as important as being liked by the Americans now. I mean, come on, grow up!

Finally, I have to slap my own face and call myself "Sally", and again agree with Trita, that it was not the US sanctions that brought Iran to the table, but the 19,000 centrifuges humming in unison like a seeneh-zani procession in Qommmmmm, that brought the US to the sofreh, that Iran has carefully cheed. And like Persian food always does, Americans are always easily impressed by nothing more exotic than Ghormeh Sabzi. And how fluffy our rice is.

And thank god Iran is developing all this nuclear technology for cancer victims! Although I haven't seen any, I am sure that the millions of poor Iranian children suffering from this cruel haramzadeh, will finally be cured by the glorious Islamic-Iranian doctors combined with heroic Islamic-Iranian cancer researchers, working together to get these nuclear warhea-- I mean isotopes where they can do the most dama-- Dehhh! I mean-- good.

Keep writing Trita, keep writing. Before your insights, we Iranians were standing at the edge of a tall cliff. But thanks to your imaginative rearrangement you've allowed us all to take one giant step forward.

No, He's a King. He has taken power illegally and solidified his position for life, and makes al the necessary absolute ruler decisions. Kind of like Reza Khan except absent any patriotism and thoughtfulness. Khamenei is a self appointed Supreme Ruler of Iran, for life.

This is of course a far thing from what you are suggesting.

amirparvizforsecularmonarchy – I Love Waterfalls and Find One of the most humorous things in the world; is the notion that Americans are a greater force for good & more civilized than Nazi's, Mullahs and Communists.

Not at all.  To start he is a Dictator because he has absolute power, he has used it and continues to uses it.  This makes him unlike a King which acts within the frame work of laws with limits to his power or her power in the case of a Queen.  Staying in power for life does not make him like a King, but more like the interests that elect Presidents.  The power structure that selects who are the nominee's for each party to be their candidate for president namely the democratic party and the republican party are each very effectively controlled by the dictatorship running the USA.  The Presidential Process in the USA is effectively in power for life, for those that control the candidates of both parties and are a member of neither.  This is the backbone of US dictatorship on who's behalf each and every elected President acts as a Dictator for.  Unless his son successfully claims his position of power based on being the son of Khamenei he is not a King.  I think it is obvious he is not yet like Reza Khan even with out patriotism and surrounding himself with nationalists and patriots.   Reza Khan never claimed power unlawfully.  He was elected by Irans patriots, land owners and the parliament after the King was away in Europe and did not want to come back to the job and the people wanted a King, despite his openly republican views, which thank god did not come to pass or have support.

He's an evil king then.

amirparvizforsecularmonarchy – I Love Waterfalls and Find One of the most humorous things in the world; is the notion that Americans are a greater force for good & more civilized than Nazi's, Mullahs and Communists.

He's a Dictator.

Kings really have a tough time ever being able to use absolute power as Dictators do because they have not come in to power by partnering with other people based on what power they can lend the King and leaving all principals aside in reality, which happens in democratic systems.

I say we leave it as Khamenei is acting like any good President, that orders his army to treat the people of his country as the enemy after an election usurpation, George Bush used the armed forces as thugs when the people rebelled against the Rodney King Trial.

Monarchy unless it develops a democratic culture for the people will not with freedom alone be able to stop a social decay, leading to decline from within at the hands of religious bigots or communists that regress and thwart modernity attacking freedom.  People having power is very important, more so than elections and who is in power, people if they have power can replace elites in a single party system that allows multiple ideologies.  My only problem with it is that in such a system the King would then be ceremonial and the single party more in control and potentially leading to the same unproven system that can't even follow the rule of law as western democracy only follows the rule of the jungle.

If the Islamic regime had the support of even as much as 25% of Iranians inside Iran, it would cope with sanctions for many more years to come without capitulating to the west the humiliating  way it is doing now. Case in example Cuba, which has been under much more severe sanction for much longer and is standing firm.

Behrouz Bahmani – Doves may Cry, but Chickens Bleed.

You are suggesting that sanctions have hurt the Iranian economy and Iranians.

The Iranian economy has been a disaster since the beginning, ad the US sanction haven't done 100th as much damage as bad internal government policies have. Comes with the territory when your economic policy is take from the rich and give it to political allies, and use oil to feed the poor. Or Islamic Marxism. And like all Marxism, it works for a while, but very soon the Super Class  entrusted to keep the system going, themselves are corrupted by their power which leads to personal greed. This is Iran today.

The other point I will argue is that the Iranian people have not really suffered from the US sanctions per se, because those sanctions NEVER affected the goods and services that Iranians need to buy directly. You know, food. That has been inflated in price by the Bazar who use it as an excuse to raise prices of goods on Iranians. The Bazar makes Iranians pay in order to cover the increase in trouble and cost they are facing from the sanctions which makes their ability to get all of their money out of Iran, converted to dollars, and sent to banks around the world.

Proof? With the reduction/easing of the US sanctions, the exchange rate in Iran has not budged. More Proof? In 2013 Porsche announced the highest number of cars sold in the Mid-East were sold in Iran. Annually Porsche makes 50 limited edition cars. 12 have already been sold to Iran.

That's not a country "Suffering" from US sanctions.

Loved it and laughed through it, too.

I beg to differ when it comes to Cesare(I like the Italian sound better!). He was a true reformist and was despised and eventually assassinated for being one. His spirit must be looking down from heavens and pointing his index finger at you saying, "Anche tu?"

I'm referring to Julius, who like Khamenei caused and presided over the eventual collapse of the Roman Empire.

You should post it on Hawaian.com. This is Iranian.com. We are Iranians. Analogies however appropriate are entirely useless on us. We think we know a better way to go from point A to point B, that does not involve actually any Iranian actually getting up, packing, or even leaving their house.

I think the article has more value for all Iranians to understand how democratic systems work "in reality".

I like Monarchy over Democracy as a system of Government.  I am not opposed to high participation ceremonial democracy, where people vote freely and fairly and the electoral results are accurately shared and hold no legal value, such a system would have greater participation than in the west, because the people would not be making their choices based on deceit, coercion and manipulation and so they will be eager to have their say and the moral impact that their say will have.

What I want to see is a Free Iran the way monarchies has achieved in the past, with a large middle class of people that are overall wealthy.  While I disagree in Democratic Government, I agree with Democratic Society and Culture, so people with their communication and freedom can inform one another to act on issues free of manipulation, coercion and deceit, so if the mosque doesn't allow dogs, then everyone write a letter to the mosque saying we want dog access until their voice is heard and they have had their say.

People I believe need to fight over values and not with one another in personal attacks.  If Iranians were discussing and attacking views not each other, then by doing that it would be for me the democratic culture I seek.  I put up articles like the one above because I would like Iranians to decide what they want and not after only listening to the two-faced hypocrites of both sides of "democratic governments" who become unelectable if they do not show they believe in democratic government and in practice help to enslave the people to ideals.  Slavery doesn't work for my version of humanity, neither does building a future creatively based on a foundation of lies.  I can say that western values in practice are not what I support.  I actually believe in freedom and justice for all, unlike mullahs or democratic system supporters.

I dislike civilizations that act tyrannically and despotically running the world based on a revolving Dictatorship.  For me, No to "Western Democratic Systems" and No to their illegitimate Creation "the IRI".  The diabolical politics as taught by machiavelli and practiced by all the major religions not just Islam has been perfected by western democracies and works sadly based on giving people the ability to choose.  The problem is that when the truth is covered up from the consensus and they are given a rigged choice you get the uncivilized savagery we see with the USA and IRI alike.  So the system I support removes the choice and gives you the next king with no election at all.

So one then is left with the choice of.... is it better to have a choice with coercion, manipulation and deceit and the people not know how deeply misguided they are or is it better to have less choices, but those few choices left be genuine.  For now this is all purely theoretical for Iranians in Iran, as with Islamic government we have no choice at all, clean or otherwise.  I want the Iranian people to have more of a purpose for their lives than to use their back sides for the target practice of the Dictatorship in Power, how about you?  The Iranian adage that sums up this wisdom is, "kooneh adamizad, sakhteh nashodeh keh bejangeh ba shakheh gaav."  The IRI is the "shakeh gaav" and it can be brought down with out violence, there is one group, Monarchists, that can do it.

I never met any Iranian or a human being that will ever face a landslide with stubbornness, violence or any kind of force, the IRI are no different, they must not have a choice and 90% of Iran can bring them to a standstill, if the action is done with the leadership of a King and peacefully bringing them to a standstill.  All the foreign mercenaries they have targeted on Iranians will not be able to do a thing.  However the Leader has to be the defender of Iranian Pre-islamic Culture as well as Iranian post Islamic Culture, like the late King was.  The power of Nowruz and our traditions is stronger than you know and it crosses borders that Islam never could, because unlike Islam it is genuinely based on Love.

While I support a ceremonial monarchy, I do agree that this evolved state of Homo-Iranus still yearns for a "Strong Pahlavan to magically come and save us from our plight..."

Unfortunately Khamenei and his gang of merry bandits also knows about this, and so they quickly seek out and kill off anyone that even remotely looks like they live next door to, or on the same city block as anything resembling a hero.

But I love the fact that at least you are dreaming! Dreaming is healthy!

This reminds me of the US elections where in 2000, another unelected and supreme element (the Supreme Court) chose the President by literally ending the vote count.

As Stalin said:  "It does not matter who votes, only who counts the votes."

controlled by the Supreme Court, are no more democratic than Iranian elections.

When money rules, we have oligarchy, plutocracy, and kleptocracy.

When there is a Supreme Leader or Court, which is unaccountable, we have absolute power, which is absolutely corrupt.

In speaking of the failures and hypocrisies of others, we should first acknowledge our own.

Behrouz Bahmani – Doves may Cry, but Chickens Bleed.

The corruption of an American vote does not make the Iranian (S)election clean.

Your comment is appropriate for American.com. This is Iranian.com, we should aspire to improve and perfect Iran, not compare and contrast in order to excuse our own failings.

If in 2013 you said "Wow Iran elected a moderate President!", you were wrong twice. a) Iranians did not elect Rouhani, they selected him from the list Khamenei gave them to choose from. b) Rouhani is a mollah. Which is the opposite of reform.

When Rouhani takes off his turban and wears a suit, I'll barely consider him a possible reformer. He will still be Khamenei's stooge, but I'll accept his repentance.

Until then, Rouhani is a lying mollah. By his own admission.

I did not say that America's corrupt elections make Iran's acceptable. My point was that we cannot make judgements in a vacuum, and that if we condemn the Iranian democratic process as a sham, we must see that in a context of equally sham elections in the US and other nations.

All meaningful judgements about politics are comparative.  Are we free? We need to define freedom and then compare nations to find out where we stand.

My role, as an American, is to remind people that people who live in glass houses should not throw stones.

Many Americans will read your criticism of Iran's elections and think that they are lucky to live in a democracy with clean elections. This kind of thinking leads to the hubris which results in thinking we have the right to overthrow regimes, whether in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Ukraine, or Syria or Iran.

Therefore, to insure that our criticisms are seen in a broader context, we must use comparisons to avoid such conclusions and such hubris.

My point:  Iranian elections are a sham and so are elections in the US, so let's not jump to the conclusion that the US has the right to promote regime change.

standards across the globe.   I reject your insistance that comparing Iran's elections to US elections's is irrelevant:  it serves the critical purpose of preventing us from believing that we in the US are justified in overthrowing the Iranian leaders, as we have believed (catastrophically) in Afganistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria, the Ukraine and Iran.

Behrouz Bahmani – Doves may Cry, but Chickens Bleed.

No, I respectfully disagree. We don't need anymore test results. The case is closed. This system of Islamic Marxism has failed miserably, and has been bad not just for Iran, but for Islam proper. This is a bad idea all around. We knew it in 1979, and 1984 and 1989, and as late as 2009, but we didn't do anything about it.

And apparently we are still going to wait. Now for the two worst enemies of the Iranian people, to make "an historic deal".

Vaghean, God help us!

Your suggestion of including world modern history in the Iranian equation, and that Israel or the US or Syria makes the equation more complex, is precisely the problem I aim to illustrate. That suggested equation factors in the Iranian government as the key player in deciding to reform.

I don't see any incentive there. and my point is the deciding factor should be what free Iranian people, free from interference, threats, oppression, and enforced bias, should aspire to have as a governance system.

But you are right, If we leave it up the the government to reform itself, they will bring all the excuses in the world why they should not reform at this time, "because right now there are too many enemies trying to destroy us".

NONE of these so called enemies are trying to destroy the Iranian people. Whoa re the real true representation of Iran. Not some theoretical concocted religious variation of Marxism.

We are not Marxists. We are bazaris. We invented haggling, the mall, and the holiest concept of all, not ever paying retail!

I notice that in your list of evil Iranians, you exclude the most brutal of all, the Shah.   You also seem to have a bad case of anti-Marxism.

I think you are way off base about both the effects of the sanctions and the "so-called enemies."

A gallop poll a year ago found that " A majority of Iranians (56%) say sanctions the United Nations, the U.S., and Western Europe imposed have hurt Iranians' livelihoods a great deal."  You appear to deny this.

Also, American neo-cons are not "so-called" enemies; they want to bomb Iran in some cases with nukes.

McCAin famously sang "Bomb, bomb, bomb bomb Iran..." to sadistic laughter a few years back. REcently, Shelden Adleson has called for dropping a nuclear bomb in the desert to intimate the Iranian leaders and people, and Dick Cheney, war criminal, talked about bombing Iran just last month.

If the Republicans win the next election such war mongers will be in charge again, and the people of Iran have just cause to fear the wrath of Americans who are dying to bomb Iran.

Several studies have shown that in wars, about 90% of the people killed are civilians.

Clinton's sanctions against Iraq in the 90's caused the deaths of 500,000 children under age 5.

In conclusion, you seem to dismiss the threat of American actions, from sanctions which deprive the people of a livelihood to nuclear bombs.  You appear to think those making such threats are not really enemies.

I respectfully think you are deluded in your thinking.   I will continue to support all efforts to reach diplomatic solutions with the current government because I don't think we will have a better chance.

The biggest threat Iran faces today is the lust of the war mongers in Israel and the US to unleash the dogs of war.  It's time you wake  up to that fact and quit whining about "Marxists," and leave that kind of red-baiting to the fascists.

Behrouz Bahmani – Doves may Cry, but Chickens Bleed.

There are two reasons I exclude the Shah, neither of them for the reason you think.

1) The Shah is dead. And therefore irrelevant given we are living in the present.

2) The Shah do not do as much damage to Iran statistically as this government has. Look up Iran's current GDP before and after, from a human rights and political imprisonment basis, it's not even close.

You seem to be a comparison fiend eager to excuse Iran because you think by comparing it to the flaws in the US, that somehow makes it OK for Iran to suck this bad. I challenge you not to think that way. It makes Iran stay sucky.

"The contents of the Articles of the Constitution related to the Islamic character of the political system; the basis of all the rules and regulations according to Islamic criteria; the religious footing; the objectives of the Islamic Republic of Iran; the democratic character of the government; the wilayat al-'mr the Imamate of Ummah; and the administration of the affairs of the country based on national referenda, official religion of Iran [Islam] and the school [Twelver Ja'fari] are unalterable."

So the Shah's brutal dictatorship can be excluded from Iranian history because he is dead.  Guess what: so is Khomeini (for nearly 25 yrs).

Historians do not disregard historical events because the players are dead.  That is the lamest excuse not to mention that the govt you despise arose out of disgust at the US puppet and mass murderer Shah Pahlavi.  I am getting a scent of a political ideology on your part which uses double  standards to judge leaders and regimes.

Your second claim, that the Shah did less harm ("statistically"???) than the current government (ignoring that there has been a change in the government recently), is very questionable.  He was a monarchy who was cornonated; his secret police were brutal, and he was a puppet of the CIA. In 1975, he formed a one-party sytsem with compulsory dues and membership (totalitarianism).

To point out the brutality and puppet status of the Shah is not to defend the government since, which you keep falsely pinning on me.

My position is that I despise theoracies AND monarchies, I detest brutality whether done by a corrupt and brutal puppet or a religious leader.   It is a logical fallacy on your part to infer that because I object to the double standard you employ, that I am defending Iranian policies.

What I do defend is the need for those who are calling for the bombing and regime change in Iran to be exposed as dangerous and hypocritical monsters since their own nations (US and Israel) are both sham democracies which need regime change more than any other nation on earth, due to their history of aggression.

I do support working diplomatically with the current Iranian regime, since it is the only one in recent times to have tried moderation and diplomacy.  If diplomacy does not win, war will.

Those you have called "so-called enemies" will destroy Iran as they have destroyed Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria.  The main victims will be the Iranian people.

You attribute to me, most dishonestly, that I am claiming that diplomacy will work magic.  Sir!  Stop putting words in my mouth: that is a form of lying.

You should keep in mind that each time the US has invaded and destroyed a country in recent history, it has turned a secular government into an Islamic government.  The US in 2011 sold 60 billion in weapons to the fascist Islamic monarchy of Saudi Arabia and is now selling (or brokering deals for private corps to sell: a feature of corporate fascism)  weapons to Iraq, or anyone who will buy them.

A Harvard study of 2000 arms races in history found that in 98% of the cases, the result is war.  The US is the largest arms dealer in the world and thus is most responsible for raging wars.

Iran is a target, just as Iraq and Libya and Syria were, because it is independent of Western hegemony.  Independence is not allowed.

Nor is having no or low debt.  Libya had zero debt, and that is unacceptable to the world bankers, who need nations to be desperate for loans, so they (the IMF) can control these nations.

The latest example is Ukraine.

Iran is a target not because it has nukes, which it does not, not because it's government has authoritarian features (far less than Israel, Saudi Arabia, and most MD nations)--since the US supports dozens of dictatorship worldwide and has a history of killing elected leaders who seek independence--but rather because it refuses to bow down to the West and its imperial desire to control the entire world.

This is not by any means a defense of Iranian abuses of power but a reminder that abusing power is hardly a reason to target a nation--that the reasons are rather the inability of the West to accept the idea of independence or neutrality (this led to the War on Vietnam, in which the US killed 5 million civilians, 1 million children).

I get a hint that you are coming down on the side of the war-mongers, that you are a rabid anti-Marxist. In fact, the brutal Shah was overthrown by a workers revolution which was then hijacked by the religious establishment.

Could NOT agree with you more!   The treasonous Shah did far more harm than even Khomeini...after all he is/was responsible and the impetus or corner stone of the theocracy and the Akhoonds that we are witnessing and suffering from, today!   And that as far as I am concerned is one catastrophic historical misstep or incident, intentional or otherwise.

A well-written article. A Ph D. is not a prerequisite for good writing, donâ€™t believe me, read my article that is posted in this page beneath yours and I do have one! You may not have a Ph D. but you are a brilliant writer.

My Only criticism of Trita is that he and the rest of NIAC people have a tendency to blame the U.S. for all the problems in Iran thus implicitly exonerate the IRI from any fault and wrong doing.

I think it is pretty clear that Mr. Parsi is pretty much a mouthpiece for the Iranian government which is understandable...they need all the help with their image they can get. But it's also clear that crippling economic sanctions have pushed the government to the bargaining table because of the long-term negative effects on the general population, which has been exacerbated by a perceived wealth gap between the favored elite of the government who have access to foreign currency reserves, while the everyday citizen suffers greatly. This in large part led the large scale demonstrations and activism that occurred over the past two elections. As a bone to this discontentment, the government has postured to make a show of moderation, which is illusory given the fact that ultimate power still rests in the religious leadership of the Supreme Leader.

While Mr. Parsi and NIAC and other similar Iran lobbying efforts might yield some benefits, they are a fig leaf in covering up the most serious shortcomings of the Iranian government which the world still readily sees through.

I'm not sure of that.

I am sure that I have met many free-Iranians like Parsi who like the Iranian people are simply exhausted from expecting Iran to change. So they advocate "patient waiting" as their response to their disappointment.

This is of course naive, when the enemy knows this about you. Which the Iranian government knows this about us. We are lazy when it comes to changing our own fate by our own hands. I mean just look. Supposedly, Iranians are highly intelligent and highly educated yet no one seems to be able to figure out how to solve our "problem". Even with the obvious answers right in front of our faces!

So there are those who now, see US talks and think this will somehow lead to reform. Albeit slowly.

Looking at the Constitution that Khamenei wrote specifically to seal power in the hands of the clerics forever, I don't see how that is possible.

I honestly think no one has read the C, and gets this very simple legal point. I think people think that there is a some magical procedure that allows a majority of politicians to politely suggest changes that can then be put into place if no one gets too upset by them, and that this is how Iran can slowly change and carefully take "small bites" out of the Clerical pie and before you know it, Iran will be healed.

I don't see how that is possible, the way I read the C. especially when Khamenei specifically wrote it that way, in order to prevent such activities.

First, there is NO clause or procedure that allows the C to be changed. It used to have "amendment procedures", in the 1979 version. But not this 1989 version. Khamenei illegally removed those paragraphs.

ANY suggestion that this C needs modification is not only a sin, but automatically receives the Apostasy sentence, because to seal it tight, Khemenei declared the C a "perfect document". there are only two perfect documents in existence. This C, and the Qoran. Suggesting it is imperfect, well that makes you an apostate. Or in modern terms a felon.

So, given there is no power sharing procedure in the C, and ANY attempt to modify it, is a sin, we can wait for the US and Iran to sign all sorts of deals we want, but the C which is the basis of all common law in Iran, can never be changed. And Iran is condemned to be ruled by some form of religious Supreme Leader, forever and ever, Amen.

Oh, and in case you are wondering, even the Supreme Leader cannot declare the C invalid or obsolete. that is when the Guardian Council earns their keep and merely selects a better Supreme Leader. Since the GC is made up of really hard liners, this ensures that one of them ALWAYS "backs the plan" to rule Iran from the pulpit. And not the senate. They consider this their duty to protect Iran from politics.

After several shots, I could even agree with that!

But ere is the final clause of our glorious C, that we ALL sat lazy and stupid and allowed to be written in, sealing our fate forever.

"The contents of the Articles of the Constitution related to the Islamic character of the political system; the basis of all the rules and regulations according to Islamic criteria; the religious footing; the objectives of the Islamic Republic of Iran; the democratic character of the government; the wilayat al-'mr the Imamate of Ummah; and the administration of the affairs of the country based on national referenda, official religion of Iran [Islam] and the school [Twelver Ja'fari] are unalterable."

I will repeat the only word you need to remember: unalterable.

Thanks! From a PhD no less, it is an honor. The biggest problem I have with Trita and NIAC is that a) they are unauthorized and nothing more than a members only politics club, and b) they are occasionally reckless with their naive analyses.

Watch for my next article to see how.

Unauthorized and illegal; Always reckless.  NaÃ¯ve?  No, Trita hopes we are naÃ¯ve while he is cunning and in search of the sanctions breaking payday from his mullah masters in Iran.

I'm not sure of that. I will give them the benefit of the doubt and suggest that they are more along the lines of the "Exhausted Iranian" thinking Iran will reform after it makes friends with the US again. Albeit slowly.

I don't see that. See my long winded reply to Ajax above.

The primary problem with the Parsi-Dai feud is this. Both failed to either defend themselves, or to destroy the other's claims. So at best it was a huge waste of time and money, for an entirely inconclusive tie.

Which makes them both idiots for even trying.

Arvand Rud – Arvand Rud is the proper name of the "Shatt al Arab". Let's just say I would never sell out Iran to the mullahs or the communists.

The Islamic Republic regime knows exactly how to use American liberals to spread their propaganda. They have networks of former government officials, reporters, university professors and other paid personalities that the regime regularly taps into when the mullahs want to manipulate the discussion in their favor.

The mullahs, for the last forty years, have been masters at using western liberals' guilt to inadvertently turn them into regime apologists.

While most Iranians share the view along with their liberal western counterparts that the neocons are a bunch of warmongering, racist, conservatives ( like our own right wing religious extremists), and we don't want sanctions or war either....I believe certain liberals in the west are prone to become regime apologists in their quest to avert a war.

This is certainly not true of all of the left...but there are some liberals who will go as far as to say things like: ''Most Iranians love the Islamic Republic and the expats ( some 10 million Iranians who escaped the mullahs) are just biased and deluded''.

We all know what most people think about this regime. We are in constant contact with millions of our family, friends and former colleagues back home and regularly discuss the miserable state of people under this murdering government. Many of us also regularly travel back and forth to Iran. Its not secret that 85 % of the population hates the mullah mafia. Just ask real people.

We only ask that our western liberal friends support the people of Iran and not inadvertently become regime apologists in their efforts to stop a march to war.

Supporting the human rights of the Iranian people is a just and moral undertaking. America is NOT going to attack Iran over ''human rights violations and humanitarian concerns''. We can point out the regime's crimes all day and night. America doesn't care.

We all know what would compel them to use military aggression. Money.

I would also like us to stop accepting the constant false "threat of War" that people keep talking about as if it is even a reality. It isn't. Just like the idea that the US can ever stop Iran from building a bomb.

2) Iran is going to get one, or already has a nuclear bomb.

That is the ONLY logical explanation for the sudden warmth in relations. And Israel's surprising quietness throughout all of this. It's over. Now the US needs to find a way to keep Iran's trigger finger relaxed. And the best way to do that would be to tell Israel to "Shush deh!", while the US becomes friendly with Iran.

Replace election with SELECTION, and you are right. clearly Khamenei CHOSE Rouhani as a more easy going President than someone like Ahmadinejad who only pissed off the US.

Just as long as you don't suggest the Iranian people FREELY ELECTED Rouhani, we can call it anything you like. Except an election.

In the absence of freedom appointments are more relevant than elections, elections are shows or alibi of legitmacy for dictators, which they are Illegitamte.

But not free elections. Free elections or the expression of "the Wisdom of the Crowd" by free people is the most civilized way to assign accountable authority to officials who must adhere to rules established to ensure sound governance, with procedural safeguards in place  to avoid any funny business and provide a way to remove bad or incompetent behavior. Usually handled by the next election.

Part of our problem, is that we think there is no way to set up the game so that the players can play fairly, and in which the people don't get screwed over.

We Iranians like to avoid that hard work of "effective game design", and instead all too easily we prefer to hand it off to a "benevolent hero" and hope his ego will prevent him from becoming corrupt. He always does, and our laziness in not designing the gam the way WE want it to be played, is our constant cost to bear.

The good news is we can afford to be lazy, as long as we are not stupid. Because there are many "games" already designed, with perfect rules that we  can install that will allow us to put someone in charge without the risks of him turning into a tyrant the first day on the job.

The problem today, is that Iranians are apparently both lazy and stupid. I know you will not like to hear this, hell, I hate saying it, but I am too old and tired of sugar coating our condition anymore. I cannot excuse our condition by blaming the US either. It's our own damn fault. We are this educated, and we should by now have known better.

We should know that we are in charge. Not our jailers.

Yes, Julius Caesar was assassinated as a result of the collapse of Roman Empire, and the desire to eliminate a despotic ruler who was conveniently blamed by the politicians who wanted to take power away from a monarchy, for all of Rome's decline.
