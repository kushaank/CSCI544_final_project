
A member of the House Minority Bloc on Monday said the Pasig river ferry service should be operated by the private sector.

House Deputy Minority Leader and LPG-MA Rep. Arnel Ty urged the National Economic Development Authority’s Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Center and the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) to bid out the Pasig River Metro Ferry Service to the private sector.

“Our sense is, many large private investors will likely be attracted to build and operate a highly developed Pasig River Metro Ferry Service, especially if the concession will include the right to exploit the passenger terminals for commercial purposes,” said Ty, a member of the House committee on transportation.

The past ferry operator ran the service from March 2007 to December 2010 but gave up after incurring 94 million in losses due to low ridership amid rising fuel costs, according to the Commission on Audit.

Last month, the Chairman Francis Tolentino of the Metro Manila Development Authority launched an improvised ferry service using five small non-airconditioned boats to cover five stations: Pinagbuhatan in Pasig City; Guadalupe in Makati City; and Sta. Mesa, Escolta and Plaza Mexico in Manila.

“We welcome the MMDA’s initiative. However, we doubt that the MMDA, on its own, can sustain the service,” Ty said.
