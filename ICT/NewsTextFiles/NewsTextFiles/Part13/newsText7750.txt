
Swedish director Ruben Östlund was hailed by film critics at Cannes after his drama `Force Majeure` received a standing ovation following Sunday`s World premiere. Radio Sweden spoke to Swedish Radio`s film critic Roger Wilson, who is in Cannes.

Film critic Roger Wilson, from Swedish Radio's culture department, tells Radio Sweden that it is Ruben Östlund's most mature film so far.

"It was really hard to find someone who had anything negative to say about the film. Ruben Östlund's films are all about masculinity in crisis or what the modern man should be and this is no different. It feels like he is an established name now, people have got to know him and his themes and the way he tells his story. This film is his most mature film and also his most conventional film."

Pia Lundgren, Head of International Department at the Swedish Film Institute, tells Radio Sweden that the film's depiction of masculinity, and in particular, a scene where the leading man breaks down in tears, has been a hard watch for men  from some European countries.

Also on Sunday, the Swedish Film Institute, together with distributor Protagonist Pictures, arranged a showing of 'Searching for Sugar Man' in tribute to Malik Bendjelloul, who died last week.
