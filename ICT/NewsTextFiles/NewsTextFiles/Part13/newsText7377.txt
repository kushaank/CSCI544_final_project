
The Ladies Transport Service (LTS) which was launched three months before between twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad has been shut down due to lack of financial aid.

A special transport service was introduced on February, 17 to facilitate ladies commuters on Rawalpindi-Islamabad route. District management had made tall claims that the service would not be closed. But it has been suspended on becoming bankrupt. At the commencement of this service 12 vans were run and Rs 40,000 per bus owner was paid. Road hostesses were also appointed in the wagons which were being paid Rs 17000 per month on account of salary.

Sources said that the company had to suspend the service due to its failure in engaging some financer.
