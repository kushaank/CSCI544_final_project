
China Ambassador to Romania, Mrs. Huo Yuzhen said recently, quoted by Agerpres that the two countries can develop fruitful ties, pointing out that many Chinese businesspeople have various investment plans in Romania.

Ambassador Huo Yuzhen said she suggests all Chinese people to visit Romania and Targu-Jiu town, as she was impressed by the works of sculptor Constantin Brancusi located in Central Park.

"I am happy to be in your country, Targu Jiu is a very beautiful city. I have visited other 29 counties of Romania, this is my third time here, it is truly amazing, most likely because of the works of Brancusi. I learned about the works of Brancusi in Paris and I am very glad that I can see them with my own eyes. I believe that you are very rich culturally speaking and I think that fruitful relations can be established between the two countries. Many Chinese investors came to Romania with various investment plans.

China Prime Minister signed many contracts when he paid a visit to Romania," Huo Yuzhen said.

Targu-Jiu Mayor Florin Carciumaru pointed out that the visiting ambassadors were pleasantly impressed after this visit. "I believe that the visit of the group of ambassadors is a moment of pride for Targu-Jiu and a reason for joy, for we never had such a high-level diplomatic visit. It&prime;s an honour for us and I can say that after the sightseeing tour so far, our city will leave a pleasant and beautiful impression on the ambassadors," Florin Carciumaru said, quoted by Agerpres.
