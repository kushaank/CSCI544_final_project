
OKLAHOMA CITY - Local health officials have been tracking Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)  for the last two years  because they've always known the threat is just a plane ride away.

And a severe progression of MERS can happen quickly says Oklahoma State of Department Health Epidemiologist Dr. Kristy Bradley.

"It's predominantly a respiratory illness it starts with fever, body aches much like influenza and can progress with difficulty breathing, shortness of breath and pneumonia and some persons will also go into kidney failure," says Dr. Bradley.

Dr. Bradley has been working with the CDC since 2012 to track MERS which originated in Saudi Arabia.

The source of the virus is still unknown.

So far the CDC says there are two confirmed cases of MERS in Indiana and Florida.

Both patients had just recently traveled to Saudi Arabia.

And there's been one transmission of the virus in Illinois.

"What we know right know is 30 percent who contract and get diagnosed with MERS have died from it," says Epidemiologist Cynthia Harry with the Oklahoma City-County Health Department.

Harry says it's been awhile since we've had a scare of Anthrax or SARS but hospitals would treat patients in a similar manner.

"We would of course have them seek attention for their symptoms and also work with them for contact investigation," says Harry.

We also checked in with OU Medical Center and Mercy Hospital who tell us they will follow CDC guidelines which include isolating a patient if MERS is detected, as well protect any health care workers who come in contact with the patient.

"Monitor their health very closely for the two weeks after they return from that country," says Dr. Bradley.
