
After making plans to retire its Boeing 747 fleet and to upgrade its existing routes to Los Angeles and San Francisco using the Boeing 777, PAL is now focused on optimising its routes to Guam and Honolulu .

Beginning in August, Philippine Airlines will begin gradually increasing its Honolulu flights to daily service. The airline is currently operating the Manila-Honolulu route three times per week. On August 1, PAL will increase the frequency up to five weekly flights between the two cities. On October 26, the plan is to begin daily service. All Honolulu bound flights are operated by the 254-seat Airbus A340-300 aircraft. Flight 100 departs Manila at 5:30pm and arrives in Honolulu at 9:55am. The return flight, PR101, departs Honolulu at 11:40am and arrives back in Manila at 4:25pm.

Philippine Airlines will also be increasing flights on the Manila-Guam route beginning on October 26. PAL is currently operating five flights weekly. The plan is to add flights on Tuesdays and Thursdays, which will increase service on the route up to daily flights. All flights to Guam are operated by the Airbus A320 aircraft.

Meanwhile, Philippine Airlines is also making adjustments to its Bangkok flight schedule. After reducing the number of flights from 21 to 14 weekly flights due to political unrest in the Thailand capital, Philippine Airlines intends to restore some frequencies providing 17 weekly flights beginning on October 27. One daily flight will be operated by the Airbus A321 aircraft, while the second daily flight will be operated by the carrier's new Airbus A330-300 HGW aircraft featuring the new Business Class. The additional three weekly flights to be added in October will be operated by an Airbus A320 aircraft. This will later be upgraded to an A321 aircraft beginning in December.
