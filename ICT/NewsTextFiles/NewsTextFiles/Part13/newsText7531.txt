DOHA: Qatar Foundation for Education recently partnered with Best Buddies Qatar to host a fun-filled event for children with special needs.

The Buddy Carnival took place at Qatar Foundation Recreation Centre, and brought together 125 children and 72 buddies to participate in interactive and enjoyable activities.

Children enjoyed action-packed activities, including, face painting, henna tattooing, and cupcake decorating. They also took pictures with their favourite mascots and were entertained by delightful and lively acts, including a magic and puppet show, balloon twisting and the screening of the movie Frozen.

Designed to develop social skills of children, the event reinforced the commitment of QF and Best Buddies Qatar to create opportunities for children with special needs and help them further develop social skills with others in the same age group in a fun environment. Along with encouraging lasting friendships, initiatives also help increase self-esteem and confidence of children from both groups.
