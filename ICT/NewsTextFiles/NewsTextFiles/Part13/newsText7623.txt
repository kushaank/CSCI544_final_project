
Russia should withdraw from future Eurovision song contests and stage its own "straight" equivalent, according to Russian MPs.

Valerii Rishkin, a member of the Communist Party, condemned this year’s Austrian winner, the bearded drag queen Conchita Wurst, as the “last straw,” Interfax reported.

Rishkin said Russia should instead host a talent competition entitled the “Voice of Eurasia” in the future. “The results of the latest Eurovision were the last straw,” he lamented, describing Wurst as an "insult to most of the Russian population, and any other country."

“We must leave this contest immediately; it is high time that we stop tolerating this madness. Each year Russia spends 40 million euros on this,” he moaned.

Wurst, whose real name is Tom Neuwirth, was branded a “pervert” by Russian politician Vitaly Milonov after she sang her way to victory with the song “Rise Like a Phoenix” at the event.

And she has been accused by homophobic Russian protesters of creating a “hotbed of sodomy” at the 59th Eurovision song contest.
