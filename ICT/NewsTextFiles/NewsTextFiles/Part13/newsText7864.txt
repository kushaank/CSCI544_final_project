
A public affairs analyst, Emmanuel Mok, on Monday blamed the free movement of arms and ammunition used by Boko Haram insurgents in Nigeria on the removal of road blocks from Nigeria’s high and express ways by the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Abubakar.

“The IG’s policy of no road block; I believe that policy is helping boko haram” because “when they say these arms are coming in from Niger, Chad and Cameroon and from all of these places, I do not believe so” adding that Nigeria is the only “country that has the effective infrastructure to move arms at the scale that Boko Haram is releasing arms”, he said.

“You hear that Boko Haram have weapons and you can have containers that will house that; to drive from Lagos Port down to Borno, no check point anywhere”.

He advocated for the return of road blocks on “strategic roads in the country” insisting that “you need to check vehicles”.

Mr Mok further expressed optimism that neighbouring countries like Niger, Chad and Cameroon have “some kind of security measures in place” and hoped that “they will step it up more to what Nigeria has”.

He also commended the Cameroonian government for declaring war on Boko Haram.

He said despite the decision reached at the Africa Security Summit to deploy troops to rescue the abducted girls from Chibok, Borno State, “it will take some effective planning to make sure that when your troops are out there, they are properly protected and provided for” adding that “I expect that in not more than a week all that should be done”.

He warned that with the presence of international experts in the country to help fight the terrorists, Boko Haram cannot face that, so they will slow down their major activities and disperse themselves within the population.
