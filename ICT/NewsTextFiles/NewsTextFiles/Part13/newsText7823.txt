
The opposition parties will continue to consider potential candidates to run against Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the most probable contender from the ruling party, in the upcoming presidential election.

Main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) head Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu will meet his lawmakers in a closed session on May 21 and ask them to submit three names for consideration. Kılıçdaroğlu will also consult with his group about a potential alliance with the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) in the election.

MHP leader Devlet Bahçeli has also said a common candidate to stand against Erdoğan could be appointed, describing the “upcoming election one of the most important for Turkey’s future.” Kılıçdaroğlu left the door open to Bahçeli’s proposal on the condition that the proposed individual is also acceptable to the CHP.

Meanwhile, Bahçeli will continue his consultations for the presidential election on May 21 in a meeting with President Abdullah Gül. Bahçeli recently met former President Süleyman Demirel and is also set to consult with the CHP, the Great Union Party (BBP) and the Felicity Party (Saadet).

The deadline for submitting names to the Supreme Election Board (YSK) is July 3 and the first round of elections will take place on Aug. 10.
