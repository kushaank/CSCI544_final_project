
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court (SC) has directed the Capital Development Authority’s (CDA) former deputy director to appear before it in-person tomorrow (Wednesday).

Ejaz Chaudhry remarked, “The CDA officials have struck deal in the illegal allotment and distribution of plots. Were the CDA officials blind that they had not checked their record while giving the allotment letter? They want the SC seal affixed on their illegal job to get declared as fair.” He gave these remarks during the course of hearing of petitions filed by Ghulam Rasul and Wallayat Khan on Monday.

Advocate Zulfiqar Bhutta appeared on behalf of the petitioners who told the court that the CDA took away land property from Ghulam Rasul and Wallayat Khan, and allotted agro farm No 36-B to them. Later, they cancelled it on November 11, 2010. These persons had not furnished the documents related to the ownership rights of the land to the CDA. Rasool had handed over his 79 kanal and 16 marla land to the CDA while Wallayat Hussain had handed over 22 kanal and eight marla land to the CDA. It was said at that time that either the property in place of it would be provided to them in Sahiwal, or agro farm would be provided in Islamabad.

The court questioned “What is the CDA policy in this regard? First of all plot was allotted without looking into the matter. As to why it has been cancelled now.

The counsel for CDA demanded for time to answer the court. The court remarked “The officer who has done this job be produced in the court. The hearing of the case has been adjourned till tomorrow (Wednesday).
