
Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) MPA in the Sindh Assembly, Irfanullah Marwat, has given an eight-day ultimatum to the party to address his reservations.

“The federal government is not paying heed to us,” complained Marwat while talking to media on Monday. The PML-N lawmaker threatened to sit on independent benches if the party did not address his reservations. He moaned that an important meeting was held in Karachi with invitations being sent to Jamaat-e-Islami and Awami National Party, “But we were not even invited. Can’t we give suggestions to improve Karachi law and order,” asked Marwat.

“We had won elections on our own and kept PML-N alive in Sindh,” he said.
