
A woman mauled by a sow brown bear with two cubs while running late Sunday morning on an unpaved road on Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson barely remembers the details of the attack.

The woman, who asked military officials not to identify her, remained at Alaska Native Medical Center in stable condition on Monday, a base spokeswoman said.

Bleeding from slashes on her head and arms, she nonetheless managed to walk a mile or more uphill back to the Davis Highway, where her pickup was parked, according to Mark Sledge, senior conservation officer on the base. A passing driver, a soldier, picked her up and brought her to the base hospital.

The incident occurred near Fossil Creek and Pole Line Road, just west of the Anchorage Regional Landfill, around 11:30 a.m. That section of Pole Line Road heads into the former Fort Richardson backcountry, across hilly, forested terrain behind the municipal landfill and toward the Powder Ridge development in Eagle River.
