
MILITANT groups held a protest rally in front of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) general headquarters in Quezon City calling for the release Andrea Rosal, a daughter of the late New People's Army (NPA) spokesperson Gregorio "Ka Roger" Rosal.

Cristina Palabay, secretary general of Karapatan, said the AFP should allow Rosal to be released from detention to attend the burial of her two-day-old daughter, Diona Andrea, in Batangas City.

Diona Andrea died last Saturday due to hypoxemia or the lack of oxygen in the blood.

Karapatan said the AFP should be the one to blame for Diona Andrea's death since it denied Rosal from having proper medical attention when she was under military custody at the Camp Bagong Diwa in Taguig City.

Rosal, a top Communist Party of the Philippines-NPA leader in Southern Tagalog Region, was arrested by the members of the AFP and the National Bureau of Investigation on March 27 for allegedly being responsible for the abduction and the killing of a soldier and a man in Laguna in 2007.

Rosal was already on the last trimester of her pregnancy when she was arrested. The AFP claimed it took care of Rosal while in detention.
