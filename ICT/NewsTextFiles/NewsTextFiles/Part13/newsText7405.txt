
Corrine Matlak, of Jamesport, has received the Gordon McEwan Endowed Award in Archaeology from Wagner College. The McEwan Award is a grant awarded to students whose studies will include an experiential learning component in the field of archaeology; it is meant to help defray the costs associated with field work.

Matlak, who was recently inducted into the Wagner College circle of the Omicron Delta Kappa national leadership honor society, will travel this summer to the north coast of Peru to take part in the Wagner College-Moche Inc. Bioarchaeology Field School. She will spend five weeks analyzing human skeletal remains excavated from the archaeological site of Cerro Oreja and exploring other archaeological sites and local museums.

To help offset the costs of travel donations can be made on her fundraising page.
