
Amid a strong speculation that Prime Minister in-waiting Narendra Modi might want to create an independent ministry on internal security, Union Home Secretary Anil Goswami on Monday briefed him on the current national security situation.

Mr. Goswami held a half-an-hour meeting with Mr. Modi, during which he apprised him of the situation on the ground vis-à-vis insurgency and terrorism.

According to MHA sources, the Home Secretary briefed Mr. Modi on internal security dynamics in the nine Maoist-hit States, Jammu and Kashmir and the North-East. Mr. Goswami is also learnt to have given a presentation on counter-terrorism/insurgency initiatives -- both the military and the policy driven measures -- taken under the erstwhile Central government.

Apart from the impending challenges in peace keeping and conflict resolution, issues surrounding Andhra Pradesh bifurcation were also discussed.

The Home Ministry, on instructions from the Cabinet Secretary, has already prepared a report for the next government as part of the process for a smooth transfer of power, highlighting its achievements over the past few years and issues that require immediate attention.

As the Bharatiya Janata Party has always accused the UPA of compromising on internal security, officials expect that priority would be given to this department. “The next government may adopt a muscular and hawkish approach to internal security at all levels: from modernisation of intelligence apparatus and intelligence-driven action against insurgent/terror groups to espousing a more rigid stand towards cross-border threats. Many are of the view that the government may also decide to carve a separate internal security ministry from the existing Home Ministry setup,” said a senior official.
