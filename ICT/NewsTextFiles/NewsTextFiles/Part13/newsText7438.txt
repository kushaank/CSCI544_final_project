MANILA, Philippines - A vendor was killed and six others were seriously injured after a passenger jeepney allegedly driven by a man under the influence of liquor collided with a Philippine National Railways train Monday afternoon in Sampaloc, Manila.

Ronald Valdez, the 39-year-old driver of the jeep who was one of the injured in the collision, was found by doctors to be under the influence, said Senior Police Office 2 Edgar Adbuya from the investigation section of the Police Station 4 of the Manila Police District.

Witnesses said the iron bar that would have prevented vehicles from crossing the tracks failed to come down on time, a possible reason for the jeep to continue to cross the track.

“The train was already blowing its horn but Valdez tried to beat the coming train at the crossing. Nasalpuk siya ng train at nakaladkad pa ang jeep hanggang 200 metro (The jeep was rammed by the train and dragged for 200 meters)” before coming to a stop, Adbuya said.

Valdez is now in custody facing charges of homicide, multiple physical injuries and damage to properties.

The vendor, identified as 56-year-old Reynaldo Macapagal, was declared dead on arrival at the Ospital ng Sampaloc. He lost his left leg and sustained a fatal wound in the head.

Based in the investigation, the incident happened at around 4:20 p.m. in the vicinity of G. Tuazon Street, Balic-Balic.
