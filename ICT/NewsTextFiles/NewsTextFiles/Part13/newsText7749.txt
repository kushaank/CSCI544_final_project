
PARAMARIBO--Local news website Starnieuws.com shocked readers on Sunday, with a picture of a young child’s foot out of which a large chunk was bitten, supposedly by piranhas while the child was enjoying a family outing at a riverside resort.

A popular nature resort, Overbridge is located in District Para, an hour’s drive from Paramaribo. The children were playing within the shallow beachside that is closed-off with nets to keep dangerous animals out. Rambhadjan said when his daughter started screaming, a French tourist picked her up and carried her out of the water; blood was streaming from the eight year-old girl’s foot where a chunk had been bitten out.

Medical personnel at the Academic Hospital in Paramaribo confirmed that it was a piranha bite. Rambhadjan ended his vacation and left for the Netherlands, where his daughter got further medical treatment and both children got specialised help to handle the trauma.

He said he has also been in contact with the management of Overbridge, who have refused to accept responsibility. Para District Commissioner Jerry Miranda has said that his office has launched an investigation into the incident, while Overbridge management had its nets checked for possible tears where the ferocious fish could have entered through.
