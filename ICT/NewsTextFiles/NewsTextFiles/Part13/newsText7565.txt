
Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are visiting Paris in advance of their upcoming nuptials, and their presence is causing a Kimye commotion in the City of Lights.

As  People magazine reports , the couple attracted a large crowd of onlookers today when they did a little pre-wedding shopping in an upscale retail district.

"The pair stopped by Balenciaga and Colette, on Rue Saint-Honoré, before grabbing a quick lunch bite and heading over to Avenue Montaigne," says People, "where they shopped at Yves Saint Laurent, Versace and Celine. The duo then went to Montaigne Market, which also features luxury goods."

Meanwhile, even though the wedding isn't until May 24,  fans have already begun flocking to Forte di Belvedere in Florence, Italy, where the couple will exchange vows.
