
WCQS will soon air WUNC’s “The State of Things” on a regular basis, thanks to an ongoing partnership between WCQS and WUNC, headquartered in Chapel Hill. Starting June 2, the popular WUNC public affairs show hosted by Frank Stasio can be heard live on WCQS each weekday from noon to 1 p.m.

"WCQS has a strong history of service in Western North Carolina,” said Stasio, the former NPR correspondent who was named permanent host of “The State of Things” in 2006. “I am happy to be working with an organization that shares our values, which include a commitment to public service and quality journalism.

The weekday addition to the WCQS programming schedule follows a successful collaboration between WCQS and “The State of Things” for two live broadcasts of the program during the 2014 Moogfest in Asheville. WCQS and WUNC also plan to grow the partnership surrounding the broadcast of “The State of Things,” eventually including live reports from Western North Carolina as well as the voices and stories of people who live and work in the region.

“Listeners across Western North Carolina are passionate about this region and this state,” WCQS Program Director Barbara Sayer said. “And we are all acutely aware that what our legislators do in Raleigh affects everyone in the state.

Stasio said “The State of Things” plans to continue to engage its audience in active dialogue upon joining the WCQS broadcast schedule, inviting listener participation through calls, emails and social media.

"I really hope we'll be hearing from WCQS listeners,” he said. “We want ideas and suggestions for stories we should be covering and people we should meet."

Tune in for "The State of Things" airing weekdays from noon to 1 p.m. beginning June 2nd.
