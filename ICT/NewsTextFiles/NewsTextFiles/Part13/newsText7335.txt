
The night before the election results came and India took a sharp turn to the extreme right, I found myself in the midst of a lovely if similarly helplessness-inducing discussion in Delhi about progressive writers. Passionate writer and Urdu archivist Rakhshanda Jalil had planned the event weeks ahead and may not have known about the ironical timing of releasing her brilliantly researched book â€” Liking Progress, Loving Changes: A Literary History of Progressive Writersâ€™ Movement (PWM) in Urdu.

As the evening closed with a chorus of communist activists crooning Makhdoom Mohiuddinâ€™s battle-cry for revolution â€” Ye jang hai jang azadi, azadi ke parcham ke taley â€” you could be forgiven for thinking you were watching a Samuel Beckett play replete with absurdity and anachronism. The exit polls had indicated an extremely disturbing shift in Indian politics, and here some of the best speakers on Urdu were riveted to a slice of amazing history that progressive literature spawned. My mind, however, had strayed elsewhere.

It took Rahul a decade to realise that BJP represented a challenge to secularism.

Fifty years before Australian Christian missionary Graham Staines and his two sons, of six and 10 years, were burnt alive by a Hindutva mob in Orissa in January 1999, a Hindi movie based on a Bengali novel had anticipated the script. Swayamsiddha was the story of a Hindu bride of a mute husband.

There was a time, it seems, when I could recite the Ramcharitmanas fluently. Hinduism was Hinduism, not Hindutva then. Why else would Mrs Puri, the tallest and the burliest among the neighbourhood â€˜auntiesâ€™, leave me alone with the burden to carry on with the â€˜akhand jaapâ€™, the unbroken chant of Ramcharitmanas, all by myself? It didnâ€™t matter where all the devout women of our Nirala Nagar residential cluster in Lucknow disappeared after starting off ambitiously with the unbroken reading of Tulsidasâ€™ epic poem, which describes the trials and tribulations of Lord Ram.

High on his partyâ€™s unexpected victory in 2004, Congress scion Rahul Gandhi had mocked the Bharatiya Janata Party. â€œThe BJP is a joke. They have always abused my family,â€� he had said. This was barely two years after the Gujarat pogroms, mind you. It took the young leader a full decade to understand, but only after he faced a rout, that the BJP represented a challenge to Nehruvian secularism. Progressive writers on their part were never blind to the communal question though they may have failed to detect other social fault lines.

Dalit temples, for example, were mostly allowed to be built outside the city perimeters. As Lucknow expanded and Nirala Nagar flourished in its ambit, we found ourselves living near Raidas Mandir, built by devotees of the Dalit cobbler-sage Ravidas. It took years for me to see how caste Hindus, some of whom I joined to walk to the Hanuman Mandir a few miles down the road, would never bow their heads at the Raidas Mandir.

My fear is that our progressive peers unwittingly shunned potential allies and allowed them to be swamped by an entire phenomenon of rightwing culture and the unobtrusively appealing communal street literature that got harnessed into a movement, one which came into its own last week to sideline them ever more.

The writer's lament is not for the country, or its people, but for his lost political ideology, and for the loss of power by left-wing so called Rahul's who have nothing to offer but inane statements. Rahul kept repeating "women empowerment" when asked about any question - such as how will you get growth going in the economy? "The parrot could only repeat "women empowerment".

The write Jawed Naqvi needs to grow a lot.  He is mentioned "Nehruvian secularism"... the ideology of secularism found by our father of nation Gandhi. The only thing Nehru interested or fend off was womanizing. The Nehru happens to be Prime minister for the first time due to Gandhi backup. Otherwise, there was lot of other great leaders were there in the wings like Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Lal Bahadur Shastri (remind as PM for short period during Pakistan war) and many more. Please note, the word secularism is not a term or just a definition, it is something how coexistence can be done in a productive way instead of vote bank politics like Congress , Left, communist, BSP, SP & DMK is doing. If congress is secular, then why congress president Sonia needs to meet Delhi Imam and requesting the Delhi Imam the Muslim votes should not get split. If congress is following the so called secularism, then why need to have alliance with Muslim league party. In this election, instead of paper secularism the BJP proved ultimate secularism by reaching across caste , religion and won people heart to get such a land slight mandate to ensure the Congress needs to search for support to sit in opposition seat.

It is time you understand Mr Naqvi that Modi presents a progressive face to the nation. The days of securing votes by catering to religious vote banks is over. Today's youth wants peace N prosperity that Modi with his sharp economic acumen can give them.

Get well soon...... Keep bashing on hindus in neighbour and make more conspiracy theories. i started reading DAWN to know about my neighbour country. But since one month of reading such articles, i am convinced that people are misslead here by wrong propogandas by even constitutional badies forget about media. Its serious problem. People should protest for RTI in pakistan and should also remain in touch of foreign media. Seeing everything in world by islamic eyes will have dangerous consequances.

Dear Naqvi Sahib,

I cannot say that I agree with your views; indeed, I disagree with them most of the time. Again, I don't know why I felt compelled to write to you this time.

First, please let me assure you that the Indian ethos of pluralism is not dead. Yes, there is a great deal of bias among most Hindus regarding Muslims, but that does not translate to barbarism in day-to-day transactions.

Second, I consider myself a staunch Hindu. I am a devotee of a guru who was from the lineage of Radha-Krishna bhakti, or Braj Ras. In all my years with him, I have never come across him differentiating between Hindu, Muslims, Christians....not a word denigrating any other religion or sect. He has always said we are all a part of the same God. So, while my belief remains strong to my lineage, to Lord RadhaKrishna, I would fight anyone trampling on the rights of people of other religions. In that sense, I am like Nehru who personally defended the  lives of Muslims during Partition.

Third, though I am from Odisha, which has little connection to it, I am a great admirer of the Ganga-Jamuni tehzib,of which you and your brother Saeed Naqvi Sahib are particularly representative, . I love qawwalis, the beautiful Urdu language, and it never fails to amaze me when I see Hindus and Muslims co-exist in many strange and wonderful ways.

Rest assured, Naqvi Sahib, the spirit of India is not dead. If it is, it is not from Hindutva, but from the crass materialization that we see around us. And we voted for Modi not because he allegedly allowed the killings of 800 or so Muslims but because we desperately wanted to kick out the despicable Nehru family, because we wanted growth and a strong India.

Thanks,

Did it ever happened that an Indian took refuge in Iran, Palestine, Iraq, Ethiopia because religious or other persecution?  Answer is obvious, Never!  But all those nationalities took refuge in India because of religious persecution.  That is why India has more Zoroastrians than Iran and has Jews from Palestine and Iraq.  Can the esteemed author tell the reason?  Answer is religion is a foreign concept.  It is a later day Abrahamic cosntruct for imperialism.  "Later day" because it was created by Romans in 4th century to divide and mis-rule (exploit) native Jewish population.  They used converted Jews for subjugating their own cousins and spreading hate for native Jews.  Look what happened?  Jews were almost destroyed.  In recent past they created a nation state for their own protection.  Hope similar fate is not awaiting for native dharmik people of India.  But it seems with Modi's arrival it is going to be harder for "later day" Abrhamics to destroy Indian civilization the way did to native Jews, American Indians, Africans and Philippinoes.

The writer lacks serious political insight.

I have visited many temples presided by so called Dalits on whom the left wings fawn. Dalits are hindus and there is no division between hindus. I am equally comfortable with a Dalit or a Brahmin priest.

The writer lives in the past of make believe world of Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb- as the urdu origins suggest a nonsense coined by remanants of muslim nawabism to indulge and insult hindus.

India of 2014 does not need people who bring out stories from far flung corners on division of hindu samaj. You all are no longer the torch bearers of secularism. The youth of India is.

''I don't think anybody in Pakistan can be secular, otherwise he would be violating the constitution of Pakistan, which is beholden to uphold Islam. And the very first article of the constitution, article 2a, talks about the sovereignty of Allah, which makes it a very distinct country, a very distinct nation, in the community of nations. It is very important to understand because anybody who can say that I am secular actually is violating the constitution of Pakistan.'' Hamid Gul on Secularism.

you have no sense of reality my friend. hope you get well.

Mr Naqvi, fear is result lot of apprehensions in your mind which in turn are result of old biases & mindset. I can only advise you dont live in fear- comeback to pakistan - let some young journalist with forward looking ethos be stationed in India. WHen the world is trying to learn from India why should our neighboring countrymen be deprived positive vibes!

I will just repeat, When Hindus vote collectively it is a polarization and when Muslims vote together it is a consolidation.

"Don't bother me with your facts; I can get along perfectly with my prejudices", would summarize  the contents of three-quarters of the comments on Naqvi Sahib's articles.

Naqvi Sahib, please continue writing for the others.

Is there any justification for the title, given the content of the article ? What do you want to tell ? Congress has become a threat to the people of India. It sound extreme but see how India, once cruising at 8+% of growth rate and providing opportunities to its citizens, lost the growth rate. Consequently, it became tough for an ordinary Indian to ensure a decent living.

Mr. Naqvi, you say that even if 1.2 billions live in poverty, "Nehruvian Secularism" should survive, right ? Indians gave a loud and clear answer to people like you. They told what they want. Indians want employment, better life and a chance to improve, not ideologies. You'll never get the message.

Don't worry Naqvi saab.  Modi will not deny you a visa.  You will still be free to pedal your poison.

Not sure what you are talking here. Picking an incident here and another there and connecting them and trying to infer something that does not make sense.

Naqvi, simply respect the verdict of this many million people and enough of your continuous garbage, I am sure this resounding victory is not the votes of Hindu fascists or communal elements. People wanted a change, as they were fed up with the 10 years of misrule and the ruling UPA was hammered. Modi and his govt will meet the same fate, if they cannot deliver the promises and things did not improve and that's the beauty of democracy (though we don't have a perfect one). so take a chill pill and lets hope that we see a better government.

Indians (including Muslims) have selected their leader - like it or not, we don't care.

Mr. Naqvi - you have a predetermined biased mindset and you modify all events that show India in good light in your columns to prove that - you try to take every positive step in India in a negative manner.

@Alex You chose the wrong author who is India based but never found any thing positive about this incredible land so far and never will. As it said 'Never waste your time trying to reform those who are committed to negative thinking'.

Wow..I never thought even journalists can suffer from conspiracy theories.

I disagree with author's opinion but one of his statement I find particularly misguided that Hindus did not bow to the Dalit temple. I am a Hindu, a brahmin; temples and gurdwaras are our sacred to us but I also bow to whatever other places of worship pass and cross by. My family taught me to respect all. My Muslim friends smile when my eyes close in respect for a mosque but I tell them that where people worship, prayers and holy thoughts prevail is naturally a place to respect. I can point you to Hindu temples where idols/ pictures of other religions are also placed very respectfully. By the way, India matters to almost all Hindus world over,  just as Saudi Arabia to Muslims, and not only because of the religious and spiritual connection, but also its their ancestral place, provides ethnic identity, they can call it as their homeland and definitely wish it to be their final destination.

Jawed: while I too would lament the demise of secularism, I do not think it is the kind of secularism Nehru (or you and I)  would have recognized today. It had putrified over a period of time because of vote bank politics engendered by his daughter and her progeny. Secularism did not work when the Sikhs were under attack for example. I would say "Good Riddance" hence to the "secularism" if it means an end to dynasty even though I recall Indira Gandhi's triumphant return to the throne in the wake of the alternative government and its squabble.  What I am more concerned about and the irate Indian commentators here have forgotten/ignored in their emotional euphoria, is the hope that the tiger would actually lose its stripes. I am dubious. At the same time, as a believer in the democratic process, I would give the new Government time -  to try out "Chicago School" economics coupled with crony capitalism and FDI all of which would be eager for their pound of flesh. The good news is that the voters are willing to trounce the king if the venture does not pan out, methinks.

It is good to see some questions be asked of the esteemed progressive writers, they have succeeded in patting themselves on their backs to oblivion without ever attempting to assess their real impact on society. In a country with such ridiculous levels of poverty with wars against harsh capitalism are being waged by the poorest where is the rage in vernacular literature or poetry. Where are the folk songs that despair against the rising religious intolerance ? Where is the Kabir of our times ? You mention urdu poets but their reach is limited, atleast their works can be translated to the 18 official languages that the country has and similarly other revolutionary literature say from telugu could be translated to urdu. It is the duty of conscientious writers and poets to make the society aspire for egalitarianism , the progressive writers have much to answer.

@Sharad , Actually, when Muslims vote collectively it is to save secularism, but when Hindus vote collectively it is communal. The leftist logic.

People should cling "very strongly" to LIFE  People should cling "weakly" to BELIEFS If Beliefs fail to deliver Results / Performance (due to changing circumstances) Then Dump those BELIEFS Adopt New BELIEFS / Approaches to your Problems Life is more important than Beliefs Rigidity of Human Thought spells utter ruin in today's globalised world.

This Election demostrates that People are more amenable to CHANGE than their leaders ! To be a leader & to remain a leader , you have to be "AHEAD" of the People in the learning curve.

Dear Mr. Naqvi:  Real secularism is alive and kicking in India. Pseudo secularism - the kind pedalled by Congress should be dead and is perhaps dead. Vote banks of Muslims, Dalits or any other community is not secularism as I understand it. Vote banks use a communal separatist mentality of fear mongering among minorities, to make them vote en bloc. Their communal passions are stoked and in order to do so there is a need to create a monster to scare them. All this just to garner votes. Hindus and Muslims have flourished in India since time immemorial. The advent of Modi is a pin drop in India's history. No prime minister can upset that. The fear mongering by Rahul Gandhi and his cohorts is nothing short of blasphemy - he cried that 20K muslims will die if Modi will be elected. Lets see if that happens. The congress party has lost its ideology it has become opportunistic and non-intellectual. It has lost contact with the common people. An Italian woman elected on a sympathy wave after the assassination of her husband does not understand India or Indians. She and her son failed Indians at large who reposed faith in her. She became corrupt and ruled by proxy to unleash an environment of state wide corruption. She was defeated through a backlash by the only cognizable opposition party.  The minorities began to marginalize the majority community. Democracy is a numbers game, it was only a matter of time before the congress was defeated. Let us not color this defeat as a loss of secularism, it is not - it is a loss of credibility and rampant corruption that has led to this. Indians were simply fed up with the shenanigans of the Congress and resoundingly defeated it.

Did Javed learn secularism in Pakistan? Because in Congresses India, secularism only means appeasement of Muslim community to garner votes of those wretched souls continuously kept in poverty and ignorance for 65-years.

According to the author, he wants sharia law . Only then he will be convinced that real secularism has arrived in India.

Dear Mr Jawed Naqvi,

Answer the above question in detail using Nehruvian securalism (whatever that means). India is still secular because of Hindus. If majority were Muslims ask yourself honestly would India be secular. Is Pakistan secular? Mind you, it is not a bad to be Islamic country. Don't demand to be secular when not in majority.

I am distressed that so many comments suggest that humanity has deserted us. Have we now become completely  incapable of associating with people without first looking at their religion? I was touched by the article.
