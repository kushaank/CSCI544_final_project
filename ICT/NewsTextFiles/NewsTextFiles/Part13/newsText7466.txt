
North Korea issue rare apology after building collapses killing 'hundreds'

NORTH Korean officials have issued a rare apology after a building collapsed and hundreds of people are feared dead.

The accident in Pyongyang was reported by the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) who did not release the death toll but said the incident was "serious" and had distressed leader Kim Jong-un.

The apartment block was thought to have housed 92 families and a report said the construction "was not done properly and officials supervised and controlled it in an irresponsible manner".

A typical North Korean family has four members, meaning the casualties could be well into the hundreds.

One official is reported as saying Mr Kim "sat up all night, feeling painful after being told about the accident".

Hundereds of people took to the streets in Pyongyang to express their grief and anger.

Pak Chol said: "This happened because they broke the rules and methods of construction."

Another resident, Hong Nam Hyok, said: "Everyone in Pyongyang is now sharing the sorrow of the victims and the bereaved families."

The accident happened last Tuesday but KCNA took five days to report it and did not give details of what had happened.

According to correspondents it is not uncommon for residents to move into partially completed apartment blocks in North Korea and before construction is complete.

The apology issued by officials is extremely rare in a state which rarely offers self-critique.
