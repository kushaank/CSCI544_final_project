The deceased has been identified as Sepoy Bhikale of 2 Maratha Light Infantry.

The injured jawans -- Head Constable Vinod Kumar and Lance Naik Amol Kumar -- have been admitted to the military hospital, Northern Command for treatment.

The militants had planted an IED near a track and triggered the blast to target the troops, the official said, adding that the matter is being investigated.

Pakistani troops later resorted to brief firing on the forward border belt in Nathu Tibba area, triggering panic among the villagers. The firing came to end on Sunday night, police officials said.

An attempt by three Pakistani militants to sneak into Indian territory was on Sunday foiled by the army, which also defused an IEDs planted by the infiltrators near a forward post in Bhimbher Gali belt of Rajouri district.

Troops guarding the borderline fired on the infiltrating terrorists and they fled to Pakistan occupied Kashmir, a defence spokesman said.

This was the third infiltration bid by Pakistan militants along LoC. On May 10, two militants were killed when Army troops foiled an infiltration bid along Line of Control in Kalsia belt of Poonch district.

One jawan had suffered injuries in the firing.

On May 3, troops foiled an infiltration bid along LoC in Sawjian belt of Poonch district.
