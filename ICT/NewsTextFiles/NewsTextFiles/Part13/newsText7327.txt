
Chennai :Â 11 members of Tamil Nadu's opposition DMK have been arrested in Chennai and booked for attempt to murder for an attack on journalists outside party leader MK Stalin's home.

Some journalists were injured when they were roughed up allegedly by DMK supporters when party leaders gathered at Mr Stalin's home to persuade him not to resign over the party's poll debacle. The journalists' cameras were smashed in the violence.

The DMK has regretted the violence and blamed "anti-social elements."

On Sunday, DMK leader TKS Elangovan said, "Some evil forces could have infiltrated the crowd and created confusion. However, as organisation secretary of DMK, I express my deep regret on the attack on journalists."

Mr Elangovan said the protesters targeted reporters over what they thought was criticism of Mr Stalin.

Mr Stalin, who fronted the DMK campaign for the national election, offered to resign from party posts but retracted after his father and party chief, M Karunanidhi, reportedly told him his leadership was essential.

He tweeted on the attack on journalists, saying, "My sympathy for press reporters facing unpleasant events from external elements who were present along with party workers and media outside my home (sic)."

The DMK didn't win a single seat in the national election, which saw the state's ruling AIADMK sweeping Tamil Nadu, winning 37 of 39 parliamentary seats.
