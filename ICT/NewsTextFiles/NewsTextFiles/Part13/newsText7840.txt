
Officials at Turkey’s Soma mine ignored dangerous build-ups of toxic gas in  the days prior to a fatal fire that claimed the lives of 301 miners last  week, investigators and miners have said.

The further evidence of dismal safety conditions at the pit, which employed  some 6,000 people in western Turkey’s Manisa province, comes after senior  officials at the company were detained, with five now charged with causing  death by negligence.

“In the months before the disaster, the methane sensors were almost always  red, but everyone ignored them,” Sefa Koken, 30, a safety technician at the  mine, told The Times.
