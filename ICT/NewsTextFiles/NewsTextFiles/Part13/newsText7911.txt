
As Memorial Day weekend approaches, Americans across the country will pack into their beloved SUVS and plug-in hybrids and drive off into the sunset on various summer adventures.

Typically the start of summer driving season doesn’t just fire up barbecues pulled out of storage, it usually gets gas prices going as well. One man who doesn’t see this trend continuing is crude oil watcher Jeff ‘Killer’ Kilburg of KKM Financial .

Killburg says the recent push higher in oil is all due to uncertainty in Ukraine. “It’s all about this scare, a possible supply interruption, that makes the whole energy space go up.” While AAA is forecasting prices are heading higher for gas at the pump, Kilburg isn’t buying it.
