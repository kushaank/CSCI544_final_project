
European Energy Commissioner GÃ¼nther Oettinger met Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak on Monday in Berlin to discuss issues relating to security of gas supply and transit from Russia via Ukraine to the EU. It was a constructive meeting that helped to prepare the ground for the second trilateral meeting between the EU, Russia and Ukraine, the European Commission said in a press release. This meeting is scheduled for 26 May subject to confirmation by all parties involved.

The aim of the trilateral meetings is to ensure continued gas supplies and transit. Concerns about the outstanding debt of Ukraine and the gas price for supplies to Ukraine are being discussed in the trilateral format in order to find a solution by the end of May. Some progress has already been made.

The amount of the unpaid bills for gas delivered by Russia to Ukraine is undisputed until the end of March. However, there is no breakthrough yet. An issue that still needs to be solved is the price for gas delivered in April and May and the price that should be applicable as from June.

Oettinger met Ukrainian Energy Minister Yuriy Prodan on 13 May and he will also be in contact with him in the next days ahead of the trilateral meeting, the Commission said.
