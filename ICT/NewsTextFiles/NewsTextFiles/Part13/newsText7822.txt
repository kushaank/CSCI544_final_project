
ANKARA,— The BDP 's deputy Co-President         responsible for Local Administration, Demir Çelik,         says the new mission of the party is to gain         legitimacy for the Democratic Autonomy project and         give it a broader perspective covering the whole of         Kurdistan. Çelik emphasised that this mission of the         BDP will be combined with the HDP in Turkey and has         the meaning of constructing a new period in which a         solution will be produced to the question of         democratisation and to a series of problems from         poverty to unemployment, from hunger to the question         of education in the mother tongue.

BDP MPs, from 28 April, joined the HDP and will now         continue their parliamentary activities within the         HDP group. The HDP, which has a strategic importance         as regards the questions of democratisation, first         and foremost the Kurdish question, will take on a         new dimension with its extraordinary congress on 22         June, which will be a milestone in the struggle for         fundamental rights and freedoms.

As for the BDP, at its congress on 8 June its         mission, in addition to its name and its emblem,         will take on a different dimension and as a Kurdish         party implement the project of Democratic Autonomy         within a stronger, more legitimate framework. We         asked the BDP 's deputy Co-President responsible for         Local Administration Demir Çelik about the BDP's         mission, the HDP's role and policy and the         Presidential elections.

The BDP has been an active political party since         its congress in 2010. The HDK, of which the party is         a component, also has the HDP, which has been active         for a year. The politics of these two parties are         parallel. Since the policies of these two components         of the umbrella (???) party are the same we decided         to give prominence to the HDP in Turkey and turn the         BDP into a party that concentrates on a more Kurdish         political identity in the region.

We wanted to have discussions after the elections.         We concentrated on how we would construct the         relationship between the HDP and BDP during our         evaluation of the election campaign. It was thus         decided that the HDP, which has a perspective of         appealing to all oppressed, impoverished working         people and those who have been discriminated         against, and to resolve the political, historical         and social problems that have accumulated, should be         presented to Turkey as a third option without delay.         The decision was therefore taken to hold a HDP         congress on 22 June. And we at the BDP preferred to         be involved in a single entity sand moved to the HDP.         The BDP will hold a congress on 8 June, at which it         is likely that the flag, emblem and name will be         changed. The new name will either be the Party of         Democratic Regions or Party of Democratic Peoples.         It will concentrate onwww.Ekurd.net Kurdistan-based politics. It will be a cadre party         aiming to establish a political accumulation through         academic ideological and philosophical education.         The party will be transformed from an election-based         organisation into one that organises the ideological         and philosophical aspect of society. The HDP will         then, after the congress of 22 June, fill the vacuum         left by the BDP.

As a culmination of this idea as the DTK we declared         Democratic Autonomy on 14 July 2011. We knew the         state would not share sovereignty due to its nation         state/unitary state reflexes. We could not leave our         legitimate democratic rights to the mercy of the         dominant state. If we have a legitimate demand, we         must implement mechanisms to achieve and realise         this right. Since that time we have been         endeavouring to develop the ecological, economic,         legal and self-defence dimensions of Democratic         Autonomy in the region on the basis of civil         democracy, alongside of, and in spite of, the state.         We have made progress in the three years, but have         not created a proper social opposition. We will try         to build Democratic Autonomy through the BDP and DTK.         We will implement work to resolve problems such as         unemployment, poverty and hunger. At the same time         we want to create a Kurdistan that can break down         the perception of a Kurdistan emptied of people and         impoverished and rendered needy by an authoritarian         state, replacing it with an entity that can stand on         its own feet with its own economy.

How much longer should we wait for things from the         state? They say education in the mother tongue is         forbidden, that education cannot be in languages         other than Turkish. If we just accept this and raise         no objections this will not happen for another 50         years. We therefore have to organise a struggle that         will force the state to agree to our own project.         Since we are in power in local government and are         going to run our own affairs what are the dynamics?         There are the Kurds, the Armenians, the Syrians and         the Azeris. The social reality is multi-identity,         multi-cultural. The state does not provide         multi-lingual, multi-cultural services. We oppose         this policy. It is a matter of urgency that local         government provide support so that people can obtain         education in the mother tongue.

People receiving education in the mother tongue         should be taught the mother tongue in creches and         nursery schools. It is important to produce books         and train teachers and educators. Health has also         been turned into a marketable commodity by         capitalist modernity in the present day. The Kurds         suffer the most from this. First of all they have         been deprived of health services in the mother         tongue. As municipalities we aim to provide free,         accessible services in the mother tongue that meet         the political, social, psychological, biological and         cultural needs of the individual.

'The state will try to         break our will'

These projects I have mentioned will only meet 8% of         Turkey's energy needs. But these 700 hydroelectric         power installations will destroy the flora and fauna         of Kurdistan, the Black Sea region and the Taurus         mountains, driving the people to the big cities,         Istanbul, Izmir, Adana and Mersin. This will cause         psychological, political and cultural problems for         the people involved. This is why one of the         important dimensions of Democratic Autonomy is the         ecology dimension. We want to transform localities         into viable eco-cities that are opposed to nuclear         energy, fossil fuels and hydroelectric power         stations. The state will not do this. On the         contrary, it will drive us into the cities and         endeavour to break our will and shape us with its         constant ideological bombardment. It wants to         transform the population into an obedient,         shepherded society where no one raises a demand or a         protest. In this respect, Democratic Autonomy is not         a project for the Kurds and Kurdistan, but is         instead a project for the democratisation of Turkey.         We therefore do not see democratic autonomy as         limited to an ethnic identity or geographical         boundaries.

There is at present a move away from strict         centralised authoritarian government towards         autonomous government. Service to the individual         provided by the nearest unit, human-based service,         horizontal rather than vertical provision of service         and the rational use of resources and participatory         democracy is gathering momentum.

Turkey is far from being able to offer a response.         While Turkey is the 16th biggest economy in the         world, it is 92nd on the life index table! There is         wealth, but it belongs to 20% of the population. 80%         live in poverty. So this is the project of the         oppressed and impoverished. We use the term         democratic autonomy to express the status of         self-government of the peoples with their         identities, cultures and languages in 25 or 26         regional administrations rather than dealing with         external borders. We mention this status of having         Ankara as a centre with a joint constitution, under         which there will be a regional constitution granting         equal rights and authority over tourism, health,         education, culture and local security. External         diplomacy, finance and defence would remain with the         centre. Outside of that every region should be         autonomous and be able to govern itself.

First of all we have to rescue these people from         this paranoia. The unitary nation state has imposed         its "indivisibility of the people and indivisibility         of the motherland" on society. It has appropriated         the wealth of society to perpetuate itself. However,         the reality is that it has not brought justice and         peace to society. Our approach is to persuade the         people. There are numerous examples of autonomy,         where societies have progressed. Germany, Spain,         Italy, the UK, Russia, the USA. Perhaps there are         others. They devolved powers and responsibilities to         autonomous, federative, confederative structures,         both saving costs and taking maximum advantage of         the synergy of social dynamics in those regions.

Is denial and conflict with peoples and identities         the way to grow or a path of peaceful coexistence         and dialogue? As Turkey has not realised this it has         been in conflict with the Kurds for 40 years. This         has cost a trillion dollars and the lives of         soldiers, police and guerrillas. Society has         suffered political and social trauma. First of all         we have to convince people that there is not a         strategy for separation. Democratic autonomy is         democratisation for Turkey. The Kurds do not only         want this for themselves. It is appropriate for 36         ethnic identities in Turkey, for members of the         three large religions and for different faiths like         the , Alevis and Syriacs. What is the most important         need in a village? Let a village commune make that         decision rather than the civil or military         bureaucracy in Ankara. Let a provincial assembly to         which the village commune is affiliated, and a         regional assembly to which the provincial assembly         is affiliated have decision-making powers. This         relationship will allow speedy, maximum activity at         a low cost.

'It will spread in waves'

We are not starting off with zero on the clock. We         have made progress since 2011. We have books and         materials for educational use in creches and nursery         schools. We have been through the pain of the         assimilation process and instead of feeling sorry         for ourselves we have to create an alternative. We         have to open creches and schools which teach the         mother tongue. There are 101 municipalities which         have such facilities, as we want to be able to save         children from assimilation and ensure they exercise         their birthright. Without language there can be no         literature, art, identity or people. This is why the         unitary nation state denies them and subjects them         to assimilation and political integration. It is not         enough just to oppose this, we must create an         alternative. We cannot do everything at once, but         starting with the municipalities like a stone thrown         into a pool of water the waves will spread out.

In our municipal organisations we have support         houses for women and cultural premises. We have to         develop our educational capacity. Rather than wait         for it from the state we have to create a social         democratic organisation. We have just experienced         another 5 years of conflict between legitimacy and         the official authorities.

In face of history the legitimate is in the right.         Laws do not meet the needs of society. We are being         governed with the constitution of the fascist         dictatorship. We want to get rid of it but we can't.         Rather than wait we have to create organisation that         makes the state smaller and increases the legitimacy         of society. This is what the BDP is going to do, and         the DTK will implement its legislative activity as         an assembly in Kurdistan as today is the future. We         want to establish a mechanism for education, culture         and health in the mother tongue.

Like all organisations we have medium and long term         plans. We emphasise that this process has a dual         character. There is a situation of dual power, on         the one hand civil democratic organisation seeking         self-reliance, and, on the other the mentality of         state power. The two will clash. We will look to         develop the social opposition and reduce the size of         the state. But while doing this we will also look to         ensue that all our gains are safeguarded by the laws         and constitution of the state. We will endeavour         through the HDP in parliament to enact a law on         regional government that ensures the state does not         deny or usurp our gains.

We will at the same time wage a struggle for the         Democratic Autonomy of Kurdistan to be given         constitutional safeguards. Part of this is using the         Council of Europe's European Charter of Local         Self-Government to gain financial autonomy. While         doing this we will also try to expand the boundaries         of democratic autonomy by developing the human         aspect. This is an intertwined process. Kurdistan         will be one part of this, which we will carry on         with the BDP and DTK. The other part will be Turkey,         where we wish to live in democratic joint homeland         with the other peoples. We foresee a democratic         organisation of society, not one governed by the         state. The HDP and HDK will play a significant role         in this meeting with the peoples of Turkey.         Important developments may ensue in the next few         months or years.

It is evident that Turkey cannot be exempt from         global developments. It cannot ignore the synergy         developed by the Kurdish opposition. Globalisation         has created with new dynamics a world where the         state has shrunk and the needs of society have         grown. The state will look for a solution. The AKP's         policy for the last 12 years of making do, of         getting by and insistence on non-resolution, will         fail. As the Kemalist line of the CHP and the         nationalist line of the MHP do not present an         alternative, the third way will be that of the HDP         which shares the vision of sharing the future, as in         Rojava. It is obviously futile to expect a         resolution from the AKP and the Prime Minister, who         is persisting with an authoritarian unitary state         rationale. The only option is to take power away         from the hands of the elite and put it in the hands         of society.

With tenets of a democratic nation we want to arrive         at a democratic republic different from that imposed         by the unitary nation state. Regions should have         political autonomy. We should all have equal rights         as equal citizens of a democratic republic. We will         construct this in Kurdistan and endeavour to demonstrate what the transition to regional         government will provide for communities. Ten per         cent of the population is unemployed. Most of them         are young, university graduates, with energy,         looking for change. 25 million exist below the         poverty line. Our problem is this paradox which is         not expressed or dealt with. Cotton in Çukurova,         figs in the Aegean, hydroelectric projects in the         Black Sea region which are causing environmental         destruction. These are all our problems. Being in         parliament gives us the opportunity to present an         alternative solution.

'We will go to the people         with our alternative'

Rather than the AKP's agenda, I will discuss ours.         Naturally, the AKP, as the authoritarian, dominant         pro-unitary state party will consider its future. If         it can change the MIT law in one night, and the HSYK         law in one night to prevent him and his family being         touched, then he will feel he has the right to do         that. And he won't stop at that. He will be a king,         a sultan. There will be no separation of powers. He         will be the boss.

Much worse. It will lead to a social and political         crisis. We will remind people of this. We are         seriously concerned that a political crisis would         lead to bloodshed. We will talk about this during         the Presidential elections. It would mean to         recreate the 1930s of Hitler and Mussolini. The         people cannot be that blind. We will explain all         this with our candidate. We will demonstrate that         there is no alternative to our candidate, the         candidate of the oppressed, as neither Erdoğan's         authoritarianism, nor the CHP and MHP's pro-status         quo and militarism are an alternative. It may not         win us the Presidency, but it is important as         regards creating hope for the future. We will         approach it as a means to spur on the hope that         society is able to govern itself..
