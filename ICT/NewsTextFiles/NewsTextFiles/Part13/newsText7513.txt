Americans are more willing to accept a philandering presidential candidate who has never held elected office and admits to smoking pot than one who  is an atheists, according to a new poll released Monday.

The Pew Research Center poll looked at 16 factors that would impact a voter's perception and support of a presidential candidate.

Overall, voters said they favor candidates with military and business experience, or those who has held a governor's post. Twenty-one percent said they'd be more likely to support a candidate that was an evangelical Christian and 19 percent said they'd be more likely to support a female candidate, with almost the same number supporting a candidate in their 40s.

Voters didn't extend that same level of acceptance to some other issues, however.

Thirty-five percent said they'd be less likely to support a presidential candidate who had an extramarital affair and 22 percent said they wouldn't support a candidate that used marijuana. They reserved their harshest criticism for candidates who claimed to be an atheist.

Only 5 percent said they'd be more likely to support an atheist candidate compared to 53 percent who said they'd wouldn't, the highest negative rating in the survey. Seventy percent of Republicans and 42 percent of Democrats said they wouldn't support an atheist candidate.

The Pew survey questioned 1,501 adults nationwide from April 23 to 27.
