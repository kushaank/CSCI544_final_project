
The Foreign Minister of Abkhazia Vyacheslav Chirikba expressed his gratitude and respect for principles to the 80 Turkish journalists who arrived in Abkhazia despite the pressure on them from the Georgian Consulate in Ankara. He spoke to ApsnyPress of this today after the meeting at the MFA with the Turkish journalists.

The 44th General Session of the Council of the Federation of Journalists of Turkey and the First Abkhaz-Turkish Congress of Journalists will take place from May 9th to 12th.

Vyacheslav Chirikba said that the Directors of several Turkish media outlets were addressed with letters by the Georgian Consulate in Ankara discouraging journalists from visiting Abkhazia. Some were invited for a discussion where they were actively discouraged from visiting Abkhazia. However, several leading Turkish media outlets have decided to visit Abkhazia.

“Abkhazia´s biggest issue is that the republic is not very well-known in the world, including neighboring Turkey, where several thousand members of the Abkhaz Diaspora live. The journalistic “landing” of the Turkish media is a somewhat of a discovery of Abkhazia for the Turkish public,” said the Minister. He noted that the numerous meetings on various levels with Turkish representatives show the country´s sympathy towards Abkhazia.
