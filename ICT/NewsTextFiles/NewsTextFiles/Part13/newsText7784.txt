Guam - The date is set and preparations are underway as Chad DeSoto will go to trial on June 9th.

During his pre-trial conference this morning, Judge Anita Sukola noted the trial could run anywhere from six to eight weeks with direct and cross-examinations to take at least 32 hours.

"I do note the government had filed 138 potential witnesses and defense filed 30 potential witnesses," Her Honor announced.

Chief Deputy AG Phillip Tydingco says he's looking to cut their witness list significantly.

Guam Visitors Bureau acting PIO Tony Muna notes that GVB has been in conversations with the AG's Office to assist with the airfare and lodging of witnesses for the trial. The funding would come from the 2/12 Memorial Fund.

DeSoto is accused of driving a car down a sidewalk in Tumon in February 2013. He ran over several tourists in his path. He eventually got out of the car and began stabbing people. Three people died and eleven others were injured. He has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental illness, disease or defect. He has undergone two separate psychological evaluations, but the findings are not available to the public.
