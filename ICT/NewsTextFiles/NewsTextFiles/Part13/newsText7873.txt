
Jammu: A soldier was killed and two were injured in a guerrilla attack near the international border in Jammu and Kashmir Sunday, an official said Monday.

Two soldiers were injured Sunday in a landmine explosion in the Akhnoor area of the international border in the state. Sources said a patrol party had gone to evacuate the injured soldiers when it came under attack.

The patrol party was targeted by terrorists in Akhnoor area at 11 a.m. Sunday, Defence spokesman Col. Manish Mehta told IANS, adding Sepoy Bhikale was killed in this attack.

A high alert has been sounded in the area.

The army also foiled an infiltration bid on the Line of Control (LoC) in Bhimber Ghali area of the Poonch district Sunday when a group of guerrillas were prevented from sneaking into the Indian side.

An improvised explosive device (IED) left behind by the guerrillas was later destroyed.

Heightened tensions on the border between India and Pakistan have thrown the lives of thousands of civilians living close to the border out of gear.

A modicum of normalcy had returned after the signing of a bilateral ceasefire agreement in November 2003.

The agreement held well for some years, but last year frequent ceasefire violations by Pakistani troops both on the LoC and the international border in Jammu and Kashmir again heightened tensions between the two neighbours.

In 2014, the Pakistani Army has violated the ceasefire agreement seven times so far.
