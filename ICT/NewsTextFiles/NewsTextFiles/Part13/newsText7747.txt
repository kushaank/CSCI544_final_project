“We will not look the other way while innocent people go through unimaginable suffering. Britain is already leading the international response to this crisis and the extra support announced today will give hundreds of thousands of people the food, water and medicine they need to survive.

Since fighting broke out in South Sudan in December 2013 the situation has quickly escalated into one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. More than 1m people have been forced from their homes, 10,000 women and girls are at risk of rape and there is evidence of child soldiers being recruited.

Britain’s new £60 million package of support for South Sudan includes £16.5m to help the World Food Programme feed over 100,000 people and £5 million for the Red Cross to provide life-saving assistance and treat the war-wounded.
