
CEBU, Philippines - Two persons were gunned down by unidentified men in separate shooting incidents in Talisay City and in Alcoy town Sunday.

A 29-year-old man succumbed to two gunshot wounds in the back portion of his body after shot by an assailant during a benefit dance in Barangay Tapul, Talisay City. He was declared dead on arrival at the Talisay City District Hospital.

Joel Cabayles, with live-in partner and resident of Sitio Catican of the barangay, was at the benefit dance betting illegal gambling or "hantak" when the suspect arrived and, without a word, shot him twice past 2:30 a.m.

Police Officer 2 Edwin Campomanes, responding officer, said Cabayles had an argument with a person that morning at a cockfighting arena. Even if the argument was settled, police said the person whom Cabayles had an argument with will also be a subject of their investigation.
