"I was shocked, I was like, 'Aren't you supposed to give me the money?' They were like 'No' and asked if I had the three grand or not,” she told the New Zealand Herald.

Later, she found out her prize was merely to be eligible to travel to Turkey in June for the Miss Globe International pageant and had to pay her own way. When she called the chief executive of Face of Beauty International Ltd., Milagros Manuel, to let her know she couldn’t afford to enter, she was told to give up her crown.

"She said, 'Good, you don't have the money. Give the crown and sash back, I have other girls lined up'", Nath said.
