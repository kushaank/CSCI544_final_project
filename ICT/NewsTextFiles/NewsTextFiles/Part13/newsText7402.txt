
David Cameron has spoken passionately about his desire for Scotland to remain in the UK, insisting that “we would be deeply diminished without Scotland”. Now that sentiment is to take on a personal hue for the prime minister and his wife Samantha, who have hired a Scottish nanny to take care of their three children.

The helper has been hired to replace Gita Lima, the family’s long-serving Nepalese nanny, who will shortly go on maternity leave.

The new nanny, whose name is not known, was shown the ropes yesterday by Ms Lima, joining her on the children’s school run.
