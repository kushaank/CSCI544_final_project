
Reach Out to Asia (Rota), Qatar’s  leading non-profit organisation, has signed an agreement naming Qatar  Chemical and Petrochemical Marketing and Distribution Company (Muntajat)  as the official sponsor of Rota’s iEARN-Qatar programme for the next  three years.

With the signing of this sponsorship deal with  Rota, Muntajat kicks off its corporate social responsibility (CSR)  programme aimed at contributing to the development of society in Qatar  and abroad.

The agreement was signed yesterday by Mohamed  Jassim al-Naama, Rota acting director, and Abdulrahman Ali al-Abdulla,  CEO of Muntajat.

iEARN is a non-profit organisation made up of  over 30,000 schools and youth organisations in more than 130 countries,  empowering teachers and young people to work together using the Internet  and other new communications technologies. More than 2,000,000 students  each day are engaged in collaborative iEARN projects worldwide.

Rota, as the sole representative for iEARN in  Qatar since 2008, has been supporting iEARN’s objectives of improving  learning and teaching, and arousing civil awareness and responsibility.

About 450 teachers from 95 schools in Qatar  have benefited to date by attending Rota’s iEARN-Qatar workshops, and  have participated in a variety of iEARN projects with their students.

Since the beginning of 2014, Rota has partnered  with Qatar University’s National Centre for Educators Development to  co-implement the iEARN-Qatar programme.
