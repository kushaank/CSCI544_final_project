
US Vice President Joe Biden is expected to arrive on the divided island of Cyprus on Wednesday, where he will meet with Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades and other representatives of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities to discuss the progress of peace talks.

Another item that is expected to top the agenda of the meeting is the crisis in Ukraine and concerns in Cyprus that sanctions against Russia could have a negative impact on the islands economy, a conduit of Russian investment and savings.

We are aware and understanding of the exposure of Cyprus to Russian economic activity, a senior US official told Agence France-Presse on Monday.

Biden will be visiting Bucharest on Tuesday before traveling to Nicosia on Wednesday.

Biden will be the highest-ranking US official to visit the island since 1962.
