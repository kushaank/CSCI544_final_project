
Rangel is heading a joint list with the People's Party, with which the PSD has been in coalition at national level since after the general election of 2011.

Menezes, a former mayor of Vila Nova de Gaia and one-time leader of the PSD, joined Rangel's campaign in Valpa√ßos, to show, in his words, that the party is not divided in these elections.

"I'm 200% with Dr. Paulo Rangel, heart and soul, by conviction, because as I said at my party's congress, I believe he is a person who is above the party itself in terms of prestige these days," Menezes told journalists. "I'm convinced that Dr. Paulo Rangel will once more repeat the success he had five years ago."

Menezes also praised Nuno Melo, the People's Party top candidate, who is fourth on the joint list.

Polls of voter intentions have put the Socialist Party several percentage points ahead of the governing coalition.
