
At least 80 people comprising 23 households arrived back to South Sudan from across its northern border between Northern Bahr el Ghazal and Darfur.

The western part of South Sudan is less affected by violence than elsewhere, and inter-tribal peace conferences earlier this year between the Dinka Malual and neighboring Darfur tribes enabled the returnees to travel without obstacles.

They arrived to Aweil town passing through Majok Nyinthieu border point and were received by State Director of Relief and Rehabilitation Coordinator Deng Kuel Kuel and other state officials in Aweil town on Sunday.

Speaking to Radio Tamazuj, Deng Kuel Kuel said most of the returnees originated in Western Bahr el Ghazal, the neighboring state.

He said they will give the returnees one month of food rations. “We have recieved them for a short time and then they will be leaving to Wau soon,” he said.
