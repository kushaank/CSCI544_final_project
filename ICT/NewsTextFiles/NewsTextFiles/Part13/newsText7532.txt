
Qatar Executive will add another new ultra-long haul Bombardier Global 5000 Vision to its “modern fleet” in July in time to cater to the increased demand for private jet travel during the traditionally busy summer season.

The announcement one day prior to the opening of Europe’s leading business aviation show EBACE in Geneva, where Qatar Executive is exhibiting with a dedicated stand (booth number 415), follows the operator’s recent acquisition of a brand-new Bombardier Global Vision.

The new delivery will bring up Qatar Executive’ fleet size to a total of eight wholly-owned aircraft, comprising of four Global 5000s – among them two Global 5000 Visions – three Challenger 605s and one Global XRS.

“Built to please the most discerning customers”, Qatar Executive’s new Bombardier Global 5000 Vision with its ultra-long range, superior cabin comfort and cutting-edge technology is proving very popular.

With a flying speed of up to 950km per hour, and range of up to 9,260km, the aircraft is capable of flying virtually anywhere in the world to many intercontinental destinations non-stop from Doha and other points in the Middle East without having to stop for refuelling, ensuring a hassle-free and time-saving experience.
