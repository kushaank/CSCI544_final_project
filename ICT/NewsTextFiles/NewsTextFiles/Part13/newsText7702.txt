
Daniel Wani, a Sudanese man with U.S. citizenship, has returned to Sudan to try to save his wife’s life.

Meriam Ibrahim was sentenced to death because she is considered Muslim by Sudan’s courts, and her husband is Christian. Ibrahim is eight-months pregnant.

A court sentenced her to 100 lashings and death by hanging.

In Sudan, as in many Muslim nations, Muslim men can marry outside their faith, but Muslim women cannot. Ibrahim’s father was Muslim, but her mother was Christian. Her father left when she was young, and she grew up as a Christian.

Wani and his brother Gabriel grew up in Sudan, but are now U.S. citizens and live in Manchester.

Gabriel said it is an emotional time.

Ibrahim and the couple’s 2-year-old son have been in jail since September.

The family hopes the U.S. government can help. U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte has written to Secretary of State John Kerry, asking for Ibrahim to be granted political asylum.

U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen is also involved.

Ibrahim could be executed in the next few months.

IS MUSLIM BY BIRTH, AND DANIEL IS CHRISTIAN. NICK SPINETTO IS LIVE IN THE STUDIO WITH DETAILS. THIS IS A STORY OF TWO PEOPLE WHO FELL IN LOVE AND ARE NOW FACING DEATH AS A RESULT. MERRIAM ABRAHAM, A MUSLIM, WAS SENTENCED TO 100 LASHINGS AND DEATH BY HANGING, ALL BECAUSE SHE MARRIED A CHRISTIAN. SHE IS ALSO EIGHT MONTHS PREGNANT. VERY EMOTIONAL RIGHT NOW. HE IS A WORLD AWAY FROM THE CRISIS HIS BROTHER DANIEL IS FACING IN SUDAN. ASKING US TO PRAY. GABRIEL'S PRAYERS STEM FROM THE DAY HIS BROTHER MARRIED MERRIAM ABRAHAM. ON THEIR WEDDING DAY A FEW YEARS AGO, DANIEL AND MERRIAM LOOKED INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES, ANTICIPATING A BRIGHT FUTURE. IT NEVER DID THEY THINK THEY WOULD FIND THEMSELVES HERE FIGHTING TO SAVE HER LIFE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. BOTH DANIEL AND HIS BROTHER GABRIEL WERE BORN IN SUDAN AND ARE U.S. CITIZENS, CHRISTIANS, AND LIVE IN MANCHESTER. TOTAL SHOCK. IN MUSLIM NATIONS, MUSLIM MEN CAN MARRY OUTSIDE THEIR FAITH, BUT MUSLIM WOMEN CANNOT. HER FATHER LEFT WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER SO MERRIAM GREW UP IN A CHRISTIAN HOUSEHOLD. ISLAMIC TRADITION INTERVENED, AND NOW HER LIFE LITERALLY HANGS IN THE BALANCE. SINCE SEPTEMBER, SHE AND THE COUPLE'S TWO-YEAR-OLD SON HAD BEEN IN JAIL. YOU CANNOT BELIEVE THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. THE FAMILY IS HOPING THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CAN HELP. SENATOR KELLY AYOTTE HAS WRITTEN SECRETARY KERRY ASKING FOR MERRIAM TO BE GRANTED POLITICAL ASYLUM. SHE IS A CHRISTIAN, AND SHE IS BEING PERSECUTED AND SENTENCED TO DEATH FOR EXERCISING HER BELIEFS. WE SHOULD ALL CARE ABOUT THAT. SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN'S OFFICE IS ALSO GETTING INVOLVED. SHE SAYS, THE SENTENCING OF MARY M ABRAHAM IS A VIOLATION OF FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS AND UNIVERSAL HUMAN RIGHTS. NO MAN OR WOMAN ANYWHERE SHOULD BE TREATED AS A CRIMINAL, MUCH LESS SENTENCED TO HANG IN, FOR EXERCISING THE BASIC RIGHTS OF RELIGIOUS CHOICE.
