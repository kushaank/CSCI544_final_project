The 'big-ticket questions, such as Palestinian sovereignty, claims to Jerusalem, and the "right of return" ' are very relevant to the day-to-day lives of Palestinians.

I suggest that this day should be Oct. 23, 1950. On that date, the Republic of South Korea frigate Duman (PF-61) was commissioned in Yokosuka, Japan, after the warship had been maintained and overhauled by Japanese shipyard workers.

The shipyard in Yokosuka and the Duman had histories that involved many of the stresses of the 20th century. On that day, however, the officers and crew from the Republic of Korea came “as equals” to a Japanese shipyard to take possession of, and then commission, the warship into the ROK Navy. Equally, the Japanese workers rose above a century of antagonism and worked diligently to prepare the ROKS Duman for service. Japan and Korea had become equal and friendly democratic neighbors.

Regarding the May 5 commentary “To work, Mideast peace must first address daily concerns,” by Matthew Longo, Daphna Canetti, and Nancy Hite-Rubin: The lived aspects of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are indeed the core of the conflict, and ending Israel’s occupation and settlement projects in the illegally occupied territories should most certainly be a priority. However the “big-ticket questions, such as Palestinian sovereignty, claims to Jerusalem, and the ‘right of return’ of displaced Palestinians” are also very relevant to the day-to-day lives of Palestinians.
