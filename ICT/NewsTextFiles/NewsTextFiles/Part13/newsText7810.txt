
Minister of Land and Marine Resources Jairam Seemungal said he is calling upon Opposition Leader Dr Keith Rowley to revoke the appointment of People’s National Movement (PNM) Senator Avinash Singh’s because he was engaging in an “illegal  process of land grabbing”.

Seemungal said the media also sensationalised the issue regarding squatters.

Via a telephone interview yesterday, Singh said Seemungal was trying to hoodwink the population  from the real issue which revolved around the threat to the  livelihood of about 200 farming families.
