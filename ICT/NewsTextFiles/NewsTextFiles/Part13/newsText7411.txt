
BACOLOD City , Philippines   – Vice President Jejomar Binay on Saturday assured the public that they won’t find his name in the so-called ‘Napolist,’ or official list of conspirators of alleged pork barrel scam mastermind Janet Lim-Napoles.

“I’m not part of it. You can never find my name there. I was a mayor at that time,” Binay told ABS-CBN Bacolod, referring to the period when the anomaly took place.

He described as unfortunate the alleged involvement of several lawmakers in the scam.

But he said that there are other government officials whose names were listed to have benefited from the anomaly but they didn’t have any involvement.

Meanwhile, Binay visited the Burgos North Public Market here and stressed that this is part of his job and not a form of campaigning.

He said that although he has confirmed that he is running for president in 2016, his work remains his focus at this point.

“There is a time for that,” said Binay, who also serves as chairman of the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council.

His rival in the 2010 vice presidential race, Manuel Roxas II, is dubbed “Mr. Palengke” due to the reforms he instituted in the market during his stint as trade secretary.
