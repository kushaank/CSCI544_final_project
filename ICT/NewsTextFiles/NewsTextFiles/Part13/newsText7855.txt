Meanwhile, massive protests erupted at Drang Lasipora area of Central Kashmir after a littered shell exploded with a bang killing the 12-year old daughter of a farmer on the spot and leaving his 11-year old son injured.

Protestors alleged that due to military drills in the past, shells lie scattered in and around Tosa Maidan and today one of the shell exploded and claimed the life of an innocent girl. Reports said that Simran Akhtar (9) and her brother Fayaz Ahmed Parrey were returning home from their school when near Zompathri Nallah near Lassipora Drang, a powerful shell exploded with a huge bang leaving the sibling in a pool of blood.

Scores of people rushed to the spot and found Simran Akhtar dead while according to reports her brother had received fatal injuries and both his legs were smashed. Another kid also suffered minor injuries.

Reports said that the injured Fayaz was shifted to Srinagar hospital where he is battling for life. People took to streets and staged a protest in the area alleging that shells lie scattered everywhere in and around Tosa Maidan.

For the past few years, littered explosives, shells and live ammunition have killed more than 30 people and injured more than two dozen others across Jammu and Kashmir. Most of the victims are children. In 2009 alone, 14 people including children were killed when scattered shells went off while 22 others sustained injuries.

The Tosa Maidan Bachao Front, while expressing anguish over the death of minor girl, said that it has no other option but to initiate an uprising against âillegal occupationâ of Tosa Maidan if the lease cancellation order is not issued. âWe warn the government to issue the cancellation order in black and white before 25 May to avoid agitation,â it said.
