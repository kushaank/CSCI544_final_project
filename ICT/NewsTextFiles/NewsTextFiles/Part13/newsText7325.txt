
ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico — Albuquerque police say officers will use a new high-tech vehicle aimed at deescalating conflicts with suspects battling mental illness.

Police Chief Gorden Eden said Wednesday the new unit will be part of "intelligence-based negotiations" that will give negotiators as much information as possible during crisis cases.

He says the vehicle will be equipped with communication and computer equipment and will give officers better background information and history on each subject.

The move comes as the city and the Department of Justice are finalizing a plan for ordered reforms following a harsh report into Albuquerque police's use of force.

The report also said Albuquerque police often used unnecessary force on suspects battling mental illness.
