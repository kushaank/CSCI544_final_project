
Some 30 hostages abducted by Tuareg rebels in northern Mali on Saturday have been freed, the UN says.

The hostages, some of them civil servants, were taken when rebels launched an attack in the town of Kidal to coincide with a visit by the PM.

Moussa Mara had been visiting to try to revive peace talks with the rebels.

There was no word on any negotiations behind the release but the UN peacekeeping force said the hostages were in a reasonable condition.
