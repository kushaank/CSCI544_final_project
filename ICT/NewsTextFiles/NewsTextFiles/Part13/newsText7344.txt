
A renowned New Zealand public health scientist has been named to lead a new commission aimed at ending childhood obesity.

Sir Peter Gluckman is a highly respected paediatrician who specialises in hormonal biology and is also the Prime Minister's Science Advisor.

Mr Gluckman will act as a co-chair of the Commission, alongside Pakistan's former Minister of Science and Education, Dr Sania Nishtar.

The international body will include global experts who will work in two groups: one to review the science behind childhood obesity and another working group that will work with implementing and monitoring measures to tackle the global health issue.

"I am honoured to accept this important role and thank the Prime Minister for his support in my doing so," says Mr Gluckman.

"I look forward to working with Dr Nishtar and other distinguished Commissioners to recommend a plan of action and accountability".

Mr Gluckman says that the solutions to obesity are complex, as there are many sides of the issue to consider including biological and behavioural factors.

A report is expected from the Commission in early 2015.
