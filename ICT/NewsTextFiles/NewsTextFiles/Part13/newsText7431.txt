
We took the opportunity to explore Intramuros, and walked the walled cities myriad of streets. We visited Fort Santiago where Jose Rizal, a famous Philippine martyr went to his death. The fort has been occupied since 1571 by the Spanish, British, Japanese and the Americans. It was well worth the 75 peso entry fee and a couple of hours can easily be spent there enjoying the history and ambience.

We visited Manila Cathedral, first built in 1571 and destroyed by both earthquakes and fires since (7 times), then totally destroyed in 1945 in the Battle of Manila. It was reconstructed in 1958, elevated to the rank of Basilica Minore by Pope John Paul II in 1983 and now named Basilica of the Immaculate Conception.

That evening we visited a restaurant called Ristorante Delle Mitre, opposite the San Agustin Church. This amazing place was full of religious items, the menu had the favourite meals of eminent clergy and the quality of the food was probably the best we had tried in Manila. We will probably go back there.

The evening finished quite late although we were in bed by 9pm. The band (noise) from the courtyard below in our hotel went on until 10.43 precisely, prompting my wife to go down stairs and ask when it would end. She was assured it wouldn't happen tomorrow, we shall see!
