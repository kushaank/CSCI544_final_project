
The David Posnack Jewish Day School said it would expand its Davie campus with a $6 million high school complex.

Funded by donations, the project is slated to break ground in September and be ready by the 2015-16 school year. It will be located on the north side of the Lower School building.

Jewish Day Schoolâ€™s high school class has grown from 128 to 170 students over the past two years and its middle school enrollment has increased as well, Richard Cuenca , the head of school, said in a news release. School officials said that its current high school building wonâ€™t be big enough to accommodate the larger classes by 2015-16, hence the new Fischer High School building.

The new facilities would include 17 classrooms, art and rehearsal spaces, science labs, a lecture hall, a student activities lounge, a library/media center, a TV production studio and a two-story glass atrium.

â€œBuilding a new state-of-the art facility that will house a community Jewish Day School High School will provide the foundation for a global vision of a vibrant Jewish future,â€� Cuenca said in a news release.

The fundraising for the project is ongoing.
