
The Lancaster County Attorney's Office had the same evidence in the third-offense DUI charge against Bradley Diekmann, and the same result.

In an order Friday, District Judge Steven Burns said the state essentially argued that District Judge Paul Merritt Jr.'s decision Sept. 9, 2013, was wrong.

"The state had the ability to appeal Judge Merritt's earlier decision if it wished review of that decision. It chose not to," Burns wrote.

With that, he dismissed it.

The case dates back to Dec. 1, 2012, shortly before midnight, when dispatchers sent a Lincoln police officer to the Links, an apartment complex at 491 Fletcher Ave., on a complaint of loud music coming from a Chevy Impala.

The officer found Diekmann in the driver's seat, holding a plastic cup with ice and brown liquid, slurring his speech with the smell of alcohol on his breath.

The key was in the ignition, but in the accessory position.

Diekmann, who declined field sobriety tests and a blood-alcohol test, denied he'd been driving.

The officer arrested him.

In an order in September, Merritt wrote that clearly there was sufficient evidence to establish probable cause that Diekmann was intoxicated.

"However, I find there was not evidence sufficient to establish probable cause that he had been operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol," the judge said.

Merritt said there was no evidence that anyone saw Diekmann park the car or when it was parked or that the only way it could have been parked there would have been by Diekmann driving it there.

The state re-filed the case Nov. 8, which led to Friday's dismissal.
