
PANAJI:  Tehelka founder editor  Tarun Tejpal was released late Monday evening after the  Supreme Court granted him interim bail for three weeks to attend and perform the last rites of his mother  Shakuntala Tejpal, who expired on Sunday.

After release from Sada sub-jail, Vasco, Tejpal rushed to the St Inez crematorium at Panaji but was unable to perform the last rites on his mother as the sun had already set when he reached there. His younger brother Minty performed the last rites. Tarun is the eldest.

"After hearing learned counsel for the parties and in view of the fact that the petitioner (Tejpal) has lost his mother yesterday and today at 4.30pm, her cremation is to take place at Panaji, Goa, we grant interim bail for a period of three weeks to the petitioner to the satisfaction of Vijaya D Pol, additional sessions judge, (fast track), North Goa, Panaji," a division bench of the Supreme Court stated on Monday.

The apex court made it clear that the interim bail has been granted only on humanitarian grounds in view of Tejpal's mother's demise and will have no bearing in the disposal of the main case. Another of Tejpal's bail application is pending before the SC.

Jail superintendent Gaurish Sankhwalkar told TOI that after receiving a copy of the Supreme Court order, jail authorities released Tejpal. "We have taken Tejpal's signature on original bond copy of Rs 1 lakh before releasing him from jail," Sankhwalkar said.

Tejpal's counsel Sandeep Kapoor told TOI that the interim bail application was moved before the apex court on Monday morning. Kapoor said Tejpal will have to surrender before the authorities after three weeks.

Tejpal, who is accused of raping a young journalist, at a starred hotel in Goa in November 2013 was in judicial custody for nearly six months before his release on Monday.

On March 11 Tejpal's mother was admitted to a private hospital in Mapusa after suffering from convulsions.
