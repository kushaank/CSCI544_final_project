Monday afternoon could be a busy day at the Multnomah County building.

A judge is expected to issue his ruling at noon on whether Oregon's ban on same-sex marriage violates constitutional rights. It's likely Judge Michael McShane will strike the ban down, paving the way for gay couples across Oregon to tie the knot.

It would be Multnomah County's second crack at doling out marriage licenses to gay couples. The county became Oregon's first to recognize same-sex marriage back in 2004, but Oregon voters approved the constitutional ban just months later, putting a stop to Multnomah County's practice.

Ironically, when several couples filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the ban, Multnomah County was listed as a defendant for refusing to grant marriage licenses to gay couples. The county responded by joining Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum and Gov. John Kitzhaber in refusing to defend the ban, calling it "discriminatory and unconstitutional."

All five of the county's elected commissioners support marriage equality, and County Chairwoman Marissa Madrigal has said workers in the county's Department of Assessment, Recording and Taxation are ready to begin issuing marriage licenses as soon as possible, if McShane rules against the ban.

The Oregonian's reporters and photographers will be covering McShane's ruling, and if he votes the ban down, we'll be on hand as couples line up to get marriage license. Continue following Oregonlive for the latest.
