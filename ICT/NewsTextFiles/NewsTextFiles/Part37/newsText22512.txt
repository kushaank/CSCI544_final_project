
The Obama administration is trying to scare us with totally unverifiable projections of a disastrous global warming. We trust that most people are not going to fall for this outrageous scare-mongering.

The ballyhooed third National Climate Assessment, recently released by several agencies, alleges first, the world has warmed over the last century and second, it’s going to get much worse.

This is supposed to convince us of the wisdom of President Obama’s plans to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, the chief gas said to be warming the planet.

It has indeed warmed slightly (by at most 1.9 degrees Fahrenheit) over the past 100 years. Saying so ignores an unexplained cooling from about 1940 into the 1970s. It warmed from the 1970s to 1998; there has been no warming since even as carbon dioxide concentrations rose.

Predictions of floods here and heat waves there and falling sky somewhere else are produced by already failed computer models. None can reproduce changes in temperature observed in the past. Relying on such failed prophets is folly.

Unsurprised critics note that the concentrations of water vapor in the troposphere that are supposed to amplify warming simply aren’t there.

The assessment rambles about heat and rainfall and other unpleasantness, but pays no attention to the fact that there is no trend in the incidence of tornadoes, or the fact that hurricanes making landfall are at a record low, or the fact that even more emission cuts than Obama wants would lower the temperature in 2100 by one-seventh of a degree.
