
CATTLE on feed figures continue to rise, with the latest Australian Lot Feeders’ Association (ALFA) and Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) quarterly feedlot survey showing an 8 per cent increase on the previous quarter.

The result represented the highest quarter result in terms of cattle numbers on feed since December 2006.

ALFA president Don Mackay said the survey result was driven by both an influx of cheaper drought affected cattle entering the feedlot sector at the end of that period as well as heightened demand for Australian beef overseas.

Feeder steer and heifer prices were down 2pc and 4pc from the December average or 4pc and 9pc year-on-year.

“The increases in cattle numbers on feed were mainly felt in Queensland, NSW and WA, results considered hardly surprising given ongoing drought conditions and the increased demand for grain fed cattle – a normal season occurrence this time of year in the west,” Mr Mackay said.

Darling Downs wheat and barley averaged $346/tonne and $334/ tonne for the March quarter, up 23pc and 17pc year-on-year respectively. Darling Downs cereal fodder prices also rose to $425/tonne, a 55pc increase.

Grain fed beef exports for the March quarter were up 12pc year-on-year to 52,515 tonnes swt, with declines to Japan offset by increases to China, the Middle East the EU and the USA, according to MLA manager for market information and analysis, Tim McRae.

Quarterly grain fed beef exports to Japan declined 4pc year-on-year while they increased 19pc in South Korea, 47pc in China, 77pc in the EU, 38pc in the Middle East and over 200pc into the US.
