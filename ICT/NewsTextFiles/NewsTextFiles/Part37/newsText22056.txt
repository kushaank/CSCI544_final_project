
Jordan Belfort, The Wolf of Wall Street, expects to earn more this year than he made at his peak as a stock broker, allowing him to repay all of his victims.

“I’ll make this year more than I ever made in my best year as a broker,” Belfort told a conference in Dubai on Monday. “My goal is to make north of $100 million."

That way, he says, "I am paying back everyone this year."

Jordan Belfort, a motivational speaker, will use his earnings from a 45-city speaking tour in the U.S. to repay about $50 million to investors he bilked.

That was his share of the fine he was slapped with.

Belfort spent 22 months in jail for money laundering and securities fraud in the 1990s after his firm defrauded investors out of more than $200 million.

That infamous story was retold last year in a blockbuster film starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Belfort, based on his memoir The Wolf of Wall Street.

“After six months of putting all the profit from the U.S. tour into an escrow account, it will go directly back to investors,” Belfort said in an interview .

His firm was shut down in 1998 and jailed in 2003. The U.S. government set up a $110.4 million victim-compensation fund that must receive half his income.

Belfort admits he fleeced investors, cheated on spouses, and was once so addicted to drugs that he kicked his wife down the stairs in front of his daughter.

He still maintains most of his activities were legal.

In Dubai, the $100 million film that earned DiCaprio a Golden Globe award, was cut by a quarter for multiple scenes depicting drug use and sex.
