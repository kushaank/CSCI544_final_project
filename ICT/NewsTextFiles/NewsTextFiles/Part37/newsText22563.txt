
California lifted its ban on same-sex marriage last June. Oregon supporters hope to celebrate the same decision today.

Oregon United for Marriage will be hosting a gathering of advocates at its headquarters, at 727 N.E. 24 th Ave. The group will read McShaneâ€™s opinion to the crowd, then hold a press conference.

Between 12:30 p.m. and 10 p.m., some marriages could take place (depending on the ruling) at the Melody Ballroom, at 615 S.E. Alder St. Whereas Oregon requires a three-day waiting period after couples receive marriage licenses, they can receive a waiver by paying an extra $5 to $20, depending on the county, for their licenses.

In Eugene, advocates will gather at the Davis Restaurant, 94 N. Broadway.

McShane is ruling on whether to strike down Oregonâ€™s 10-year-old ban on same-sex marriage. The state decided not to defend the ban.
