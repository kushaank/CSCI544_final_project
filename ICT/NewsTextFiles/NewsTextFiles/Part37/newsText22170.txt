
The defense chiefs of Japan, South Korea and the United States will hold talks on May 31 in Singapore to bolster trilateral cooperation amid threats from North Korea's missile and nuclear development, Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said Monday.

The trilateral meeting of Onodera and his U.S. and South Korean counterparts Chuck Hagel and Kim Kwan Jin will take place on the sidelines of the Asia Security Summit that runs from May 30 to June 1 in Singapore.

The three defense chiefs last met in June last year on the fringes of the regional gathering known as the Shangri-La Dialogue.

Onodera said during a speech in Tokyo on Monday that he plans to meet one-on-one with U.S. Defense Secretary Hagel, adding that three-way talks that involve Australian Defense Minister David Johnston are now also being arranged.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to deliver a keynote speech at the annual meeting, where defense and military chiefs from the Asia-Pacific region gather to discuss security issues.

Alarmed by China's growing maritime assertiveness, and North Korea's missile and nuclear programs, Japan is trying to rework its postwar security policy and strengthen its ties with Southeast Asian nations, particularly Vietnam and the Philippines, which are locked in territorial disputes with Beijing in the South China Sea.

Japan's relations with China remain chilled over conflicting claims to sovereignty over the Senkaku Islands, called Diaoyu in China, in the East China Sea.
