WHEN Geert Wilders, the leader of the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) spoke at a gathering of Eurosceptic parties in Italy last December, he wore a green tie in solidarity with the Italian Northern League, even though he doesn't like the colour. It is unlikely that this will be the last concession he may make to placate his new Eurosceptic friends if they manage to build an alliance after this week’s European Parliament elections. Forming a political group, which need at least 25 seats, is a key way to get things done in Europe. But data from Votewatch show that whereas the mainstream parties vote the same way about 90% of the time, nationalist parties did so only around half the time. Our chart depicts the degree to which their votes overlap. It ranges from a chilly 33% (between Britain’s and Slovakia’s nationalists) to 86% (in a show of French-Austrian amité). Besides, the parties' bosses are already sniping over who is the leader among the Eurosceptics. “The likelihood of them staying together as a group is limited” says Doru Frantescu of Votewatch.
