
RENO, Nev. (AP) — Sentencing has been pushed back until September for a Reno businessman convicted of defrauding the U.S. government out of $200,000 in grants from a faith-based initiative.

U.S. District Judge Miranda Du agreed to postpone June's scheduled sentencing after Mike Stickler's public defenders said he asked them to request a new lawyer.

Du agreed and appointed a former assistant U.S. attorney as counsel, Craig Denney of Reno. The change also forces postponement of his trial on separate tax evasion charges set for June 3.
