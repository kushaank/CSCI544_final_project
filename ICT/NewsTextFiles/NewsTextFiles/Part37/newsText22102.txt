
Ex-Beatle Paul McCartney has cancelled his  Japan tour due to illness, organizers said Tuesday, days after apologizing to  fans for missing a pair of weekend concerts.

He "will regrettably have to cancel the remaining Japanese shows. Paul is still not feeling better and this cancellation is unavoidable,'' organiser Kyodo  Tokyo said in a statement, AFP reports.

The 71-year-old English pop veteran -- one of two living members of the  Beatles -- had already cancelled planned performances at the National Stadium  Saturday and Sunday, after coming down with an unspecified virus.

He had planned to play a concert at another stadium in Tokyo on Wednesday  and the last one in Osaka on Saturday.

He also had planned to play on Monday to make up for the cancelled Saturday  show.

"I was really looking forward to playing in Japan again after we had such  an amazing time here in November,'' McCartney was quoted as saying in the  statement.

"So, to cancel these shows as well as the National Stadium shows is hugely  disappointing for me as well,'' he said.

"I'd like to thank my Japanese fans for their love, messages of support and  understanding.

"I hope to see you all again soon. Love, Paul,'' he added.

In an earlier tour of Japan in November last year, McCartney was seen  singing 39 songs non-stop without retreating backstage.

Organisers said they were exploring "all possibilities'' to reschedule the  four-date tour.
