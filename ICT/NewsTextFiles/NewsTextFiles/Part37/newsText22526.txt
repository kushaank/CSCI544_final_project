
Philippines mobile operators Smart Communications, Globe Telecom and Sun Cellular plan to file a protest with the Court of Appeals against the National Telecommunications Commission's (NTC) order to refund subscribers some PHP 7 billion for overcharging them 20 cents for off-net text messages, the Manila Times reports. The operators have until 25 May to file the claim. Last week, the NTC ordered the three mobile operators to reimburse their subscribers 20 cents for off-net text messages sent to other networks. This happened after the NTC declined the motion for reconsideration filed by the telecommunication companies in December 2012. The operators had challenged an October 2011 directive to reduce interconnection charges for SMS.
