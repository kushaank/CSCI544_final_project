
Former X Factor judge Tulisa will go on trial this morning, charged with "drunkenly attacking" a celebrity blogger.

The N-Dubz star , who has pleaded not guilty to assault, is accused of attacking blogger Savvas Morgan (Vas J Morgan) at V Festival in Chelmsford last summer.

Celebrity blogger Vas Morgan claimed the 25-year-old star charged towards him in a "drunken and angry state" in a backstage area at the event in August.

But in a statement issued at the time, a representative for Tulisa said: "Tulisa strongly denies assaulting Mr Morgan. She specifically denies punching Mr Morgan in the eye.

"She has placed this matter in the hands of her lawyers for immediate and appropriate action."
