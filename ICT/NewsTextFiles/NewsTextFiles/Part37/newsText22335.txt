
CHITUNGWIZA magistrate Estere Chivasa has issued a warrant of arrest for self-styled "prophet" Admire Dovi, who allegedly skipped trial last Thursday in a matter where he is accused of raping a 15-year-old girl.

Dovi, of the Ministry of God International Church, is alleged to have raped the teenage girl sometime in February this year claiming he wanted to exorcise a spiritual husband who was haunting her.

The State alleges that on an unknown date, but sometime in February, the complainant and her boyfriend Munyaradzi America, met the accused in Unit L, Chitungwiza.

The trio allegedly proceeded to America's place of residence in Unit M.

They sat in a tuckshop where Dovi asked about the pair's relationship.

Late in the evening, Dovi allegedly instructed America to go outside so that he could prophesy to his girlfriend.

He then went on to say her that she had a spiritual husband who was haunting her.

Dovi said he would cleanse her of the demon.

America then immediately came back and asked Dovi to leave the place, but the latter refused and proposed that they should all sleep inside the tuckshop.

America and his girlfriend obliged and agreed that the complainant sleeps in the middle.

During the night, Dovi allegedly f*ndled the complainant's breasts and stopped only after she raised alarm.

The complainant was advised to go and sleep in the spare bedroom where the accused followed.

Dovi said he also wanted to sleep in the same blankets with her.

The accused allegedly started f*ndling her breasts and forcibly removed her clothes and had sex with her.

After the act, the accused got out and then took the complainant to his friend, Lucia Mutsetse, to stay there until he could marry her.

The matter only came to the fore on April 10 when the complainant spilled the beans to her relatives, leading to Dovi's arrest.
