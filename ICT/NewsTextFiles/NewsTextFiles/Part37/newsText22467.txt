PARIS/CANNES:  Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn has instructed  lawyers to sue the makers of a movie in which  veteran French star Gerard Depardieu plays a sex addict who commits a  sexual assault on a hotel maid, his lawyer said on Monday.

'Welcome to New York' by Abel Ferrara, which had a private screening on the sidelines of the Cannes film festival at the weekend and has been on pay-per-view in France, is billed as a piece of fiction and comes with a legal disclaimer. But Strauss-Kahn's lawyer said the film was defamatory in that its subject matter was similar to the accusations levelled against Strauss-Kahn, who quit the Washington-based International Monetary Fund in 2011 after a New York hotel maid accused him of sexual assault. Strauss-Kahn settled a civil case taken by the maid after criminal charges were dropped.

"This happened three years ago and he was cleared," lawyer Jean Veil told Europe 1 radio on Monday. Filmmaker Ferrara said the film was fiction and that he had the right to choose his subjects. "I'm not on trial," Ferrara said. "I'm an artist, I have freedom of speech."
