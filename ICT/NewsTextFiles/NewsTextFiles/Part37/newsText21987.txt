
A father drowned while trying to save his four-year old son after he was swept out to sea from a Jamaican beach.

Tony Wilkinson, 49, was caught in a strong current as he tried to help Jake who had got into trouble paddling along Treasure Beach.

The family, who live in Kent, had gone for a walk along Calabash Bay.

Mr Wilkinson, who was described as 'incredibly fit and strong,' ran after Jake, but was caught in a powerful undertow and swept away.

In a statement, his family said: "Tony Wilkinson and his partner Decca Aitkenhead were on holiday in a village on the south coast of Jamaica with their two sons, aged three and four.

"At 8.30 on Thursday morning one of their sons was paddling in the waves and got pulled out to sea. Tony swam out and rescued him.

"Decca swam out and brought their son to shore but the current was too strong for Tony to swim back, and despite the efforts of local fishermen who swam out to help, he drowned before they could get him back to shore."
