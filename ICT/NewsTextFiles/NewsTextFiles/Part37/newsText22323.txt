
WASHINGTON, May 19, 2014 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ --Â Family Research Council (FRC) responded to a decision today by U.S. District Court Judge Michael McShane striking down Oregon's amendment defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman.

"This is another lawless decision that the Supreme Court has not provided any precedent for. The Supreme Court has said nothing that would give a federal judge the right to redefine marriage. In fact, the Supreme Court has granted stays in comparable cases which this judge failed to do.

"The judge's disregard for the rule of law and for the voters of Oregon is breathtaking. The state's failure to defend its own constitution, and the failure of an openly homosexual judge to recuse himself, demonstrate that this decision is without basis.

"If the courts believe they are going to resolve this issue once and for all by forcing a redefinition of marriage on the American people, they are wrong. The far reaching decision in Roe v. Wade was intended to resolve the issue of abortion, which 41 years later we know conclusively it did not. The definition of marriage, like the sanctity of human life, is seen in the natural or moral law. The decisions of courts can ignore it, they can even attempt to suppress it, but they will never eradicate it," concluded Perkins.
