
A constitutional lawyer, Dr. Tunji Abayomi, has asked the court to declare that the National Assembly has no power to increase by N53 billion the budget estimate submitted to it by the President Goodluck Jonathan.

He is asking the court to declare as illegal the N53 billion increase in the 2014 budget passed by the National Assembly.

In the suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/319/14, Abayomi asked the court to determine whether it was within the constitutional powers of the National Assembly to increase the budget estimate submitted to it by the president.

He asked the court to restrain the defendants from creating new expenditure/budget estimate submitted by the president for passage.

The lawyer also asked the court to determine whether the National Assembly could create a new expenditure/budget head in a budget estimate submitted by the president for passage/approval.

Abayomi also asked the court to declare that it was not within the constitutional powers of the National Assembly to increase the budget estimate submitted by the president for passage.

In an affidavit in support of the suit deposed to by Uzoanya Kelechi Victoria, the plaintiff said the increase in the budget by the National Assembly amounted to constitutional infringement and a wrongful exercise of legislative powers under the constitution.

The constitutional lawyer said the budget estimate passed on April 9 by the National Assembly was unilaterally increased by N53 billion.

No date has been fixed for the hearing of the case.
