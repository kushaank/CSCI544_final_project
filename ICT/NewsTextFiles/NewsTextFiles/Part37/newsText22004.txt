
Jack Kingston and David Perdue made final stops in Albany before the primary election Tuesday.

Kingston visited the Eagles of America Terminal Monday morning. He is running for the open senate seat vacated by Saxby Chambliss. There are seven people in the GOP race and a runoff in July is expected. But Kingston likes how the race has gone.

"The more people have learned about some of the opponents in here, the better that I look," said Kingston. "Because they know I'm tested, been asked tough questions and made tough votes. I've been in tough situations but I come through with a conservative, pro-Georgia agenda."

Kingston says if they have a strong showing from southwest Georgia, he thinks he will be okay for the runoff.

Meanwhile the latest poll shows David Perdue in a slight lead. He stopped by Albany Monday afternoon to talk to supporters where he made a final push before election day.

"Small business is the engine for job creation in America. Between Dodd-Frank and the EPA and other regulators we just have put so many barriers up for small business to grow," said Perdue. "That's the first priority the second priority is gonna be term limits."

WALB will be bringing results as they come in throughout the day on election day.
