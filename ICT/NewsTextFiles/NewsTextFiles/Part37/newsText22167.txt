
TOKYO--The Japanese publisher of a comic that came under fire for linking radiation exposure at Fukushima to nosebleeds acknowledged Monday it had caused alarm and promised a review after the prime minister stepped into a growing row.

The popular â€œOishinboâ€� (â€œGourmetsâ€�) drew criticism in late April when it showed its main character, a newspaper reporter, having a nosebleed after visiting the tsunami-crippled nuclear plant.

The manga caused uproar among people living in Fukushima, who already complain of discrimination, as well as pro-nuclear politicians who maintain there is no proven causal relationship between exposure to radiation and nosebleeds.

They charged the comic would add fuel to rumors that have scared people away from farm and fishery products from the region, even if they comply with safety standards.

Unlike comics in the West, manga are treated as a serious art form in Japan, on a par with novels, and are widely read among the adult population.

They often take complex or current issues as their subject matter and can be influential in shaping public opinion.

Author Tetsu Kariya has insisted that the episode of his long-running series was based on information he had gathered over two years.

But in the latest edition published Monday, the chief editor of the weekly magazine that runs the strip acknowledged it had caused alarm.

â€œWe have received a lot of criticism and complaints. As the editor in chief, I am aware of my responsibility for the unpleasant feelings this has generated,â€� said Hiroshi Murayama.

The comments came after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe weighed in during a weekend visit to Fukushima, where the coastline was wrecked by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.

â€œThere is no confirmation that anyone's health has been directly affected by radioactive substances,â€� Abe said after visiting the Fukushima Medical University where he was brief on the issue.

In front of media cameras, the premier tasted cherries and helped plant rice seedlings at farms in the main city of Fukushima, some 60 kilometers away from the plant.

Although the natural disaster that sparked the accident left more than 18,000 people dead, the nuclear catastrophe â€” the world's worst in a generation â€” is not officially recorded as having directly killed anyone.

While most scientific opinion says there is minimal risk to the population from the released radiation, there is widespread distrust of the government and regulators.

The Truth Must Be Listened To! The people in TEPCO that withheld the real radiation information from both the US Navy and the people around the world should be prosecuted for crimes against humanity! TEPCO was aware of the level of this disaster that was without question due to their own negligence! TEPCO also had the opportunity to supply the radiation detox mineral Zeolite to those that had become contaminated with radiation! I know because my company offered TEPCO a 100 percent FREE shipping container of ready to take medical grade micronized powdered zeolite that was enough to safely remove radiation and heavy metals from thousands of people! This free Zeolite offer came just after the disaster occurred and I put it through the Japanese consulate in Washington DC as well as directly through their satellite office in Washington DC! This same offer was also put out to the Japanese Government itself also through the Japanese consulate in Washington DC! Both TEPCO and The Japanese Government blew our free Zeolite offer off and refused our Zeolite! So believe me people, both TEPCO and the Japanese Government knew how our Clinoptilolite Zeolite could have helped thousands and thousands of people radiated just after their already gross negligence in allowing this disaster to happen due to TEPCO's refusal to properly secure their nuclear power plant generators by relocating them to higher ground when they were told to do so far before the tsunami occurred!
