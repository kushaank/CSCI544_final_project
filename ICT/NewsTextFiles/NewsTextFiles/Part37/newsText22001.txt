When calculating your total letting income you’ll need to include any amounts received for goods or services related to the letting - such as payments towards utilities or meals.

The main disadvantage of claiming relief under the Rent-a-Room scheme is that you can’t deduct any expenses, which could include letting agent’s fees, accountant’s fees, advertising and a proportion of your household bills.

If you need to complete a tax return you must tell HM Revenue and Customs by 5 October following the end of the tax year. The filing deadline and the date by which payment of tax is due is the following 31 January. There are automatic penalties of between £100 and £1,600 for late filing, depending on the date you file. On top of this, interest and penalties will be payable on late paid tax.
