
Tripp will have to scratch and claw his way to a roster spot as a fifth-round pick. But Miami’s linebacker play was below average and there is a need to improve. Tripp’s best route is to make an impact in training camp and the preseason on special teams.

#Marlins win 7-1, back at .500 (65-65) for 16th time this season. Now 3 out in wild card race.

RT @ MathewScott18 zero chance Incognito plays for the dolphins right? > ZERO isn't a low enough number for that one.

Rob Ninkovich was a 2-year practice squad guy for the Dolphins until the Saints claimed him off the PS. It is a developmental unit for NFL.

Teams can claim players off each other's practice squad, but you have to pay them for a month. Brian Tyms got claimed off Miami's last year.

Sam Brenner's practice squad work against the Dolphins defense convinced Miami he could replace Incognito last year. And he did.

You generally need practice squad guys to help prepare your starters. QB, WR, RB help prepare the defense, CB, S, LB, D-line the offense.

And since you asked, the minimum salary for a practice squad player is $6K a week. For 17 weeks that's $102,000 (or more) before taxes.
