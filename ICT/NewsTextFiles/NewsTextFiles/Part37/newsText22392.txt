
The testimony of a New Zealander at the trial for London cleric, Abu Hamza, has been described as "moving" and "emotional" by a member of the jury.

Hamza, 55, has today been found guilty in federal court in Manhattan. He was charged with conspiring to support terrorists by supplying a satellite phone to the Yemen hostage takers and by trying to set up a terrorist training camp in Bly, Oregon.

New Zealand-born scientist Mary Quin, who was among the 16 tourists taken during a 1998 terrorist attack on tourists in Yemen, gave evidence at the trial in New York.

Ms Quin told the federal court in Manhattan about how she escaped from her kidnapper by putting her foot against his head and wrestling away his assault rifle after he was knocked to the ground by a bullet.

"We were in this huge war of screaming over an AK-47. I was screaming at him and he was screaming at me. I put my foot down on his head and that gave me the leverage to get the gun out of his hands," she told the court.

Jury foreperson Howard Bailynson said Ms Quin's testimony stood out the most to him during the trial.

"I think her testimony was very moving. Very emotional," he told ONE News US correspondent Jack Tame.

"I think her tape of her interview with Abu Hamza spoke in my mind significantly."

Mr Bailynson lauded Ms Quin's courage throughout her ordeal saying: "She's a brave woman having been through what she's been through.

"I can't even fathom or put into words how I'd be having gone through an experience like that."
