
UNITED STATES - May 19, 2014 - Best Lawyers, the oldest and most respected guide to the legal profession, announced the Sixth Edition of The Best Lawyers in New Zealand on May 19, 2014.

Attorneys named to The Best Lawyers in New Zealand were recognized by their peers in the legal industry for their professional excellence in 58 practice areas. In addition, one “Lawyer of the Year” was named in several areas.

The process begins when attorneys are nominated for the honor. They are divided by geographic region and practice areas, and are evaluated by their peers on the basis of professional expertise. Those who receive high peer reviews undergo an authentication process to make sure they are currently practicing and in good standing. Only then can these top attorneys be included.

Best Lawyers is the oldest and most respected attorney ranking service in the world. For more than 30 years, Best Lawyers has assisted those in need of legal services to identify the attorneys best qualified to represent them in distant jurisdictions or unfamiliar specialties. Best Lawyers lists are published in leading local, regional and national publications across the globe.
