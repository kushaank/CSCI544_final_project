
THE International Council of Museums (ICOM) issued a press release from Paris on October 15, 2013 under the caption 'Launch of International Museum Day 2014 — Museum collections make connections'.   In commenting on its choice of theme, ICOM indicated that "the worldwide community of museums will celebrate International Museum Day around 18 May 2014.  This year, the theme of the International Museum Day (IMD) will be 'Museum collections make connections'. This theme is a reminder that museums are living institutions that help creating bonds between visitors, generations and cultures around the world".   The central focus of IMD is to enhance community consciousness about the responsibility of museums in the development of society.

Jamaica, like many countries in the Caribbean, has remained silent on the activities of IMD largely because public and private museums are segregated.  This has contributed to a challenge to develop a museum culture with a high impact factor.  Happily, all is not lost, as works such as Caribbean Heritage edited by Basil A Reid (University of the West Indies Press, 2012) already provide a blueprint as to what needs to be done to bring the Caribbean up to speed in being active participants in international events such as IMD.   Another viable route in getting us there is outlined in the Jamaica Observer article on Monday, April 28, 2014 'Caricom, French Republic forge closer cooperation', which highlighted that France — the seat of ICOM — is desirous of establishing closer ties with the Caribbean community.  This would provide an opportunity for ICOM to expand its visibility in the region, as in Jamaica's case very few museums are members of ICOM.   As the saying goes: "If the mountain won't come to Muhammad then Muhammad must go to the mountain."  In my opinion, this would be an important area in which French assistance would be welcome.   Where there is a will there is a way.
