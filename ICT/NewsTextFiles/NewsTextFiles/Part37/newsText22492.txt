
It's the news that broke the hearts of thousands upon thousands of women (including us!) because while we totally thought George Clooney would be a bachelor forever, he went and proposed to his British girlfriend Amal Alamuddin.

And it looks like the couple don't want to wait to exchange their vows because rumour has it they are set to wed in September.

He only popped the question a couple of weeks ago but apparently friends are waiting on their save the date cards any time now!

A friend of Lebanon-born Amal, who is a human rights lawyer, told the Mail On Sunday : "September 12 is the date they are aiming for.

"Everyone thinks they will marry in Lake Como where George owns a beautiful home but Amal feels that is too public. They are looking to host a small wedding in an Italian village where they can control the photographers. But they haven't decided yet.

"They will then have big parties for her relative in Lebanon and London."

A source told Us Magazine : "He'd marry her today if he could, but he wants to give her a dream wedding."

CUTE!

P.S Amal is so bloody clever and gorgeous - we totally don't blame George for getting down on bended knee! Find out about more about the British beauty here !
