
A Manhattan man has filed the world's largest lawsuit – seeking $2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000 in damages – (yes really, not a typo) - over a dog bite and being overcharged for a cup of coffee.

Anton Purisima has filed his two undecillion dollar lawsuit after he claims his middle finger was bitten and infected by a "rabies-infected" dog on a city bus, that he paid more for coffee than he should have at LaGuardia Airport and a Chinese couple took pictures of him without asking.

Two undecillion dollars or the number two with 36 zeros behind it - is more money than currently exists on the planet.

According to Lowering The Bar , Purisima filed the hand-written lawsuit (below) in a federal court on 11 April and is representing himself. The list of defendents include Au Bon Pain Store, Hoboken University Medical Center and New York City Transit Authority.

It states his pain and additional damages "cannot be repaired by money" and is "therefore priceless". He includes evidence of his injured finger.

Au Bon Pain Store, Carepoint Health, Hoboken University Medical Center, Kmart Store 7749, St. Luke's Emergency Dept., New York City Transit Authority, City of New York, NYC MTA, LaGuardia Airport Administration, Amy Caggiula, Does 1-1000, Case No. 1:14 CV 2755 (S.D.N.Y. filed 4/11/2014).

000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000).

In the last four years, Purisima, who can safely be described as litigious, has filed lawsuits against the People's Republic of China and several major banks including Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, and Wachovia.
