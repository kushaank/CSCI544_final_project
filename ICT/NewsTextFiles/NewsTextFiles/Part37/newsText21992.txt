
Education Minister, Hon. Rev. Ronald Thwaites is urging parents to invest in quality early childhood education for their children to ensure their success at the primary and tertiary levels.

�Sending your children [to a good early childhood institution] is perhaps the best investment you could possibly make in their future. Whatever sacrifice it takes to give our children a good start at early childhood is worth it,� he stated.

Rev. Thwaites was addressing parents at Wonder World Early Childhood Institution�s monthly parenting forum held at the school�s headquarters on Crieffe Road in Kingston, on Friday, May 16.

The forum was held under the theme �Parents take responsibility: break the cycle�.

�This is the most important level of education. All the science we know tells us that by age six or seven a child�s personality is formed and a child�s brain has developed and learning patterns have been established. Therefore, the link between home and school is very important,� he advised.

The Education Minister noted that there are a number of studies that highlight the notion that the early childhood experience is probative of what will take place in a child�s future.

�Historically, in Jamaica we haven�t understood this. We believed that early childhood education was just �keep and care� and that you really just started to learn at the [primary or secondary level],� he stated.

Rev. Thwaites noted that while receiving a sound education at the primary and secondary levels were also important, it is at the early childhood level that the foundation for a good education is set.
