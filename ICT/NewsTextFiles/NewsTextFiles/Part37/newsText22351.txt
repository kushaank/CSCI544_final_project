The Superme Court Monday refused to stall the trial against self-styled godman Asaram Bapu in a sexual assault case pending in Rajasthan.

Justices B S Chauhan and A K Sikri agreed to examine the legal issues relating to determination of the age of the complainant girl, but clarified that no interim relief, including bail, could be granted to Asaram and two other accused.

Asaram’s counsel U U Lalit contested the trial court’s reliance on the girl’s matriculation certificate and treat her as a “child” under the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act. He claimed her school-leaving certificate showed her to be a major on the date of alleged offence.

Lalit also pointed out the alleged discrepancy between the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act and the Juvenile Justice Act in defining a “child” and the procedure to determine the age.
