
GEORGE TOWN: A fruit seller was acquitted and discharged by a High Court here Monday of trafficking in more than 25kg of cannabis two years ago.

Judge Datuk Zamani Abdul Rahim, in acquitting Adnan Amman, 58, of the trafficking charge, ruled that the prosecution had failed to establish a prima facie case against him.

Adnan was alleged to have trafficked in 25,995gm of cannabis by the roadside of Jalan Bukit Ayon in Bayan Lepas, around 3.30am on Oct 2, 2012.

The offence under Section 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 carries the mandatory death sentence upon conviction.

Adnan, who was wearing a white shirt, appeared calm when the judgement was read out in English but teared up as he was led out of the courtroom.

He broke into tears as he hugged his counsel Hussaini Abdul Rashid, shook hands with several policemen and hugged his family members who were present in court.

Deputy public prosecutor Muna Mohamed Jaafar prosecuted the case.

Please wait.
