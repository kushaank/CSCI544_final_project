
(ANSAmed) - ROME, MAY 19 - Eni is monitoring the situation in Libya after an armed attack on Tripoli's parliament, and is working "with continuous attention to personnel safety," the Italian oil giant said Monday.       On Sunday renegade anti-Islamist troops stormed the building and suspended the Islamist-dominated House, accusing it of empowering extremists.

On Monday an Eni spokesman told ANSA that "for the moment, Eni has not taken steps to evacuate employees (from the area), production activities are continuing in line with the first-quarter trend". (ANSAmed).
