
The state prosecutor in Abu Hamza's trial has hailed the jury's unanimous guilty verdict, calling the Islamist cleric "not just a preacher of faith, but a trainer of terrorists".

These trials demonstrate that in an American civilian courtroom, the American people and all the victims of terrorism can be vindicated without sacrificing our principles.  And that is one reason our civilian court system is admired the world over."
