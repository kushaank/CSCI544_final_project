
For the project, scientists identify desired traits such as grain number, branching number for cluster of rice flowers, and grain size, etc. in a rice variety and cross breed this with an existing rice variety for ideal adaptive traits. Scientists then work on backcrossing the resulting line three times. Backcrossing is a crossing of the hybrid with one of its parents or an individual genetically similar to its parent, in order to achieve offspring with a genetic identity which is closer to that of the parent to ensure better rice varieties as it recovers 93.75% of the background of the recipient rice varieties.
