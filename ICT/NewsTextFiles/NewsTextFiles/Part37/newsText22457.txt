
Today 1.8 million pounds of ground beef was recalled by a Detroit meat packing company.

The meat was linked to E. coli infections in four states, so Wolverine Packing Co. issued the notice voluntarily on meat produced between March 31 and April 18, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service Â said.

There are about 11 people who are sick with E. coli O157:H7 in four states, which have yet to be named. The germ can cause food poisoning or hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can be deadly. HUS affects children and the elderly more severely.

The meat packing company shipped its products to distributors in Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri and Ohio, though the report didn't say if these were the four states. It's still not clear why the states were not released. The meat was for restaurant use and not for the National School Lunch Program, federal Department of Defense programs or in catalog sales.

The illnesses were first reported on May 12. FSIS worked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and tied the E. coli cases between April 22 to May 2 to the meat produced by Wolverine Products. There is still an ongoing investigation.

The products recalled have an "EST . 2574B" establishment number. The date is between March 31 and April 18. A full list of recalled products can be seen here .

E. coli O157 can cause severe diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Fever isn't associated with it, but it can also have none of its usual symptoms. People usually get over it in five to 10 days, but in children that are less than five or older people, it can cause HUS, where the kidneys fail. The principal cause of kidney failure in children is HUS, and most of it is caused by E. coli O157.
