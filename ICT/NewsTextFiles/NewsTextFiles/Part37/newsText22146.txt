
While developing countries continue to buy up feature phones, where prices continue to plummet , Japan's feature phones remain resistant to the smartphone substitution seen in western countries. Docomo has also started offering an unlimited voice call service -- a feature that's arguably more comfortable on longer-shaped feature phones and another reason for the carrier to continually refresh its gara-kei lineup.

Fujitsu's latest model, the F-07F , has a 13-megapixel camera, 1,000mAh battery and a 3.3-inch color display: specs that make it a high-end feature phone, but (camera aside) pale in comparison to cheap, entry-level smartphones like the Moto E . Here's one more surprising point: feature phones might cost less to make, but due to carriers subsidies for smartphones (in a bid to keep its customers upgrading), feature phones often cost more per month than mainstay Android devices from the likes of Samsung and Sony. There may have been a few smartphones in flip-phone clothing , but Japan's gara-kei aren't going anywhere soon.
