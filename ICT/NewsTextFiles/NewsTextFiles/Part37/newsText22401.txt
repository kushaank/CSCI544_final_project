A man arrested after a rash of highway shootings in the Kansas City area, including incidents in Blue Springs and Leeâ€™s Summit, has pleaded not guilty to 20 felony counts.

Mohammed Whitaker, 27, of Grandview, entered the pleas Monday in Jackson County Circuit Court in Kansas City.

Prosecutors allege Whitaker opened fire on 10 vehicles from behind the wheel of his car in March and April in Kansas City, Blue Springs and Lee's Summit. Three people were injured.

Investigators also suspected the same shooter in an incident in Leawood, Kansas, but Whitaker is charged only in the Missouri incidents.
