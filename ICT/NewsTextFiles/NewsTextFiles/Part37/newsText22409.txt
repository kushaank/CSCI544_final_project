
MANILA, Philippines - Health and wellness advocate Cory Quirino gladly welcomed the arrival of Flor Essence, distributed in the country by Herbcare Corporation. It’s the same company that pioneered the use and opened the eyes of Filipinos on the wonder remedies provided by a homegrown plant — the ampalaya — through its Charantia tea.

 Cory shares her firm belief in the four Ds: “Being healthy is not about doing it for other people, like being healthy for the sake of family or children. No, you should want it for yourself first. No change can happen unless you want it; the desire must be there and then, of course, with the desire comes the discipline and then the determination, then the drive, and the resulting delight, as you will be delighted with the results,” she explains.
