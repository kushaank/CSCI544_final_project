In his words: "Nine years ago, I almost died due to septic shock. ... My parents were told there is no medical reason I survived. Some people call me a miracle, I call myself lucky. ... Although my amputations have left me with life altering challenges, I see them more as inconveniences than handicaps. I live every day as if it is a gift. I try to show the people who treated me that I value the life they saved. I visit the hospital frequently, sharing my story with other children and their families. I show them that there is hope in a time of darkness."

In their words: "Sean had the determination to overcome these physical challenges with an inner strength I have rarely witnessed. ... The accomplishments of this young man would be astounding for any able-bodied person. Has life dealt Sean a bad hand? Maybe, but Sean has taken this life-altering event and has made it a royal flush. ... Sean is my hero." Dr. Lee S. Segal, professor of orthopaedics and pediatrics, University of Arizona College of Medicine.
