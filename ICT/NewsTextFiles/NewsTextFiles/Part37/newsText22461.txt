
MEDIA COURTHOUSE � Interboro School Board Member Edward M. Murphy was officially ousted from his seat Friday under order of Judge Joseph P. Cronin.

Cronin signed a proposed order from Delaware County District Attorney Jack Whelan and Assistant District Attorney Louis G. Stesis forfeiting Murphy�s claim to the seat and declaring a vacancy on the board. Murphy, a Republican who was elected to represent Region 2 of the school board in November 2011, could not be reached for comment Friday.

The order stemmed from a Jan. 21 civil motion alleging Murphy was unfit for office due to a prior theft conviction.

Murphy was charged in 2006 with selling tickets to a fundraiser for a child whose father had recently died, but pocketing the money and never turning it over to an account created for the funds. The girl�s grandfather reported the theft to Folcroft police, saying the theft amounted to $1,709, according to an affidavit of probable cause attached to the court filing.

Murphy pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor theft by deception charge in June 2007 and was sentenced to one year of probation.

�Because of his conviction, (Murphy) is unauthorized and incapable of holding the office of Interboro School Director and his claim to said office is forfeit,� the complaint argued.

The complaint was premised on Article II, Section 7 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which bars anyone convicted of an �infamous crime� from holding public office.

Murphy did not respond to the January filing or a subsequent motion for default judgment, according to the docket record.

Whelan said Monday that he doesn�t seek out such cases, but does investigate claims when they come to his attention.

In this instance, Whelan said Murphy was contacted and told the offense, though a misdemeanor, rose to the level of an �infamous crime� and that he would therefore have to vacate his seat.

Whelan said Murphy disagreed with that interpretation and did not step down, which forced court action and the eventual ruling by Judge Cronin.

�He never responded to the filing of the petition even after being given multiple opportunities,� said Whelan.

Interboro Solicitor Mike Puppio said state law calls for the seat to be filled by a vote at a public meeting within 30 days of the order. He said he anticipates the board will devise some way to alert any interested applicants in the community about the vacancy and collect the names of potential candidates prior to that vote.
