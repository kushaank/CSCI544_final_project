Trade ministers resumed talks Monday aimed at creating a 12-nation trade pact in the Asia-Pacific region, a process that has stalled due to disagreements between the U.S. and Japan.

The latest round of negotiations, spanning two days in Singapore, isn't expected to yield a deal. But trade officials hope the meetings could help narrow differences between Washington and Tokyo, which have so far hindered a quick deal on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

Monday's proceedings kicked off with a meeting between U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman and Japanese Economy Minister Akira Amari, ahead of further discussions between all 12 delegations, as well as a series of bilateral talks.

The TPP is the main economic component of U.S. President Barack Obama's foreign policy "pivot" to Asia, and is considered a litmus test of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's willingness to challenge special agricultural interests at home.

The U.S.-Japan impasse has so far reduced expectations for a speedy end to the negotiations, which have run on for several years. Bilateral meetings between the two leaders during Mr. Obama's Tokyo visit in April also failed to produce a breakthrough.

But a recent shift on Tokyo's part has raised hopes that the stalemate can be broken. Before this week's meetings, Japan told the U.S. it was willing to reduce tariffs on imports of beef and pork, according to a person close to the talks.

It isn't clear if Japan's concessions on farm-product tariffs will be enough to satisfy the U.S., which has called for the complete elimination of tariffs, without exceptions. Little progress has also been made on market access in the automotive industry--a subject of bitter dispute for decades.

There's also skepticism in Japan over the Obama administration's ability to push any deal through Congress given rising opposition to free-trade deals, especially from within the Democratic Party, and midterm elections in November.

There are many other areas of discussion, such as over access to the U.S. market for Vietnamese sneaker makers or New Zealand's dairy products.

Talks between senior TPP officials last week produced a broad consensus on placing strict limits on activity of state-owned enterprises, which are often seen as a way for states to unfairly support an industry.

But TPP members have to agree on specifics, such as the types of industries in which state-owned firms would be permitted to operate.

TPP members have also yet to bridge gaps in their positions on intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical industry. Poorer members want to curb such protections so that their domestic manufacturers can produce cheap generic drugs, though richer states disagree.

Trade ministers resumed talks Monday aimed at creating a 12-nation trade pact in the Asian-Pacific region, as the U.S. and Japan pushed to reinvigorate a process stalled by bilateral disagreements.

The latest round of negotiations, spanning two days in Singapore, isn't expected to yield a deal. But trade officials hope the meetings could help narrow differences--particularly those between Washington and Tokyo--that have so far hindered a quick deal on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

To this end, U.S. and Japanese delegates held bilateral talks on market access--a contentious issue for both sides--for the first time since late April, Japanese Economy Minister Akira Amari told reporters late Monday, after meetings that included a sit-down with U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman.

But a recent shift on Tokyo's part has raised hopes that the stalemate can be broken. Before this week's meetings, Japan told the U.S. it was willing to reduce tariffs on imports of beef and pork, according to a person close to the talks. Beef and pork are among farm items--the others being rice, wheat, dairy products and sugar--that Japan previously said were off-limits for tariff reductions.

On Monday, Mr. Amari informed other trade officials that "Japan will improve market access for other countries (to sensitive farming sectors) as much as possible," the Japanese minister told reporters.

However, Japanese delegates also explained to other TPP members that Tokyo "cannot commit to complete tariff elimination for sensitive farm items," Mr. Amari added.

Frustrations with such stumbling blocks have prompted trade officials to press for more urgency in negotiations.

"Ideally, all countries should agree on a time frame for completing talks at a chief-negotiator level," Mr. Amari said.
