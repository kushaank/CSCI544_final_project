
Milan, May 19 - A prosecutor Monday rejected a request for the release from jail of a former MP and a former Expo manager arrested on charges of allegedly leading a criminal gang set up to chisel massive bribes from Expo 2015 contracts.     Judge Fabio Antezza declined the request by lawyers acting for former Christian Democrat MP Gianstefano Frigerio and the ex Expo manager Angelo Paris, who were among several people arrested May 9 by investigators probing alleged corruption in deals for the world fair.      Paris last week during interrogation had admitted involvement in bribery and was being quizzed again Monday afternoon.     Frigerio reportedly acted as pointman for bribery bids from the centre right while another former Bribesville protagonist, Primo Greganti, allegedly fielded them for the centre left.
