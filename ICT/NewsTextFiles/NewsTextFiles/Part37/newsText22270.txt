
CANTON, Miss. - "I am the only opponent in the race who has not declared bankruptcy as of this meeting today," that's chancery clerk candidate Ronny Lott defending his record last Thursday when asked about his financial background.

News Channel 12 did some digging on all three candidates running for the Madison county Chancery Clerk seat using the Public Access to Court Electronic Records database.

These documents from the United State Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Mississippi show two candidates filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, Irby Ford filed for in 2006, and David Overby filed in 1998.

Those debts were later discharged for both candidates. News Channel 12 did extensive research to find if Ronny Lott filed for bankruptcy through PACER. We were not able to find any records.

"If a person can't manage their own money, how can they manage millions of dollars of taxpayer dollars," says Lott.

 Overby is certified public accountant claims he filed for bankruptcy because of medical bills. However, in these documents that bill was 325 dollars a small fee compared to other debts.
