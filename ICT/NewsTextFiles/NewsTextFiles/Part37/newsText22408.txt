
City Council will get an update tonight on a request for a $14.5 million loan from the city’s half-cent tax fund that is intended to build an exhibition hall onto the Pueblo Convention Center.

It also will review proposed licensing regulations for retail marijuana growing, product-making and testing businesses.

The work session starts at 5:30 p.m. in council chambers at City Hall, although council is gathering for dinner at 4:45 p.m. in an adjacent conference room. The public can attend both.

The $14.5 million loan request comes from the Pueblo Urban Renewal Authority and the Historic Arkansas Riverwalk of Pueblo, which are the city’s partners in a state-approved Regional Tourism Act grant award that lets Pueblo keep a share of state sales tax for the purpose of building a series of Downtown improvements.

The first improvement on the list is an exhibition hall for the convention center. When the RTA award was granted in 2012, that project was supposed to be funded by private investors, but that didn’t happen, prompting the request for the $14.5 million loan from the half-cent account, which totals about $40 million.

Council pledged the loan earlier this year on the condition that the Pueblo Economic Development Corp. recruit a new employer that needed the exhibition hall. That conditional pledge is set to expire at the end of May.

As for marijuana regulations, council has adopted new zoning laws to allow pot growing, product-making and testing in the city — but no direct retail sales to the public.

This evening, City Attorney Dan Kogovsek will brief council on proposed licensing regulations for those same types of businesses.
