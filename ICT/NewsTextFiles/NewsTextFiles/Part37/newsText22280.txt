ATLANTA -- The Supreme Court of Georgia has reversed a lower court's ruling that granted a stay of execution to Warren Lee Hill.

Hill, who was scheduled to die by lethal injection last July, had his execution postponed after a Fulton County judge granted an injunction to review the constitutionality of the new drug cocktail used in the state's executions.

In a 5-to-2 decision released Monday, Georgia's high court wrote that the 2013 statute protecting the identities of those who supply the drug is not unconstitutional.

Hill was convicted of murdering his 18-year-old ex-girlfriend in 1985 and was sentenced to life in prison. On Aug. 17, 1990, he used a board embedded with nails to beat fellow inmate Joseph Handspike to death. Hill received the death penalty for Handspike's murder.

Attorneys have filed multiple appeals and proceedings on Hill's behalf, saying he is mentally retarded and therefore ineligible for the death penalty. His execution has been delayed more than once.
