
A longtime adviser to Texas Gov. Rick Perry is in critical condition after a motorcycle crash in Central Texas.

The Austin American-Statesman reports Jay Kimbrough crashed his motorcycle around 6 p.m. Friday.

The newspaper reported that Trooper Jessie Jordan, a Department of Public Safety investigator, said witnesses told police that Kimbrough was driving his Harley-Davidson on the grassy median between state Highway 6 south of Navasota.

Jordan said the witnesses reported that it did not appear that Kimbrough had been forced into the median by a vehicle and that it was unclear why he was riding there. Jordan said Kimbrough crashed when he ran into a turnaround between the lanes.

Kimbrough was taken to St. Joseph Hospital in Bryan, where he remained in critical condition Saturday evening, officials said.

Kimbrough has had a storied career in Texas government and has served in multiple posts, including deputy chancellor of the Texas A&M System and assistant director of Homeland Security for the Department of Public Safety.

Kimbrough, a former Marine and Vietnam War veteran, is currently employed with the Texas Health and Human Services Commission working on veterans' affairs.

HHSC spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman said Kimbrough focuses on treatment for traumatic brain injuries and mental illness, raising awareness that such services are available and looking at ways to hire more veterans.
