
Guam - In anticipation of one of the most high profile cases of the year, Superior Court officials are beginning preparations for the trial of accused murderer Chad DeSoto, a trial that is expected to last 6 to 8 weeks with over 100 potential witnesses, more than 20 of whom will be flown in from off-island.

"We’re looking that this trial will probably take about 6-8 weeks. I think now that the government had filed 138 potential witnesses, while the defense filed 30 potential witnesses ... I just want you to know I think it’ll take us about 2 weeks to select the jury, maybe less," says Judge Sukola.

Deputy Attorney General Phil Tydingco says the AG's office will narrow down its witness list but that number won't be finalized until the end of this week.

"We have locked them in to arrive on island. Dr. Blinder will be ready to testify on July 9, Dr. Fukataki on July 8," Miller says.

"I would say that as soon as we’re done selecting the jury, I would begin scheduling flying in the Japanese witnesses," Tydingco then stated.

In anticipation of a packed courtroom with international media presence, court officials also met with the local media. In the days following the Tumon Tragedy, Japanese media were cluttered at different posts around the island, some camping out in parking lots, others at the hospital’s lawn.

Court Spokesman Josh Tenorio says the Judiciary’s goal is to ensure accessibility without disruption of ongoing court proceedings. He notes that about 15 people from the Japanese media will be flying to Guam for Desoto's trial.

DeSoto is accused of driving his car in a crowded Tumon sidewalk, crashing into the Outrigger’s ABC Store then jumping out and stabbing people at random. DeSoto pleaded not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity.
