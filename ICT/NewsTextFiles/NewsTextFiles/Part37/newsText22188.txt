
When a recent episode of “Oishinbo,” a popular Japanese manga series , hit stands Monday it included a controversial panel featuring characters that suffer nose bleeds due to radiation caused by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant disaster of 2011. The cooking-themed comic book — which has now been suspended indefinitely — runs in Big Comic Spirits magazine and is authored by Tetsu Kariya, whose numerous visits to the plant compelled him to pen the story.

In this Monday’s issue, managing editor Hiroshi Murayama included an afterword where he claimed responsibility for the backlash the storyline and graphic artwork have received, but did not offer an apology. Instead, he announced that the manga’s publisher Shogakukan Inc. would conduct a policy review.
