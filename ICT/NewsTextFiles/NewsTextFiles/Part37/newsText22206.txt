
ENFIELD, Conn. (WGGB/AP) — Conn. officials have suspended the license of an Enfield dentist after the death of a patient who was having 20 teeth extracted.

Dr. Rashmi Patel, who has offices in Torrington and Enfield, faces a June 18 hearing before the Connecticut State Dental Commission.

The state alleges Patel’s actions on February 17 led to the death of a 64-year-old female patient.

A report indicates that the patient was in the office to have several teeth extracted, bone grafting, and implants put in when she became unresponsive.

After CPR was administered at the office, the woman was taken to Baystate Medical Center where she was pronounced dead.

Among other things, the state alleges Patel failed to respond appropriately when the woman’s oxygen levels dropped, and improperly attempted to extract the teeth in a single visit.
