
A Coromandel man plans to fight a charge of perjury after being accused of lying during a trial.

Frank Allan Yeates, 62, today pleaded not guilty to the charge via audio visual link in the Hamilton District Court and has elected a trial by jury.

The perjury charge stems from a trial in March this year when he's accused of providing false evidence to a jury.

Yeates was further remanded for another appearance via audio visual link next month.
