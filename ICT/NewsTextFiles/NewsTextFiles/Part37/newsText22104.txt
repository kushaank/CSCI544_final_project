
Japanese telecom company SoftBank Corp. ( SFTBF.PK , SFTBY.PK) Monday announced that its unit Yahoo Japan Corp has canceled its plans to acquire shares of mobile network operator eAccess Ltd., from SoftBank in a deal worth $3.2 billion, or 324 billion yen.

The company also cut its revenue estimate for the first half of fiscal year ending March 2015.

It was on March 27, 2014 that Yahoo! Japan announced its intention to purchase shares of eAccess from SoftBank. Following in-depth discussions, the board of directors of Yahoo! Japan has decided to cancel the purchase of eAccess shares and conversion to a consolidated subsidiary. Transfer of shares to Yahoo! Japan was scheduled to occur on June 2.

Yahoo! Japan is a Japanese internet company formed as a joint venture between U.S internet company Yahoo! Inc (YHOO) and the Japanese internet company SoftBank. SoftBank owns 42.6 percent of Yahoo! Japan.

eAccess and SoftBank's unit, Willcom, Inc., are still scheduled to merge with an effective date of June 1, 2014, and the new company's name will be changed to Y!mobile Corp.

Yahoo! Japan came to the conclusion that instead of its converting the new company to a consolidated subsidiary and building an infrastructure on its own, it would be better to develop the business by employing the strengths of each company. As a result, Yahoo! Japan will be responsible for services and the new company for infrastructure.

SoftBank noted that the impact of the cancellation of the deal on the consolidated results for fiscal year ending March 31, 2015 will be minor.

The company also cut its revenue estimate for the first half of fiscal year ending March 2015, to 211.90 billion yen from its previous forecast of 335.90 billion yen. For the first half of fiscal 2013, the company posted 188.04 billion yen.

The firm still expects operating income to be 93.40 billion yen for the period.

Yahoo! Japan said it would still pursue the "Y!mobile" service with SoftBank, whilst eAccess builds infrastructure.

In Tokyo, SoftBank shares closed today's trading at 6,766 yen, down 1.87 percent.
