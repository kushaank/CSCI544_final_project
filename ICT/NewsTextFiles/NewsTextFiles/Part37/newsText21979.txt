
From Rostov to Perm to Moscow to Orenberg, in cities both big and small, hundreds of students signed up for months of serious learning. In some cities it proved to be a dramatic revival.

Students were accomodated by Russian-language tours of the Coliseum, the leaning tower of Pisa and Venice’s gondolas, a tour of the old Jewish ghettos and historic synagogues. They met with local Italian Chabad shluchim and then traveled to Bratislava, Slovakia where they spent a grand Shabbat before going on to Poland’s concentration camps, Aushwitz and Birkenau. That too, resonated differently for the students as a result of the study program they participated in prior to the trip.
