
Jurors serving in state District Court in Las Cruces should be more comfortable this summer.

The Las Cruces Sun-NewsÂ reports that a contractor is on the home stretch of a three-month project to upgrade the nearly 9-year-old courthouse's antiquated heating and cooling system.

Chief Judge Fernnando Macias says he has worried during trials in the past that uneven temperatures in courtrooms would distract jurors.

Those uneven temperatures made some courtrooms too hot and others too cold.

Funding for the work was approved by the state Legislature in 2013.
