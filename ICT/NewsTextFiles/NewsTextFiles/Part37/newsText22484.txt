
New Delhi : Essar Group promoter Ravi Ruia, accused in 2G spectrum allocation scam, Monday told a special court hearing the case that he had not committed any wrongdoing.

Ruia told Central Bureau of Investigation court Special Judge O.P. Saini that some of the prosecution witnesses in the case might have been influenced by rival firms.

The court April 9 supplied a questionnaire containing 645 questions to Essar Group and Loop Telecom promoters who are among the accused. The questions are part of the statements of the accused being recorded.

Ruia said that many facts were not appreciated during the probe conducted by the CBI, and that Clause 8 of unified access service licence (UASL), which, according to CBI, was violated by the accused facing the trial, was misunderstood.

He said that he had no knowledge of the day-to-day functioning of Loop Telecom Ltd., which also has been booked in the case.

Recording of statements of Essar Group promoters Ravi Ruia and Anshuman Ruia, and Loop Telecom promoter Kiran Khaitan was concluded. The court will record the statements of other accused Tuesday.

A third set of charges filed by the CBI in the 2G case says that promoters of the Essar Group were the real investors and beneficiaries of the spectrum and licences issued to the Loop Telecom, which was used as a front company by Essar to acquire 2G licences and spectrum in 2008.

This has been denied by the Essar promoters.
