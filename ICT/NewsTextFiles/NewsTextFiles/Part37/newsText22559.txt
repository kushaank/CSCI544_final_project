
May 16 — Staffing losses and resource constraints in the Passthroughs and Special Industries division of the Internal Revenue Service's Office of Chief Counsel will likely result in a smaller priority list of passthroughs projects on the next business plan, a senior IRS official said.

Attorney staffing in the division has declined by about 15 percent in the past two years, and the Office of Chief Counsel as a whole has also shrunk, Curtis G. Wilson, IRS associate chief counsel (Passthroughs and Special Industries), said May 16 at a meeting of the American Institute of CPA's Partnership Taxation Technical Resource Panel. “We just don't have as many people to work on things,” he said.

“Just recently we've decided to rearrange the Passthroughs side of our division” due to the departure of several managers in the Special Industries branch and docket attorneys in the Passthroughs branch, Wilson said. The Passthroughs and Special Industries division takes up three of the seven branches in the Chief Counsel's Office.
