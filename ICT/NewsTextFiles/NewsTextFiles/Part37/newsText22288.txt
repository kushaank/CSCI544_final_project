
For three hours, the TWG discussed sub-clauses B and D of Section 7, which lists the exemptions to public access to information.

“Dapat sana di na naging issue kung anong version ng bill ang pag-uusapan dahil nalinaw na iyon noong mga nakaraang meeting. There were so many questions on small matters [during the discussion] kaya masyado kaming nagtagal,” Baguilat said.

Akbayan party-list Rep. Ibarra Gutierrez, who authored one of the FOI bills up for consolidation, said he had expected the prolonged discussions on Section 7, given the varied opinions lawmakers had on the kinds of information that can be revealed to the public.

“This has been one of the provisions that have been hotly debated even before [in the 15th Congress]. In a way, it is good progress that in today’s meeting, we were able to agree on the contentious provisions on executive privilege and exempting drafts from requests to information,” he said.

Almonte, however, insisted that it was necessary to devote more time to discussing the provisions in detail at each meeting, so that each TWG member can voice their opinions on the bill.
