
Fletcher Giddings said he wanted to enter a dog in the Wellington Show pet parade.

It wasn't his dog, actually nobody knows who owns it.

But when Hobo, a stray dropped by the show, Fletcher entered him and won the best in show.

The judges said he was a friendly dog and well behaved.

The crowd clapped when Hobo and Fletcher accepted their award.

Its not known if 'Hobo' has ever won an award but the judges weren't concerned at all.

The pet parade was popular with Labradors, sausage dogs and a miniature horse making up the field.

Meanwhile the cattle dog Hobo could be in a movie next with Fletcher about a mate and a famous dog.

Hobo is still unclaimed by his true owners.
