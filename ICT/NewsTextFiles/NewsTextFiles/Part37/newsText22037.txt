
Jordan Still, 17, will be showing off his magical skills in Truro to raise money for Cancer Research.

Jordan Still, 17, from Grampound, has spent four years polishing his considerable skills in close magic.

The Truro College student will be out in Truro on SaturdayMay24 to perform tricks for the public and raise money for Cancer Research.

Jordan plies his magical trade at weddings and functions and is hoping to become a professional magician in the future.

He said: “Generally I practice three or four hours a day just to get better and better. People’s reactions are amazing.

Jordan started to learn his first tricks when he was 13 years old.

The young magician took inspiration from star performers such as David Blaine. Seeing Dynamo in action prompted Jordan to get back into practice after he stopped doing magic for a while.

Some of the tricks can be learned from books but Jordan has also been able to learn some routines just from watching senior magicians at work.

Despite the teenager’s in-depth knowledge of the skills involved, he can still be stunned by what fellow practitioners can do.

Jordan will be out in Truro with friend Josh Hitchings who will film as the tricks unfold.

Jordan was prompted to raise funds for Cancer Research as his grandmother Jean Still died from the disease in 2003. He initially aimed to raise £100 but that target was smashed after two days of having a collection box on the bar at his parents’ pub, The Dolphin.
