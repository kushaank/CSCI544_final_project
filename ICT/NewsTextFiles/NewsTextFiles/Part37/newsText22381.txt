
Winston Jerricho Cudjoe appeared in the Siparia Magistrates' Court today charged with manslaughter, in the death of his 17-month-old grandson Jaedon Cudjoe.

Baby Jaedon was found dead in the back seat of Cudjoe's car parked on the compound of his workplace at Petrotrin's Clarke Road, Penal facility last week Tuesday.

Police said that the child was forgotten in the vehicle for more than eight hours, and an autopsy found that he died from hyperthermia due to the extreme heat.

Cudjoe, 56, of Penal Rock Road, had been in police custody since discovering the infant, but released last Friday night after being grated $200,000 bail, shortly after he was charged on the instructions of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. He attended Baby Jaedon's funeral the following day.

Today, Cudjoe appeared before Siparia Magistrate Joanne Connor where the manslaughter charge was read. In court were Cudjoe's son, Fergus, and daughter-in-law Masika, the parents of baby Jaedon.

Cudjoe, an electrical supervisor with Petrotrin, was allowed to continue on bail. The case was adjourned to June 15. The court was told that a State attorney will be appointed to prosecute Cudjoe.
