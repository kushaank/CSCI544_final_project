
Justice Neal Hendel says Katsav's claims that he suffered a "distortion of justice" are baseless.

After previously rejecting all appeals by former president Moshe Katsav on his 2010 conviction for rape , the Supreme Court on Monday also rejected his newest  request – a request for a retrial.

Katsav has been serving a seven year  sentence in Ma’asiyahu prison in Ramle since December 2011.

In his  decision, Justice Neal Hendel wrote that the complainant’s testimony about  Katsav raping her was credible, whereas the former president’s testimony was  not.

“The fact that it could not be determined with absolute certainty  the exact time that the rape occurred does not in and of itself raise a  reasonable doubt and definitely does not represent a distortion of justice that  justifies a retrial,” Hendel said.

Had Katsav won any of his appeals to a  wider panel of justices, he could have been acquitted based on the  already-conducted trial.

The current motion, filed on October 14, 2013,  would have required a complete retrying of the evidence, and was thus, an even  more desperate move to find some way to get out of prison.

Katsav was  convicted of two counts of rape, one count of committing an indecent act using  force, one count of committing an indecent act, two counts of sexual harassment,  one count of harassing a witness and one count of obstructing justice.
