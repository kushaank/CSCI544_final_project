
AUSTIN, TX - University of Texas System Regent Wallace Hall has told the Board of Regents chairman that he won't resign despite the chairman's call for him to step down.

Hall attorney Allan Van Fleet says Hall sent a letter to Board Chairman Paul Foster informing that Hall would remain on the job.

Foster has urged Hall to resign amid legislative and criminal investigations into Hall's actions probing the University of Texas in an effort to force UT President Bill Powers out.

A Texas House panel last week found grounds exist to impeach Hall, which could lead to his removal from office. The panel is to vote on articles of impeachment on Wednesday.

Gov. Rick Perry appointed Hall in 2011, and Perry aides say Hall still has the governor's support.
