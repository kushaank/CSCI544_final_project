
TELUK INTAN: It will be a straight fight between a political novice and a seasoned politician in the Teluk Intan parliamentary by-election on May 31.

The by-election will see 27-year-old Dyana Sofya Mohd Daud of the DAP,  take on Datuk Mah Siew Keong, 53, of BN for the ballots of the 60,000 odd voters in the constituency which comprises 23,301 Malays,  25,310 Chinese, 11,468 Indians and 270 others.

The seat fell vacant following the death of incumbent MP Seah Leong Peng, 48, of the DAP of cancer on May 1.

The straight fight was announced by returning officer Datuk Ibrahim Ahmad at the nomination centre at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Seri Perak in Jalan Changkat Jong here at 10am today.

Mah, who is Gerakan president, and Dyana, who is political secretary to DAP adviser Lim Kit Siang,  then shook hands and congratulated each other.

The talking point among supporters of both sides, however, was when Lim walked over to the BN side and shook hands and joked with Deputy Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin and BN supporters who had accompanied Mah to the nomination centre earlier at 8.45am.

Mah did not say much to reporters but condemned personal attacks carried out by certain quarters against Dyana.

Dyana, wearing a green baju kurung, was accompanied by her parents Mohd Daud Ismail and Yammy Samat, when she arrived at 8.55am. Also accompanying her were Lim, PAS deputy president Mohamad Sabu and PKR deputy president Azmin Ali.

Dyanaâ€™s mother, Yammy, an Umno and ex-Semangat 46 member, thanked the Pakatan Rakyat for giving her daughter the opportunity to represent the Opposition coalition.
