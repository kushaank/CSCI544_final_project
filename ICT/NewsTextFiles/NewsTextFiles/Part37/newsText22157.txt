
Tokyo has reportedly made plans to create new military outposts on remote islands close to disputed territories in an apparent move to bolster Japanâ€™s defense capabilities amid its ongoing territorial rows with China.

Some 350 Ground Self-Defense Forces could be stationed on the   three islands near the disputed islands, known as Diaoyu in China   and as Senkaku in Japan, Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun cited   unnamed senior Japanese Ministry of Defense officials as saying.

The three uninhabited, disputed islets lie some 2,000 km   southwest of Tokyo, and around 200 km north of Taiwan.

According to the report, Tokyo will be establishing three bases   close to the strategic location â€“ a base on Amami Oshima Island,   Miyako Island (210 km southwest of the disputed islands), and   Ishigaki Island (about 170 km south), each staffed by up to 150   soldiers.

Last month, Japan announced it was building a high-tech radar   outpost on Yonaguni Island, due to become operational in 2016.

The current absence of military troops close to the strategic   islands has caused some concern to Japan, which believes it is   making itself vulnerable in the face of an increasingly   domineering Chinese approach.

While there has not yet been much grist of military   confrontation, being largely confined to coastguard squabbles,   close watchers have stated that some naval ships have been   lurking beyond the horizon and suggest that further confrontation   may be on the cards. Additionally, China has increased spending   on its military in recent years, allegedly to develop a two-tier   blue water navy â€“ one capable of operating across the deep waters   of open oceans, implicitly the Pacific.

In its territorial dispute with China, Japan was supported by US   President Barack Obama last month.

â€œThe policy of the United States is clear - the Senkaku   islands are administered by Japan and therefore fall within the   scope of...the US-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and   Security,â€� Obama said during his visit to Japan in April.

That's provocative. This move by the Japanese simply escalates the situation. You're getting us into war by forward momentum. We won't have it.

I suggest that Japan simply return administration of the Senkakus to the US. In addition, the US should/will garrison US marines on the islands, thus stopping any consideration of an invasion by China, until sovereignty of these islands is adjudicated by an international body. At the very worst, if Japan is not accorded sovereignty, the Senkakus would be assigned to Taiwan, not the PRC.
