
The owner of some Lexington Subway restaurants reportedly reached a tentative plea deal over harboring charges.

The Lexington Herald Leader said federal court documents showed that Amrutlal Patel had asked for a motion to plead guilty.

Patel and his wife were arrested in November of 2013.

They were charged with harboring and employing illegal workers.

The couple owns four Subway restaurants in Lexington.

The Herald Leader said Patel's attorney confirmed that a tentative deal was reached but would not go into the details.

The lawyer representing his wife reportedly told the paper that Mrs. Patel was close to a tentative agreement in the case against her.
