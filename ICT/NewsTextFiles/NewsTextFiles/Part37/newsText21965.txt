
PRINCE Harry spoke wistfully of marriage yesterday and the romance of proposing to one’s girlfriend in Paris.

His comments came amid claims he and former girlfriend Cressida Bonas could be getting back together, just over three weeks since they broke up.

Although at times Harry seemed to be thinking about his own situation, he was actually talking about a couple he met at Italy’s Monte Cassino abbey and who he invited to get married in London.

He was introduced to Italian airforce Colonel Marco Iannuzzi, 36, and his fiancee Anna Lucia Fedullo, 27.

The colonel, who will co-ordinate Italy’s team at the Invictus Games for wounded troops in London in September, told how he crash-landed in a field in 2000 and broke his spine. He now has to walk with a stick.

Harry said: “I suppose that is something that you thought you would never do.

He then asked the colonel’s fiancee: “Is he very romantic?”.

Harry, 29, has said he would like to marry if he could find the right woman and persuade her to take on the baggage that goes with being a royal bride.But there is little sign so far of him getting back together with Cressida, 25.

Despite claims the pair met last week and Harry was keen to resurrect the romance, sources close to both said they had “no knowledge” of any possible reconciliation.

But one thing is for sure, Harry is never without admirers for long.

He won over another one yesterday. Colonel Monica Contratta of Italy’s Fusiliers, another athlete lining up for the Invictus Games, told Harry she lost a leg in Afghanistan in 2012 under mortar fire.
