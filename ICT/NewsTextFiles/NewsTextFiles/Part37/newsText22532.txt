
SINGAPORE — Nearly 30 years after she was charged with the murder of her young son, a woman diagnosed with schizophrenia was today (May 19) acquitted by the High Court.

The acquittal came after the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) recommended that Yeo Khee Cheng, alias Ng Puay Hong, be granted an unconditional discharge for the murder of Ng Chin Sing, the youngest of her four children, in November 1984.

The prosecution applied to the High Court for a discharge amounting to an acquittal after considering the facts and circumstances of Yeo’s case, a spokesperson from the Attorney-General’s Chambers said today.

Yeo, now 60, was accused of throwing her son, then 6, from a block of flats in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1. She was assessed to be suffering from chronic schizophrenia and unfit to plead but later, in 1985, the visitor’s board of the then-Woodbridge Hospital reported her to be capable of making her defence.

Before her trial could begin in 1994, however, she was again assessed to be unfit to plead.

Yeo was confined to Changi Women’s Prison and subsequently transferred to Woodbridge Hospital, which is today called the IMH. She has been under the institute’s care and treatment.
