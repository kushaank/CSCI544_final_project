
The Supreme Court on Monday granted three weeks’ interim bail to former Tehelka magazine editor Tarun Tejpal to enable him to attend the last rites of his mother, who passed away on Sunday. Tejpal is currently lodged at Sada sub-jail in Goa’s Vasco town in connection with a sexual assault case.

A Bench of Justices B S Chauhan and A K Sikri ordered Tejpal’s release after an in-chamber hearing. Senior advocate U U Lalit mentioned the matter for an urgent hearing before the court and sought an interim relief in view of the death of Tejpal’s mother, Shakuntala Tejpal, in Goa from cancer. Lalit told the Bench that the cremation was to take place on Monday evening and hence the matter should be decided on an urgent basis.

The Bench then asked Tejpal’s legal team to inform the counsel of Goa Police to attend the hearing since the order, the court said, should be passed in everyone’s presence.

Tejpal (50) has been chargesheeted for allegedly raping, sexually harassing and outraging the modesty of a junior colleague during an event held at a hotel in Goa in November last year.

Tejpal was arrested on November 30, 2013.
