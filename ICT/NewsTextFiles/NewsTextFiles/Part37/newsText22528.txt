â€œThe devastating effects of climate change are all around us right now, and it is time for Congress to wake up. We must sound the alarm and act now to reduce carbon pollution for the sake of our health, our economy and the well-being of our children and grandchildren," Boxer and Whitehouse said in a statement on Monday.

Speakers will include members of the Senate Climate Action Task Force, the Bicameral Climate Change Task Force, the House Safe Climate Caucus, the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, and House and Senate leadership.
