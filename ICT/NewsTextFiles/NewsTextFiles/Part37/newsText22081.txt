Launched in 2007, Sansan’s unique cloud based contact management service        empowers business organizations to better leverage their relationships        and network. Sansan’s unique technology rapidly and accurately        transcribes business cards, and uploads them into a cloud-based contact        management platform. Furthermore, going beyond traditional contact        management, Sansan enables seamless collaboration around critical        business data – who met whom, when, where and why.
