
A man who kicked his estranged wife then allegedly threatened to used a knife on her because she told him she no longer had feelings for him was sentenced to 10 days' imprisonment.

On Friday, when the matter was called up in the Corporate Area Resident Magistrate's Court, Andrew Walker pleaded guilty to assaulting his wife. However, he denied pulling a knife and threatening to use it on her.

The court later withdrew the assault at common-law charge.

Allegations are that the complainant told Walker that her feelings for him was gone and he kicked her on her foot, causing pain.

Reports are that he also threw away her house key during the argument.

Resident Magistrate Opal Smith subsequently sentenced Walker to 10 days.

He was later handcuffed and taken away from the courtroom and a fingerprint order made.
