Radical Muslim preacher Abu Hamza has been found guilty of all terror charges at his trial in New York.

The jury of eight men and four women found the 56-year-old guilty of 11 offences, including kidnapping 16 tourists in Yemen in 1998.

Among them was Kiwi Mary Quin, who interviewed Hamza after her ordeal andÂ  gave evidence at his trial earlier this month.

Hamza, also known as Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, maintains he never helped al-Qaeda or other militant groups. But when asked by Ms Quin whether he had provided her kidnappers with a satellite phone he told her "yes, perhaps".

During the trial, Hamza admitted supplying a satellite to the Islamist group that kidnapped the Western tourists in Yemen, but said he was only told of the abduction after the fact.

Ms Quin said Hamza told her that the chief kidnapper, Abu Hasan, called him during the kidnapping and that he advised him to stay back to avoid being killed during the Yemen army's rescue operation.

In interview transcripts, Hamza told Ms Quin he thought kidnapping foreigners was a good thing to do, as he wanted the tourism industry to stop fuelling anti-Islamic industries like gambling and drinking alcohol.

The jury deliberated for 12 hours over two days after the four-week trial. Hamza showed no reaction as the verdicts were read.

The prosecutor in the case, Preet Bharara, has welcomed the unanimous guilty verdict against a man he called "a trainer of terrorists".

"These trials demonstrate that in an American civilian courtroom, the American people and all the victims of terrorism can be vindicated without sacrificing our principles," Mr Bharara said in a statement.

He lived in the UK and was indicted in the US in 2004, before losing his appeal against extradition in 2012. He will be sentenced on September 9 and could face life in prison.
