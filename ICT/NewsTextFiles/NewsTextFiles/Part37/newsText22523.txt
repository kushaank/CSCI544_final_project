
KARACHI: An anti-terrorism court on Saturday ordered the release of a suspect in the Tahir Plaza arson attack case for want of evidence against him.

Abdul Qadir was booked for his alleged involvement in the Tahir Plaza incident in which a lawyer and his five clients were burnt to death when the building was set on fire on April 9, 2008.

Police submitted that he was arrested in other cases and disclosed his involvement in the present case during interrogations by a joint investigation team.

The investigating officer submitted a report in the anti-terrorism court-III, stating that an eyewitness had failed to pick out the suspect during an identification parade before a judicial magistrate while no concrete evidence was found to connect him with the case.
