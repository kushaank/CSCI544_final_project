
A hearing to decide if the ACT Government's annual kangaroo cull should go ahead will be held in Canberra today.

The cull of more than 1,600 eastern grey kangaroos in eight nature reserves was set to start last week and continue until August.

ACAT ordered the cull be postponed at least until today when a hearing begins into whether or not the group has a case.

It is the second challenge the group has lodged.

Last year a similar challenge by Animal Liberation was largely rejected, though the target number of animals killed was reduced.
