
Amman, May 18 (Petra) –– His Royal Highness Prince Faisal Ibn al Hussein, the regent, on Sunday received directors of various branches of Caritas Foundation International, currently holding a regional meeting in Amman.

The prince said during the Royal Court meeting that Jordan is working in partnership with all global agencies and organisations to counter crises imposed on regional countries, namely the Syrian conflict, whose repercussions pose a huge challenge to Middle Eastern countries and peoples.

He was referring to the burdens Jordan had been grappling with as a result of accommodating Syrian refugees and providing humanitarian relief to them, putting enormous strains on its meagre resources, particularly local communities that are suffering as a result.

The regent commended the Catholic charity's assistance to refugees through its Caritas Jordan branch and its efforts in achieving development locally and serving the society, stressing a collective effort by all stakeholders in this endeavour.

The Caritas delegates said they appreciated Jordan's services to Syrian refugees and its efforts to improve these even further. He also noted His Majesty King Abdullah's role in trying to bring about regional peace and security and spread the values of tolerance and fraternity.

Caritas Jordan is a member of the Rome-based International Caritas Confederation, a key global organisation that offers humanitarian service through 165 charities working in 200 countries around the world.
