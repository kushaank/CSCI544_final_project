
Deutsche Bank hopes that raising €8bn in new capital from investors will strengthen its finances as it faces tighter regulation and uncertain costs from litigation.

The joint CEO Anshu Jain told analysts on Monday that the fresh capital would also help it meet "unforeseen challenges". Jain said it was impossible to quantify the additional demands that watchdogs might place on banks as regulatory efforts continued.

The chief financial officer, Stefan Krause, said the bank also faced a "challenging and unpredictable litigation environment" even after setting aside billions of euros for fines and lawsuits.

The capital increase comes as banks across Europe have been shedding risky investments and raising new financial buffers to meet new regulatory standards aimed at strengthening the banking system. The European Central Bank is conducting a detailed review of large banks' finances and holdings as it prepares to take over as the European Union 's centralised banking supervisor in November.

The bank said on Sunday it would raise €6.3bn via a rights offering in which investors are asked to put up more money, and that it had already secured €1.75bn by placing shares with Paramount Holdings Services, an investment vehicle owned by Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabor al-Thani of Qatar.

The move will raise the bank's capital ratio, a key measure of financial strength, to 11.8%, well beyond the bank's 10% goal.
