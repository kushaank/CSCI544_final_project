
BALTIMORE — A Baltimore-area gynecologist charged with illegally distributing powerful painkillers to patients is expected to plead guilty to federal charges.

An attorney for Dr. John Yacoub said Monday she anticipates her client will plead guilty May 28 to a single charge of drug possession and distribution.

Yacoub had practiced gynecology and obstetrics for 30 years before surrendering his medical license in November.

Court documents say Yacoub distributed morphine, oxycodone, methadone and fentanyl, among other substances.
