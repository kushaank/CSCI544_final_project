
It is unclear exactly who is behind these high-budget films, which are broadcast on online TV stations with hardliner tendencies. There have been about a dozen produced so far, varying in quality; in most of them, Israel has attacked Iran but is now on the verge of complete invasion or annihilation by Iran. However, those with knowledge of Iran’s film world have some theories.

it is so stupid that the media try again and again to demonise Iran against the Jews. In Iran, the major jew community of the middle east lives since thousands of years.

Reminder to all: it was Darioush the Great, king of Persia, that freed the jewish slaves of Egipt.
