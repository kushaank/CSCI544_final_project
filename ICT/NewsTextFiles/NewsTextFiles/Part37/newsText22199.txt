
Nairobi, Kenya: Moses Gift Osinya, brother of baby Satrin Osinya whose story touched the nation, was presented with the Jubilee Insurance award Thursday for his bravery in rescuing his brother during the Likoni church terror attack.

The 13-year-old carried his injured brother from the scene and took him to nearest hospital using a rickshaw (Tuk tuk).

“I am grateful that Jubilee Insurance has recognised my efforts to save my brother. I thank God Satrin is fully recovered and I consider him my hero for conquering the bullet,” said the Standard Seven pupil at Bethlehem Academy in Ruiru.

“I am proud of my son for his courage to save his little brother. It is because of him that we still have Satrin with us,” said his father Benson Osinya.

The judges described his selfless deed as admirable especially for his age. Gift was named alongside Mzee Job Kipkoech, a Mogotio resident who has helped tortoises cross the busy Mogotio-Marigat road for the last 56 years. His aim is to make sure that no tortoise crossing the road everyday in search of water on one side and vegetation on the other is crushed by vehicles plying the busy road.

While applauding the 76-year-old, Kenya Wildlife Service Deputy Director Benjamin Kavu urged all Kenyans to emulate his actions.

Mogotio is highly populated with the leopard tortoise, the hunchback tortoise and the endangered pancake tortoise species.
