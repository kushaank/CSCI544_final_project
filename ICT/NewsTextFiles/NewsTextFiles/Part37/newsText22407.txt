
For the second time in a month, a lawyer for the directors of a failed bank argued before the Georgia Supreme Court Monday why they should not be held personally liable for negligence.

Integrity Bank of Alpharetta closed in August 2008, an early casualty of a wave of bank failures across the country in the wake of what became known as the Great Recession. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), which was named as the bankâ€™s receiver, subsequently filed a lawsuit accusing eight of its former directors â€“ including state Sen. Jack Murphy , R-Cumming, then chairman of the Senate Banking Committee â€“ of causing $70 million in losses by negligently approving 21 loans.

On Monday, Robert Ambler Jr., representing the former directors, argued that a business judgment rule in Georgia law prohibits corporate officers â€“ including those in charge of banks â€“ from being held liable for ordinary negligence arising from business decisions made in good faith. According to the rule, only gross negligence, fraud or malfeasance should be grounds for liability, he said.

â€œ[The business judgment rule] is a court-made doctrine recognized throughout the United States ... recognized in decisions of this court and by the General Assembly,â€� he said.

But Scott Watson , the FDICâ€™s lawyer, said state law requires bank officers to exercise both good faith and â€œordinary careâ€� in their business decisions. Otherwise, they can be found liable for ordinary negligence, he said.
