
Some Kentucky military veteran farmers say they will plant a crop of hemp seeds this week following a federal court hearing.

The Kentucky Agriculture Department had sued the Drug Enforcement Agency over the agency's seizure of hemp seeds imported for research. A judge ruled that the seeds can be released with the proper permits.

Rockcastle County farmer Michael Lewis says he'll apply for a permit and get planting soon. “I have to fill out an application process and go before the judge and fill out the paperwork, and once the paperwork is approved, we’ll plant hemp. Universities are free and clear to plant hemp," said Lewis.

Farmers had planned to plant the seeds last week, but the event was delayed due to the seizure and lawsuit.
