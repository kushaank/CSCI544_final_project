
Oregon's gay marriage ban on Monday was ruled unconstitutional by U.S. District Court Judge Michael McShane.

The case was brought on behalf of four same-sex couples. Some county clerks were expected to begin handing out gay marriage licenses shortly after the ruling.

Oregon approved a gay marriage ban in the state constitution by referendum in 2004 with 57 percent of the vote.

Seventeen states, aside from Oregon and the District of Columbia, allow same-sex marriage. Judges in seven other states have stuck down their state's gay marriage ban, but those decisions are temporarily delayed pending appeal.

The spate of rulings in the past year have come after the Supreme Court struck down a portion of the Defense of Marriage Act that defined marriage as being between a man and a woman.
