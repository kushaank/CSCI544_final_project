The armed assault on the parliament has been called a "coup" by Libyan authorities.

The European Union is "deeply concerned" about "the significant deterioration of the situation, both politically and security-wise", said Michael Mann pokesperson to Catherine Ashton, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy for the European Union in a statement and  "deplored the loss of lives in Benghazi and Tripoli" but the EU did not take a stance on the the parliament attack, limiting itself to "appeal to all parties to stop the bloodshed and avoid further violence" and  "work together together to reach a stable democracy".

In a situation that European diplomatic sources define as "chaotic " and in which Prime Minister is "not completely legitimate", the EU, however, " underlines its commitment to support the Libyan people to complete the democratic transition in progress", said Mann.

Saudi Arabia has meanwhile closed its embassy in Tripoli, Libya, and evacuated diplomatic staff due to the deteriorating security situation in the country, reported Al Arabiya online.
