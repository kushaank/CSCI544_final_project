
One of the reasons for the multiple social problems Pakistan faces is the complete disregard for provisions laid down in the constitution, and intended to protect us from just the kind of disarray we face. As a three-member bench of the Supreme Court, headed by Chief Justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani noted while hearing last Tuesday the suo-motu case concerning the bomb blasts targeting a church in Peshawar that killed 80 people last year, articles 20 and 22 of the constitution lay down provisions for the protection of places of worship belonging to all religious groups, but are frequently ignored. The court, which was informed by representatives of the Hindu community about six separate attacks on its places of worship in March this year, sought a report from the IG Sindh on this and from the IG Punjab on the non-registration of marriages. Justice Jillani also noted that the blasphemy law applied to blasphemy against all religions, but was not interpreted as such. In light of the situation, the court appointed three advocates as amicus curie to assist it and offer advice on how to better protect the minorities of the country. Representatives of the minority communities were also asked to come up with suggestions.
