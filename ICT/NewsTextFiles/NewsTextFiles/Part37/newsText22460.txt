
A Connecticut judge has blasted the 22-year-old Quinnipiac University student accused of calling in two bomb threats to her college's graduation ceremony and set her bail at $10,000.

Judge Philip A. Scarpellino said Danielle Shea caused panic for thousands for 'very, very selfish, minimal reasons' reasons.

'I'm understanding that the whole year was a lie,' the furious judge told Shea, according to the Hartford Courant .

Authorities say Shea can't account for the money that her mother gave her.

According to police, Shea made two calls to the university's public safety department. In the first, about 20 minutes before the start of the 6 p.m. graduation ceremony, she stated there was a 'bomb in the library,' said police.

Hamden and university police identified Shea using the telephone number she'd called from and then found her at the arena.

She was wearing her graduation cap and gown, which she had apparently bought to keep up the ruse with her family.

In court on Monday, she was still wearing a floral blue and white dress that she had on under her gown.

She has been charged with first degree threatening and falsely reporting an incident.

University spokesman John Morgan said 388 students were part of the commencement ceremony for the College of Arts and Sciences. It was delayed 90 minutes due to the threats.

Two earlier ceremonies were held at 9 a.m. and 2 p.m.
