
It has been more than three years since the Syrian uprising began and has gone from being a nonviolent revolution to one of the bloodiest and most tragic conflicts the Middle East has known in modern times. As the war between the Syrian government forces and the Syrian opposition continues, the refugee situation worsens daily, military measures become even more extreme, and the most precious jewels of Syrian culture and history are daily being reduced to rubble.

This is a service-learning course that brings students face-to-face with the refugee situation and the realities of the conflict on the ground. In partnership with  Project Amal ou Salam , students complete several days of service work over the course of the trip. Although service locations are subject to change, past locations have included Syrian refugee schools in Istanbul and southern Turkey; orphanages and a rehabilitation center in southern Turkey; and a refugee camp.

We will additionally address the critical nonviolent stage of the revolution and what was missing to make it successful. We will address the general history of nonviolent resistance and social movements and the fate of nonviolence in the Syrian struggle. We will also look at the effect of outside actors and geopolitics on the direction of these movements.
