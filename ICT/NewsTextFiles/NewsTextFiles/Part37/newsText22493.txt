
An Iowa father has dropped his challenge to an informal Saydel Community School District policy that barred his 15-year-old, eighth-grade son from driving to school.

Robert Stephenson said that because he had to hire an attorney, he decided to drop the matter. He says his son will become a ninth-grader and be eligible for a school district permit when the school year ends on May 27.

On May 9 a judge said Stephenson had to hire a lawyer because Iowa law generally bars parents who are not attorneys from acting as advocates for their children in court.

Iowa law says a student must be 14½ to get a school permit. But the law also lets districts to set their own rules on permits.
