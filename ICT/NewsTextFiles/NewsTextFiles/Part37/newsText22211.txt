
Before her federal judge appointment Diane Humetewa taught law at Arizona State University. She was also the first Native American woman U.S. Attorney.

For the first time in the history of this country, a Native American woman has taken the oath to become a federal judge . She will be the only American Indian to serve on the federal bench out of almost 900 judges.

Diane Humetewa has come a long way from the remote Hopi reservation in northern Arizona. When she grew up, there was no electricity and only one faucet in her village.

Humetewa, who is almost 50, will be the first Native American federal judge in Arizona where there are 22 tribes and a quarter of the land is tribally owned.

Many have been pushing President Barack Obama to nominate a Native American judge because of the large number of Indian cases and the lack of tribal court knowledge.

Rebecca Tsosie is a regents professor at Arizona State University and has known Humetewa since she was in law school. Tsosie says the federal bench should represent who we are as a nation.

Tsosie said if there was a case about the first amendment you would expect a judge to have knowledge of constitutional law. The same goes for a tribal court case. But federal Indian law is not a course commonly taught in law schools.

Humetewa has practiced law as a U.S. attorney and as an appellate judge in Hopi tribal court. Tsosie said Humetewa transcends the politics of diversity.

Since the nomination Humetewa has received dozens of letters of support from strangers all over Indian Country. Many say she is a role model for young Native Americans. It’s an endorsement that Humetewa has taken seriously.

The U.S. Senate approved six Arizona federal judges last week. Humetewa’s confirmation was unanimous.
