
A man who slapped a woman in her face because she was calling his babymother names was sentenced to 10 days imprisonment last Friday in the Corporate Area Resident Magistrate's Court.

Charged with assault is Shamari Bailey who pleaded guilty to the offence.

The court was told that Bailey used indecent language to the complainant, then slapped her in her face causing pain.

Bailey told Resident Magistrate Opal Brown, "Your Honour, a because she call mi babymother names... she cut her already and mi never did ago mek it happen again."

He was then imprisoned for 10 days to reflect on his actions.
