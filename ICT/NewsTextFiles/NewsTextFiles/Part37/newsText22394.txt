Leonard Barstein, 25, a hospital technician from Brooklyn, was partying with friends at the cowboy-themed Johnny Utah’s on W. 51st Street in February when he mounted the electronic beast for what he thought would be a joy ride.

He landed in an un-padded area, fracturing his ankle in multiple places, according to his Manhattan civil suit.

“My leg is constantly swelling up,” Barstein said.

He had surgery and now struggles to walk, even with the help of a metal plate that was inserted into his leg.

“This is a very dangerous bull,” said Barstein’s attorney, Alexander Karasik, noting the infamous mechanical bronco’s history of roughing up riders.

Christopher Haynes, who fractured his knee after a brief ride, also sued the watering hole in 2011 and his case is still pending.

Two other suits ended with one victim mediating the dispute out of court and another losing his case because a judge didn’t buy his claim that he was drunk when he signed a release.

A rep for Johnny Utah’s did not return a message seeking comment.

The Yankees are leading the Angels 6-5 in the ninth, but Mariano Rivera blows the save. Leave it to Jeter, who hits a walk-off single in the ninth inning for a 7-6 Yankees win.
