Mr.V.K.Mathur for the respondents.

11 SCC 742).

wholly misplaced. To buttress his arguments, he has placed  reliance on the decisions of this Court rendered in Himanshu  Kachhwaha (supra) and Bhuvnashwar Singh (supra).       We have traversed the pleaded facts and examined as well  the documents available. We have also analyzed the arguments  advanced.

Admittedly, the on-going process is governed by the  provisions of the Rules. The relevant excerpt      of Rule 10 which  prescribes   reservation   of   vacancies   for   Scheduled   Castes,  Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes, Persons with Disabilities  and Women candidates is extracted hereinbelow:-         "(4) Reservation of posts for Persons with Disabilities as      defined in the Rajasthan Employment of Disabled Persons      Rules, 2000,

shall be 3% category-wise which shall be horizontal and shall      be available only at the time of initial recruitment. In the      event of non availability of eligible and suitable persons with      disabilities in a particular year, the vacancy so reserved for      them shall be filed in accordance with the normal procedure      and such vacancies shall not be carried forward to the      subsequent year."

preliminary and main examination as per the scheme set out in  Schedule-IV, sub-rule (2) thereof enjoins as hereunder:-         "(2) The number of candidates to be admitted to the main      examination will be fifteen times the total number of      vacancies (Category wise) to be filled in the year but in the      said range all those candidates who secure the same      percentage of marks as may be fixed by the Recruiting      Authority for any lower range will be admitted to the Main      Examination."

The stipulation corresponding to the above text appearing in the  advertisement is a replica thereof.

reservation whereas reservations in favour of physically       handicapped (under clause (1) of Art.16) can be referred to       as horizontal reservation. Horizontal reservations cut across       the   vertical   reservations-   what is   called   interlocking       reservations. To be more precise, suppose 3% of the       vacancies are reserved in favour of physically handicapped       persons; this would be a reservation relatable to clause (1)       of Article16. The persons selected against this quota will be       placed in the appropriate category, if he belongs to SC       category he will be placed in that quota by making necessary       adjustments, similarly, if he belongs to open competition       (OC) category, he will be placed in that category by making       necessary adjustments. Even after providing for these       horizontal reservations, the percentage of reservations in       favour of backward class of citizens remains- and should       remain- the same. This is how these reservations are worked out in several States and there is no reason not to continue       that procedure."

wise) to be filled in the year concerned were to be admitted to the  main examination, it was not so done for the physically  handicapped persons. The challenge based on this cavil was  negated relying on the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court rendered  in Indra Sawhney (supra). The observation of the Coordinate Bench  of this Court in Bhuvnashwar Singh (supra) to that effect that law  does not permit that there should be a separate category for  physically handicapped persons for the purpose of reservations,  was also relied upon. The decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in  Chattar Singh (supra) was distinguished. This rendition in Himanshu  Kachhwaha (supra) was upheld in D.B.Civil Special Appeal  No.445/2004 (decided on 16.8.2011) drawing sustenance therefor  amongst others   from the verdicts in Indra Sawhney (supra) and  Bhuvnashwar Singh (supra).

In Bhuvnashwar Singh (supra) the plea of the appellant  therein that the respondent-Commission was required to draw up  a separate category list for physically handicapped candidates as in  the case of reservations for SC, ST and OBC candidates with  reference to Article 16(4) was dismissed again principally relying  on the verdict of the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court  in Indra Sawhney (supra).

Combined Competitive Examinations) Rules, 1962, apart from  challenging the vires of Rule 13 thereof, a contention was raised  that there was a need to prepare separate list for various  categories for which the recruitment was underway. Taking note of  the amendment in the Rules, their Lordships of the Hon'ble Apex  Court expressed their view that separate lists were required to be  published in respect of candidates in the respective categories so  as to make up the number of candidates 15 times the notified or  anticipated posts/vacancies so as to enable them to appear in the  main examination. Not only as the contextual facts would disclose  that the cardinal aspect of dissidence was relatable to the  requirement of prescribing lesser cut-off marks for the OBC  category candidates, noticeably, the decision of the Constitution  Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Indra Sawhney (supra) did not  figure in course of the adjudication, more particularly qua the  physically handicapped candidates. This decision, therefore, in our  comprehension, does not advance the case of the petitioner in the  context of the issue presently involved.

that cut-off marks for women candidates, who similarly are to avail  horizontal reservation, have been declared and that omission to do  so vis-a-vis the physically handicapped candidates is in apparent  violation of the Rules besides being constitutionally impermissible,  does not weigh with us, in view of the emphatic and unequivocal  exposition in Indra Sawhney (supra) distinguishing         vertical and  horizontal reservations in the context of the constitutional scheme  therefor as enshrined in Article 16 of the Constitution and the  consequential adjustments of those availing horizontal reservations  in the respective categories i.e. General/SC/ST/OBC. We find no  discernible reason whatsoever to sustain the challenge as laid in  the instant petition.
