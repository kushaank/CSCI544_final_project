
Former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell and his wife Maureen will find out Tuesday whether they will be granted separate trials in their ongoing corruption cases.

U.S. District Judge James Spencer also denied the former first couple's request for separate trials.

Defense attorneys said Maureen will likely testify, if the McDonnells are granted separate trials. Prosecutors oppose separating the cases.

McDonnell and his wife face more than a dozen charges for accepting more than $165,000 from former Star Scientific CEO Jonnie Williams in exchange for help promoting the company's products.

The McDonnells deny any wrongdoing. They are scheduled to go on trial July 28.
