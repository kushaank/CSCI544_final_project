
A MAN was trapped in the back of a car and attacked with a claw hammer, a court has heard.

Foaga Fuimaono, 26, is standing trial at the Ipswich District Court for armed assault occasioning bodily harm. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Crown prosecutor Matthew Le Grand alleged that on June 4, 2013, Fuimaono attacked a man after hearing a rumour the man was in a relationship with his girlfriend.

After inviting the man to sit in the back seat of a white Subaru, the Crown alleges Fuimaono got two people to repeat the rumour they'd heard before repeatedly hitting the man with a hammer to the head. The man suffered injuries to his head and his hands.

The man told the jury he tried to get out of the car, but the child locks were on. When the door was eventually opened by the woman the fight started over, the man ran into the Goodna train station, where the police and ambulance service were called. The trial continues.
