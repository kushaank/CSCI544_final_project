
Q: Are there any plans to install traffic signals at Lely Resort Boulevard and U.S. 41 East, where the horse statues are at Lely? With the continued large growth in Lely by Stock Development and now the building of the Arlington of Naples continuing care retirement community, this light is sorely needed. Just try to get on Route 41 and go south — very dangerous.

A: The state does not see the need for a light yet at that location, according to information from Debbie Tower, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Transportation.

"We evaluated the U.S. 41/Lely Resort Boulevard intersection in 2012 and again during season this year (2014) for a traffic signal. It does not meet requirements for a signal," Tower said.

Traffic engineers use federal criteria in the "Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices" when they collect and analyze data to determine whether to approve a new signal, Tower explained.

"Staff also visits the intersection to monitor traffic patterns, turning movements, and conditions at the intersection," she said. "Analysis includes a review of volumes of traffic from side streets turning left and traveling through the intersection, the amount of ‘wait time' these drivers from side streets experience, and crash history."

Of course, as development in that area of Collier County continues to grow, the state will reconsider infrastructure needs.

"FDOT recognizes traffic volumes and conditions at the intersection may change over time, and we can review the U.S. 41/Lely Resort Boulevard intersection again in the future," Tower said.
