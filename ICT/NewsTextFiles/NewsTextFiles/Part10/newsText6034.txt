
Michael Dixon was one day out of rehab and driving with his young son when he couldn’t resist the call of heroin.

Then Dixon drove with 4-year-old Jordan to a gas station parking lot, bought heroin from a friend and injected it. When Dixon drove off, his car drifted across the centerline and into a bridge.

Michael Dixon was dead. His son was critically injured.

Michael Dixon’s death on March 23, 2013, was one of 227 related to heroin in Wisconsin last year — a record high — according to Gannett Wisconsin Media Investigative Team research. It marks a 10 percent increase from the 206 deaths in 2012.
