
It was a lonely life for Saudi Arabian man Ibrahim as he lay bedbound and paralysed in a hospital for months. Ibrahim met with an accident a year and half ago which left him bedridden and has not seen any visitors since then, not even family. He needed a life-changing surgery that he couldn't afford and that's when he thought of reaching out to his followers on Twitter.

He asked a few of his Twitter followers to come and pay him a visit at the hospital through a tweet, as he craved for company. The message soon became viral and his tweet created history, being the most retweeted tweet from Saudi Arabia at present. After being retweeted over 200,000 times, the hashtag #visitIbrahim started to trend in just 24 hours.

Flowers, gifts, and hundreds of visitors gathered outside the King Khaled Hospital in Riyadh where Ibrahim is admitted. The social media star's visitors forced the hospital staff to ban some of the other visitors in the hospital temporarily. Ibrahim benefitted financially as well.

Saudi Arabian man's tweet for help becomes the most retweeted tweet from Saudi Arabia.

The power of Twitter became evident when most of the visitors contributed money for his surgery that would cost around $130,000. Ibrahim will have to travel to Germany for his surgery and doctors hope that a trip to Germany will soon be possible for the young man with the funds collected.
