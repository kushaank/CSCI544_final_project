
Amman, May 18 (Petra) -- Jordan's anti-narcotics department thwarted an attempt to smuggle in 309 kilograms of cocaine hidden inside a container which arrived aboard a ship to the southern port city of Aqaba from a Southern American nation.

The unprecedented bust in the history of the Kingdom and the region was a culmination of four months of diligent work and follow-up by the concerned security agencies which had been acting on a tip-off that a group of persons were planning to smuggle in a large quantity of cocaine, the Public Security Department said in a statement.

The anti-narcotics agents learned about the name of the ship and details of the shipment days before it arrived at the Aqaba port and acted accordingly, the statement added. Those involved in the attempt were referred to competent bodies for further investigation.
