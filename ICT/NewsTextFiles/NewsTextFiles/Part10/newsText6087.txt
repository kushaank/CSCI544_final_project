
Southland's so-called 'cat lady' has appeared before the Invercargill District Court on a pair of nuisance-related charges.

The Invercargill local reportedly owns as many as 37 cats.

The local council decided to file legal action against the woman in March after years of working to contain the problem. Neighbours are fed up with the animals, saying the cats are constantly toileting and climbing over their properties.

The council has used a bylaw to get the woman to court, accusing her of breaching a law which prevents locals from owning more than three cats. The charge has been laid under the Local Government Act and comes with a maximum fine of $20,000.

The council has also laid a nuisance charge under the Health Act, accusing her of having animals which are "offensive" or likely to affect the health of others. It comes with a maximum fine of $500.

The woman was remanded at large and is due to enter a plea before the court next month.
