Most Americans believe in the concept of a just war, but they are less willing to fight than several other countries, according to a global survey.

America’s belief in the notion of just war is a relatively unpopular belief among other nations.

Of 55 nations surveyed, only the following had 50 percent or more reply “yes” to the conditional necessity of war to obtain justice: Pakistan, Egypt, Qatar, Australia, New Zealand, Libya and Lebanon.

The ability to field a strong national defense appeared to have little correlation to people’s willingness to fight.

Nearly 98 percent of Qataris were willing to fight for their country, topping the poll. Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand and Taiwan rounded out the top five.

Japan’s recent moves to strengthen its national defense have drawn criticism from China, but pacifism remains deeply ingrained in Japanese attitudes, according to the data.

Only 15 percent of Japanese said they were willing to fight for their country, putting them last on the list and well behind Spain, which was second-to-last at 28 percent. Also among Japanese respondents, only 14 percent said they believed in the notion of a just war.
