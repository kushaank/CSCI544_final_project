REGINA -- A Saturday afternoon collision between a truck and a road grader has left three people dead and four others injured.

According to information from the RCMP, the crash occurred at about 3:30 p.m. on Saturday when a northbound Toyota Tundra pickup truck carrying a driver and five passengers rear-ended a northbound grader on Grid Road 640 about six kilometres south of Punnichy.

Two male passengers from the truck â a 37-year-old from Sandy Bay and a 47-year-old from Gordonâs First Nation â died at the scene. A 30 year-old female passenger, also from Gordonâs First Nation, died while en route to hospital.

Police have not yet released the names of those killed.

The three remaining occupants of the truck were taken to hospital in Regina. As of Sunday morning, police were not able to provide additional information on their injuries. A family member of one of the people killed told the Leader-Post on Sunday that at least one of the three in hospital sustained significant injuries.

The operator of the grader was also injured, although police described his injuries as minor.

A collision analyst was called to the scene of the crash and is currently working to determine the cause. Charges have not yet been laid and are pending the outcome of the investigation, police said.

âThat takes quite a while for the report to get done ...,â said RCMP spokesman Sgt. Craig Cleary on Sunday.

Speaking generally, Cleary said incidents like this can take time to investigate since a number of avenues need to be explored, which can include witness interviews, awaiting toxicology results and allowing for the preparation of a collision analystâs report.
