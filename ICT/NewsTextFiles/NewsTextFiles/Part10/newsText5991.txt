
Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are slowly starting to reveal some details for their wedding such as date and location as the big day gets closer. Now baby North West’s mom reveals a little bit about her wedding dress too.

The bride-to-be has reportedly picked out her wedding dress as well as her bridesmaids dresses, and although no details were revealed, we can only assume it matches her Paris theme.

The couple were reportedly going to have a pre-wedding dinner on May 23 in Paris and fly guests out to the ceremony in Italy on private planes.

E! News now reports that the wedding will now take place in Versailles on May 24, which isn’t a big surprise since West and Kardashian visited the Palace of Versailles for an official tour.

However, this rule didn’t apply to Beyonce and Jay Z as Hollywood Life confirmed that the couple will be attending the wedding.

E! News confirmed that Bruce Jenner will be escorting the bride down the aisle after many reports stated that the decision was “non-negotiable.” Kardashian stated that she had already made up her mind from the beginning and wanted her step-father to give her away.

Kardashian and West have been traveling to Paris and Italy putting finishing touches on their wedding day, but have remained quiet about what we can expect.

In the mean time, Kardashian’s sisters Khloe and Kourtney as well as their mom Kris Jenner recently threw the bride-to-be a surprise bridal shower that was Paris themed.
