
Srinagar: Ruling National Conference in Jammu and Kashmir on Monday held a meeting of its core group to analyse the reasons for the party's debacle in the Lok Sabha elections. "A core group meeting was held under Farooq Abdullah to analyse the results of the recently concluded Lok Sabha elections," sources in the party said.

They said the meeting was attended by Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, cabinet ministers and senior party leaders. The meeting looked into the reasons for the worst-ever-show by the party in its electoral history and decided on the future course of action in view of the assembly elections scheduled later this year.

"It was decided to take feedback from the party activists on the reasons of the poor show in the elections and to chalk-out future strategy," the sources said. The meeting of the district and block presidents will take place on Tuesday, they said, adding the party will introspect to see what went wrong.

The meeting was attended by Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, cabinet ministers and senior party leaders.

"There will be deliberations and some measures will be taken to ensure the party performs better in the coming (assembly) elections," the sources said. The sources said the old-guard in the party has tightened its grip on the party affairs with the senior Abdullah, who is also the party president, taking the centre-stage.

"There may not be a face-lift in the party, but the old-guard for sure will have the grip on the party now and doctor sahib (Farooq Abdullah) will take all the decisions," they said.
