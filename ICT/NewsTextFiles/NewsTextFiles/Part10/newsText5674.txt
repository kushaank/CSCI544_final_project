
It was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime as German Stefan Ramin, 40, sailed around the world with his girlfriend, Heike Dorsch, 37, but it turned into a nightmare after he was murdered and she was assaulted by a French Polynesian tour guide.

Arihano Haiti, 33, was found guilty of killing Mr Ramin on Nuku Hiva, in French Polynesia, and sexually assaulting his girlfriend.

Mr Ramin had hired Haiti - a guide registered with authorities on the island - to take him on a goat hunt. He never returned.

Haiti was first arrested in 2011, amid claims that he had taken Mr Ramin hunting then killed him, carved him up and eaten parts of his body before setting fire to what remained.

He has been ordered to serve 28 years in jail, with no possibility of parole for 18 years.

Investigators were unable to prove the claims of cannibalism.
