
Travel software company  Datalex expects to announce its first non-aviation-based customer partnership  this year,  with the addition of rail operators.

In March, the Dublin-based firm announced its intention — as part of a three-phase, five-year growth plan — to expand its client roster beyond airlines by adding rail-service operators and more travel agency customers to its books.

Datalex yesterday said it is in discussions with potential partners and anticipates an announcement “in the coming months”.

Datalex provides software solutions to travel companies like Amadeus and Trailfinders, and   the bulk of its customer base comprises airlines such as Delta, South African Airways, Virgin Atlantic, Air China, Fiji Airways, and Aer Lingus.

Management yesterday said Datalex remains “on track” to meet its full-year adjusted earnings before tax  growth target of 18%-20% in 2014 and is “well-positioned for sustained growth”.

Yesterday’s trading update saw Datalex report an 18% annualised increase in transaction revenue for the first four months of the year. “Our financial position was robust at the end of 2013, with net cash reserves of $16.9m (€12.3m), and at the end of April remains strong. We will continue to grow our cash reserves in 2014, even after payment of our first dividend,” management said.

That dividend — of 2c per share —  was decided upon following a strong financial performance last year and approved by shareholders at the company’s AGM yesterday.

Datalex said its business pipeline continues to grow, with  Brussels Airlines, which is part of the Lufthansa Group, added to its clientele, and “a number of new opportunities” being pursued, with at least one additional customer expected to sign before the end of June.

Management also revealed plans to open an office in Beijing in the coming months.
