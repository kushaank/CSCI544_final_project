Juncker is visiting Athens today to promote his candidacy and support fellow conservative Antonis Samaras in the upcoming European polls.

"Two-and-a-half years after the conspiracy at the expense of the Greek people at Cannes, Mr Juncker is coming to Greece to support Mr Samaras, with whom he agrees on everything, except for their competition on who is more pro-memorandum and a better friend of Ms Merkel," a party statement read.

The harsh party communique referred to recent press reports suggesting that Juncker and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso had a hand in the toppling of then premier George Papandreou, after the Greek prime minister announced he would hold a referendum on Greece's bailout package.

It was at a dramatic November 2011 summit at Cannes, France that German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Nicolas Sarkozy demanded that Papandreou hold a referendum on Greece staying or leaving from the eurozone, which in turn led to the PM's ouster.

"These were the same people who agreed to install the government of [interim premier Lucas] Papademos, who executed the paid hit job with the PSI [debt haircut with private sector involvement], which destroyed individual bondholders and insurance funds. They are the same people who appointed a new government in order to circumvent the will of the Greek people," the Syriza statement concluded.
