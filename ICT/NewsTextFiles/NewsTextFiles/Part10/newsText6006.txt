Construction has begun on Bruno's of Brooklyn, an Italian restaurant that will serve, "high-quality artisan gourmet foods," at 2112 Second Street, downtown Fort Myers.

Chef-owner Calcedonio "Cal" Bruno and his wife, Genevieve, are turning this former deli space, located behind The Veranda, into a 25-seat quick-service eatery where busy business people can stop in for plates of pasta, hero sandwiches, Sicilian-style fritters and much more. They hope to open Bruno's in mid to late June.

"Everything's prepared fresh every day with only the best ingredients," Cal said. "We'll have steam tables where people can choose their dishes and have them ready to go, or sit down and eat right away."

Cal said Bruno's is the fulfillment of his father's dream of starting a restaurant. Cal spent his childhood summers in Sicily where he gained a passion for food. After three years of planning, the Brunos moved from Brooklyn to Fort Myers. They spent a year searching out the perfect space for their concept.

"We're catering to the government officials and county officials who don't have a full hour for lunch, but still want a great meal," Genevieve said.

Bruno's of Brooklyn's recipes are more than a century old, said Cal. The menu will feature several ingredients imported from Italy, and semolina breads flown in from bakeries in New York. It will offer sliced, cured meats, imported cheeses and a variety of desserts including zeppoli and cannoli.
