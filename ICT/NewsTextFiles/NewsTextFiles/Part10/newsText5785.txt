
Mimicking the BJP slogans, second hand cloth sellers in Ludhiana too have started saying “ache din aayenge”. One can see a large number of pherriwalas below the elevated road bridge near clock tower. They earn their living by selling second hand clothes which they collect from houses by exchanging few utensils.

They all hail from different parts of Gujarat but are now settled in Punjab for more than five decades. After the landslide victory of BJP in 2014 Lok Sabha election the pherriwalas have pinned their hopes on the Prime Minister-elect Narendra Modi.

Like Ramesh many others under this bridge sell old clothes for as little as Rs 10- 100, which are often bought by families who cannot afford buying new clothes. A number of them own small houses ranging from 50 square yard to 100 square yard in different parts of the city.

When Modi was Gujarat CM, he had sent Banvari a letter on the occasion of his son’s marriage.

The  Gujarati families have been settled in Amritsar, Jalandhar and other parts as well, and all of them are feeling important after the poll results.
