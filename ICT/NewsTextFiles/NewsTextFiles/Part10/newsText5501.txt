
Panathinaikos and Olympiakos will resume hostilities in the finals of the Greek league as they have both swept their opponents in the semifinal series after their away wins on Monday.

Olympiakos had to come from 14 points down (60-46) to force overtime (73-73) and then win 93-90 at Panionios thanks to a Vassilis Spanoulis three-pointer right at the end.

The RedsÂ’ skipper scored 22 points on the night to confirm he is back at his top form, as Olympiakos completed a 3-0 triumph in the best-of-five series with Panionios.

Panathinaikos produced a three-pointer show at Thessaloniki to fend off the strong challenge of host PAOK with a 72-65 score.

The Greens hit the target 14 times from outside the 6.75-meter line to clinch their third victory in as many games in the series, that appeared to trouble them more than expected, especially in the two games played last week in Athens.

Panathinaikos and Olympiakos will therefore face off for the ninth season in a row in the Greek finals, with the Greens holding the home advantage in the best-of-five series and hosting the Reds first on Thursday. Panionios and PAOK will fight for the third spot.
