
Business leaders are clubbing together to fix an iconic clock after city bosses refused to stump up the cash.

The timepiece on the Shandon Bells tower of St Anne’s Church in the heart of Cork city is loved by locals but has lay in disrepair for nine months.

After a fundraiser spearheaded by Red FM’s Neil Prendeville Show, local businesses are now collecting the €40,000 City Hall says it can’t afford.

He told the Irish Mirror: “It’s much loved, it’s iconic, it’s a symbol of Cork.

The Cork Business Association will now lend the required money to the city council.

However there is anger locally that the council has spent large sums on unnecessary projects while failing to repair the clock.

A ceremony granting President Michael D Higgins the Freedom of Cork last month cost a reported €30,000.

Mr Shannon added: “We’ve spent hundreds of thousands on road redesigns nobody wants, that have caused major traffic congestion.

“It shows a lack of concern that officials have in City Hall that they’re not prepared to spend €40,000 fixing it and are prepared to spend money on non-essential works.

Residents are now involved in the drive, with one woman calling the Neil Prendeville show to say she’d give €20 from her pension.

The historic building is around 200 years old and can be seen from almost anywhere in the city.

It is known as the “four faced liar” owing to the fact the clock faces never have the exact same time.

Mr Shannon said while he feels the fundraising campaign is a great initiative, the city council should have done more.
