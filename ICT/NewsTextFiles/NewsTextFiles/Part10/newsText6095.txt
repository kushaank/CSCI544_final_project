
FRAMINGHAM - A Framingham man threw his teen daughter into a television and then a woman prevented the girl from calling 911 for help on Sunday, a prosecutor said in Framingham District Court on Monday.

Framingham Police arrested Carlos Reyes, 44, and Beatriz Penaflor, 42, after the 5 p.m. dispute, prosecutor Wendi Safran said during Reyes' arraignment.

On Sunday, Reyes and his daughter were in the family room watching television when an argument between the two erupted and they began fighting over the remote control, the prosecutor said.

"The defendant grabbed her, and threw her into the television," said Safran. "She said her father manhandled her and shoved her into the television."

A witness told police that the girl was the first to make any physical contact during the dispute, the prosecutor said.

When the girl tried to call 911, Penaflor took the phone from her hands. The girl had to leave to call 911. It is unclear what Penaflor's relationship is to both Reyes and the girl.

Police arrested Reyes, of 47 Winthrop St., and charged him with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. Penaflor was charged with intimidation of a witness.

Safran asked Judge Douglas Stoddart to hold Reyes on $20,000 bail. Reyes, she said, just got out of federal prison in December after being sentenced to�15 years�on federal drug distribution charges.

Reyes' lawyer, Kenneth Gross, argued for Reyes' release, calling the case weak.

"It is extraordinary that they're asking for such a high bail for what basically is a misdemeanor," Gross said.

Stoddart set Reyes bail at $1,000 and ordered him to stay away and have no contact with his daughter. Stoddart released Penaflor without bail. They are both due back in court on June 10 for�a pretrial conference.
