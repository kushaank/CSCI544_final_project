
On May 1, 1775, shortly after the battles at Concord and Lexington, Jacob Perkins enlisted in the Provincial Army. Stationed at the camp in Cambridge he, along with other members of the Boxford militia, was in a company commanded by his neighbor, Capt. William Perley, in Col. James Frye�s regiment.

Capt. Perley�s company fought at Bunker Hill and then continued to be at Cambridge as part of the army that formed a blockade around Boston. Military records at the Massachusetts Archives show that Jacob Perkins served for 8 months. On Nov. 14, 1775 he was eligible for a coat, given as a bounty, or its equivalent in money for his service in 1775.

Jacob Perkins then returned to his farm in East Boxford, located off of Georgetown Road, near the present location of Great Pond Drive. The house, which dated from 1684, had been occupied by his grandfather and father. Although his father, Nathaniel Perkins, had a large family, there is no record that Jacob and his wife Mercy had any children.

According to Sidney Perley�s book, Dwellings of Boxford, several people in Boxford were infected with smallpox in 1776 and 1777. Smallpox epidemics occurred regularly in colonial Massachusetts with fearsome results. Fatality rates ran 25-30 percent and survivors could be badly scarred or blinded.

Jacob Perkins was the first Boxford victim at this time. Perley states, "It was understood that his wife was away at the time of his sickness and a young girl had the care of him. One day she went coasting down the slopes around the place and failed to administer the medicines at the proper time. From this neglect, it has come down by tradition, Mr. Perkins died."

Jacob Perkins was buried near his house. By the 1880�s when Sidney Perley was documenting Boxford�s history, Mr. Perkins� gravestone had shattered, but was still legible.

MR. JACOB PERKINS,

YEAR OF HIS AGE.

Read your doom,

Prepare to die.

Since Jacob Perkins� house was contaminated with smallpox, it became used as a pest house � a place where other people with the disease could go and live in isolation, without fear of spreading the contagion further. Jacob�s widow, Mercy Perkins, married Col. David Hobart of Haverhill in 1779, and the house was probably abandoned at that time.

In 1976, during the celebration of the Bicentennial of the American Revolution, members of the American Legion decided to locate the gravesite of Jacob Perkins in the "smallpox lot." Calling on the knowledge of Frank "Mellie" Gould, the Legion took their Colors and Firing Squad and had a small ceremony at the site on Memorial Day. Currently, Jacob Perkins� grave is accessible from a trail off Great Pond Drive.
