
KOZHIKODE: The Kerala State Women's Commission will submit a recommendation to the state police chief to make police more women-friendly.

The decision was taken in the wake of increase in the number of complaints against police in executing warrants issued against the accused in matrimonial disputes.

"During the adalat, held, here, on Monday we received five complaints according to which the police personnel were showing reluctance to execute the warrants issued by the court," said advocate Noorbina Rasheed, member of the commission.

According to the complainants though the accused are present in the locality, the police delay their arrest claiming that they could not locate the accused. "The complainants have sought our intervention in the cases which are pending before the courts," she said, adding that it was, however not possible for them to intervene in cases under the consideration of courts. "We have, however, decided to bring the issue to the notice of the state police chief with a recommendation to make police force more  women friendly," she said.

A recommendation in this regard will be prepared jointly by the members of the commission during the next meeting at Thiruvananthapuram.

The commission, during its adalat, considered a total of 58 complaints on Monday. While 21 cases were settled and closed, 4 cases will be considered by the full bench during the next sessions and one will be considered by the Jagratha Samithi. Other cases will be considered during the next adalat.

Most of the cases of the commission were related to property and matrimonial dispute.
