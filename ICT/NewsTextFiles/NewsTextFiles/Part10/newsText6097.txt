Prosecutors will fight to keep in jail the Occupy Wall Street protester recently convicted of assaulting a cop, law-enforcement sources told The Post.

Cecily McMillan, the 25-year-old “queen of non-violence” who was found to have intentionally elbowed a cop in the eye during a demonstration at Zuccotti Park, faces as little as probation at her sentencing Monday. But prosecutors will try to convince Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Ronald Zweibel to slap her with jail time for the felony assault, which carries a maximum sentence of seven years.

McMillan was remanded to Rikers Island earlier this month after a jury convicted her of assaulting NYPD Officer Grantley Bovell as he escorted her from the protest. She previously turned down a no-jail deal in exchange for pleading to the felony.

Defense attorney Martin Stolar plans to appeal the conviction.

“If she’s sentenced to jail, there will be another motion to get her released pending an appeal,” he said.

McMillan claimed Bovell grabbed her breast from behind, prompting her to respond. She testified that she didn’t remember what happened after she was arrested and claimed to have suffered a seizure.
