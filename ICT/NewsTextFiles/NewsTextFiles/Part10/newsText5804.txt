
GURGAON: Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam officials will meet today to discuss the implementation of Advanced Meter Infrastructure (AMI) technology in the city to manage the load supplied to consumers wirelessly.

The discom will install smart meters for consumers by the year-end and a remote control centre will be set up in Hisar to monitor and control power supply in Gurgaon. The cost of the project is expected to be 120 crores. Arun Kumar Verma, managing director, DHBVN said issues like the viability, the advantages and disadvantages of the AMI system will be discussed. "The modalities regarding the allotment of tenders and contracts for maintenance and service of the facilities will also be discussed in the meeting," he said.

"As of now we can only keep tabs on the meter reading and not control the usage. But with the new smart meters, DHBVN will also be able to control the load on each meter connected wirelessly through GPRS at the control room," general manager Sanjeev Chopra said.

"In the event of a shortage in power supply, load can be reduced from one meter and supplied to anotherto balance power distribution during peak demand and thereby reduce power cuts in the city," said Chopra.
