Key international media with an overall reach of over 3.2 million arrived in Ireland today as part of the first in a series of “super showcase events” organised by Fáilte Ireland.

The group will be taken on a journey along the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland’s first long-distance touring route. Fáilte Ireland is investing €10 million during 2014 in the route which stretches from the Inishowen Peninsula in Donegal to Kinsale in County Cork and already the new attraction is garnering significant interest overseas.

The travelling group include representatives from CNN, CBS and World Tourism China and cover a wide range of markets such as Britain, US and China as well as Holland and Italy. Their itinerary will showcase the northern route of the Wild Atlantic Way taking in counties Donegal, Sligo, Mayo and Galway.

Over the next few weeks, dedicated Swizz and German media groups will arrive into Ireland and will also be taken on a trip along the route.

Fiona Monaghan, Fáilte Ireland’s Head of Project for the Wild Atlantic Way welcomed the group: “I am delighted to welcome the first of these influential media groups to Ireland and to the Wild Atlantic Way. I have no doubt they will be impressed with the world’s longest touring route through some of Ireland’s most beautiful places.
