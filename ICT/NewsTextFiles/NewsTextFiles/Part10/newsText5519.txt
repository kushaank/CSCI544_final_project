
The Crystal Star Awards gala recently celebrated outstanding women business owners recently, naming winners from construction, personal property care and health services.

Margit Glenn, a partner with her husband Tom in Visionarch LLC of Port Orchard, was named a 2014 Shining Star for a business that seeks to build bridges between designers, builders and those for whom they are constructing custom residences. She also is a past president of Key Peninsula Toastmasters and a board member of the sponsoring Alliance of Women Owned Businesses.

The 2014 Rising Star award was presented to Sarah Friesen, founder of Gig Harbor Home Management, a firm that provides customized home watch services for residents who spend extended time traveling or chasing the sun through winter months. Friesen created the business in 2011 and has now grown it to include several employees.

Laura Day-Moran, AuD, the owner of Harbor Audiology & Hearing Services Inc., received the 2014 Crystal Star honor. She purchased her first practice in Gig Harbor in the late 1990s and added a second outlet in Tacoma in 2007. She is also an active member of Gig Harbor Mid-day Rotary and has been on a number of trips to Guatemala providing hearing tests, the fitting of aids and working with children in need.
