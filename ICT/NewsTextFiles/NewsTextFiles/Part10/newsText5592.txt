It was a chaotic end to the night out at a bar in north Houston when a big fight broke out.

It happened around 1:40am in the parking lot of Clayton's nightclub on Beltway 8 and Greenspoint Drive.

Police say a group of people started fighting. Some were armed with crowbars and others used their vehicles to run people down. It all ended with someone shooting a gun, but no one was shot.

"We've got one person in custody for aggravated assault for hitting another person over the head with a tire iron," said Lt. Larry Crowson with Houston Police Department.

Authorities say a driver ran over two other people. Paramedics rushed two people to the hospital.  Two others drove themselves for treatment.

An investigation is underway.
