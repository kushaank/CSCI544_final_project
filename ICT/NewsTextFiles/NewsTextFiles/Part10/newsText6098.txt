
The NSW government suspended Metgasco's exploration licence for a farm near Bentley last week, days before drilling was set to commence.

The company's lack of community consultation was cited as a reason for the suspension.

The Office of Coal Seam Gas has been urged to undertake a speedy examination of Metgasco's Bentley licence, but the office has told Metgasco the review is not yet completed, and was unable to confirm how much longer it would take.

Metgasco has provided a lengthy submission to the office, which the company says demonstrates it has fully complied with conditions related to community consultation.

It said it remains committed to gas resources in the region, despite contrary media reports.

Metgasco has also brought in lawyers to advise it on the licence suspension.

Its share price has fallen by 48 per cent since the licence suspension, and on Tuesday the shares were down 0.2 of a cent to 4.7 cents by 1130 AEST.

Metgasco was also last week referred by the state government to the Independent Commission against Corruption.

It is understood the referral is connected to the Obeid-linked Australian Water Holdings and ERM Power Limited, which owns about 12 per cent of Metgasco.
