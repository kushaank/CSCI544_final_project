
Nine-year-old Australian girl Angie Scarth-Johnson is one of the most talented young climbers. Angie travels around the world with her non-climbing parents who needed to learn to belay. But Angie rewarded them generously: on last 6 November she red-pointed Swingline at the Red River Gorge, Kentucky, becoming the youngest person ever to climb 8b. But it's not all: some weeks ago, Angie visited Margalef in Spain and climbed Zona 30 where she got another wonderful 8b.

Angie is sponsored by C.A.M.P. distributor in Australia Climbing Anchors. In the last days she was in Italy and wanted to visit C.A.M.P. head office in Premana where harnesses designers Ottavio and Liz made her a unique mini Supernova harness. �I think I may be the luckiest girl alive right now � Angie said �: C.A.M.P. friends made me a custom made harness, and it's got my name on it!�. Smiling and lively Angie visited our R&D office and she was very excited �to learn how everything in C.A.M.P. is made and tested for the best safety possible�. During her family holiday in Italy, Angie climbed with the young athletes of Premana climbing team, participating to Melloblocco too.

Melloblocco is a really cool bouldering festival. During the meeting, thousands of international climbers arrive in Masino valley, in the central Alps, to achieve the endless boulders of this rock paradise. Angie climbed some of them and she wanted to stay longer in the valley, but her family had to go home in Australia. Angie came to the CASSIN booth in Masino valley to say us goodbye: �This is a wonderful place and I would like to stay here for longer � she said �. I'm happy to have met Andrea, Liz, Luca and the rest of the C.A.M.P. team that spent time showing me around Melloblocco. I hope to come back next year!�.

Eventually, before leaving from Milan Malpensa airport, Angie posted a nice picture in her Facebook page: �My trip to Europe has finished � she wrote - : thanks to all the new friends that I have made in Spain and Italy for being part of this awesome trip!�.
