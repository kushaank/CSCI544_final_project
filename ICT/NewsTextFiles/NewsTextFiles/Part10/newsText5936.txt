
Benedict Cumberbatch, Will Poulter and Tye Sheridan will take the screen together for war drama “The Yellow Birds”.

David Lowery will direct the film which will see Poulter and Sheridan play two young soldiers who look to an older sergeant (Cumberbatch) for guidance as they’re deployed to Iraq.

Lowery also penned the script which was adapted from Kevin Powers’ novel. Powers served in Iraq in 2004 and 2005.

Cumberbatch can next be seen in historical drama “The Imitation Game” while Sheridan can be caught in “Scouts vs. Zombies”. Poulter’s upcoming projects include “The Maze Runner” and “Glassland”.

If it's a half-decent action movie you're beseeching... Here's one, it’s 'half' decent.
