
Panaji, May 19 (IANS) Red tape and prison formalities Monday prevented rape accused and former Tehelka editor-in-chief Tarun Tejpal from performing the last rites of his mother at a crematorium here.

Tejpal was granted interim bail by the Supreme Court earlier in the day, and arrived at the crematorium after his younger brother Minty Kumar had already lit the pyre in the presence of family members and friends.

Family sources said despite the bail order by the apex court, prison formalities delayed his arrival at the crematorium on the outskirts of the state capital in time to perform the last rites.

Tejpal is at present lodged at the Sada sub-jail in South Goa, located 40 km from Panaji.

His mother Shakuntala, who was unwell for a long time, died Sunday night at Tejpal's Goa home.

Tejpal was allowed by a local court to visit his ailing mother in the past, but he was denied bail in April by the Panaji bench of the Bombay High Court.

Tejpal then approached the Supreme Court for bail, the hearing is expected to come up later this month.

The journalist has already spent five months behind bars for allegedly raping a junior colleague during an event organised by Tehelka promoters at a five star resort in Goa in November last year.
