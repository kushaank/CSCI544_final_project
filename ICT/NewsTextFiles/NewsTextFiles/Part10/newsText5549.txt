
After reading the details and seeing the picture, you might think an 18 year old man would have suffered serious injuries, or worse, from a crash late Sunday.

The Gage County Sheriffâ€™s office says Jessie Padilla of Beatrice was driving at a high rate of speed when his GMC Jimmy left the road just southwest of Beatrice.  He was traveling eastbound on West Belvidere Road, just east of Southwest 32nd Road.  The vehicle rolled onto its side and came to a rest on the side of the roadway.   The incident was reported about 10:45 p.m.

Padilla suffered injuries described only as minor.   Crash investigators say he was not wearing a seat belt.   He was checked over on the scene and turned over to family members who later took him to a hospital for further care.

Padilla was cited for careless driving, seat belt violation, and false reporting.
