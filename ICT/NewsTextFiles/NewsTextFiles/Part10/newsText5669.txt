
A bride and a groom in Croatia have arrived for a wedding in church each one riding their own motorcycle.  Dijana Milic (34) and Dusko Petrinovic (34) have met at a motor party and before the wedding have done 60,000 kilometres long journey on their motorcycles around Europe.  The bride kitted out in a full wedding dress rode on her motorcycle to the wedding ceremony in a Catholic church in eastern town of Cepin.  Dijana is a nurse and Dusko is a butcher but more than anything else they love motorcycles and their adventurous tours.  Organisers of the upcoming West Balkan Rally have decided to invite them for a 3,000 kilometres ride as a newly wed couple.
