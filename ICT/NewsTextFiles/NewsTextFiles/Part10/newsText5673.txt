
An alleged cannibal has been jailed for 28 years after he was accused of killing and eating a German tourist.

Arihano Haiti, 33, was accused of murdering Stefan Ramin and sexually assaulting his girlfriend Heike Dorsch before going on the run for nearly two months.

Haiti was arrested in 2011 following the incident on Nuku Hiva, French Polynesia, after Miss Dorsch, who was tied up, managed to free herself and raise the alarm.

The court heard that Haiti had killed the 40-year-old who was on a round-the-world trip with Ms Dorsch, 37, and they had anchored off the coast of Polynesia in September 2011.

At the time of the incident it was reported that Haiti had eaten Mr Ramin but investigators told the trial that they had been unable to establish if this was true.

Haiti claims that he shot Mr Ramin because he had sexually assaulted him so he killed him and sexually assaulted Miss Dorsch in revenge.

However, detectives in Germany working together with the local investigators say they had found no evidence that the German had any homosexual tendencies.

A lawyer for the dead man's family, Yves Pirou, said that the accused's allegations were a work of fiction.

He said the reality was exactly the opposite and while there was no indication that the victim had any homosexual tendencies, he alleged that Haiti was known to have had regular contact with transvestites and the probability is far more likely that the hunter had raped the tourist or at least tried to rape him.

This was backed up by investigators who pointed out that the hunter was physically far bigger and stronger than the German man.
