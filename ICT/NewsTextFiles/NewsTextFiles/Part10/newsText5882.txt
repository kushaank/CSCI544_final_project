Loreto College Swords student, Chloe Marks has won the initial All-Ireland Loreto Schools Bake Off competition last week, beating off stiff opposition on the way to her triumph.

“We are very proud of all of the girls who participated at the local school level, and of course, the two girls who represented us in Donegal. It’s a great honour for the school. In fact the girls in the school are asking Chloe if she will bake a cake for the upcoming graduation,” he said.

then described her winning entry: “My cake was a Lemon Drizzle which I decorated with colourful daisies and the Loreto crest. I couldn’t believe it when I won and I hope to study Culinary Arts in DIT,” said a delighted Chloe.
