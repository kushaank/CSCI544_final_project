
Ngcobo - A 37-year-old patient was attacked and killed by another at a hospital in Ngcobo, Eastern Cape police said on Sunday.

"The 22-year-old patient allegedly attacked another patient with an iron rod inside a ward and killed him," spokesman Lt-Col Mzukisi Fatyela said.

The incident happened at All Saints Hospital in Ngcobo on Friday.

Health department spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said the two patients had been sitting in a toilet andÂ smoking the night before the murder.

"In the early hours of the morning, a nurse on duty heard movements in the ward and a steel rod drop on the floor," he said.

The nurse went to investigate and found one patient having been assaulted and lying on the bed.

"The nurse called on security to help restrain the other patient who was uncontrollable and wild," Kupelo said.

The alleged killer was admitted for epilepsy, while the deceased had a chronic illness.

Kupelo said Health MEC Sicelo Gqobana visited the hospital and met the doctors. He also met both of the patients' families.

"The MEC has appointed a team to investigate how one patient managed to assault and kill another, why did the alleged killer suddenly go on a violent rampage, and also find out what it that the two men had to smoke in the toilets the night before."

The department had undertaken to pay for the funeral, he said.

"We call on both families to allow the investigation to be completed. We take this as an unfortunate incident that has happened in one of our hospitals," Kupelo said.
