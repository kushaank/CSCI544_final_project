On May 19, 2013, the  EF-4 tornado tore through Steelman Estates, destroying dozens of homes and turning memories into debris.

The deadly tornado tore through the community, taking the lives of Glen Irish,79, and Billy Hutchinson,76.

Clayton Cook says he still struggles with the loss.

Now they are in the process of rebuilding and there is a silver lining in the dark clouds that once stormed over the neighborhood.

Cook says they’ve installed eight community shelters which will fit about 80 people.

Cook believes the shelters were a good investment.
