
A long-awaited directive on intra-corporate transfers was adopted last week by the Council of the European Union, following a positive vote in the European Parliament in April.

The directive will make it easier for international companies to transfer managers, specialists and trainees temporarily to a branch in the EU, as well as allowing them to work in other member states during the assignment.

Gill Gordon, chair of the Permits Foundation and an HR director with Schlumberger, congratulates the EU on reaching agreement. '’The changes will position Europe as the number one region globally to attract highly qualified talent and facilitate their career moves,"  she said.

"Allowing family members to work makes it easier for a highly qualified employee to accept a transfer if their partner doesn't have to give up their own career aspirations," said Kathleen van der Wilk, executive director of Permits Foundation. ''That's good for the family, good for business and good for the European economy."

Ellen Shipley, head of global mobility and immigration at BT, is hopeful. "Ideally, member states should move swiftly to implement the directive and adopt fast-track application processes, with only complex cases taking the maximum allowable 90 days to review."

Permits Foundation is an independent, not-for-profit organisation campaigning globally to improve work permit regulations to make it easier for partners of expatriate staff to gain employment during an international assignment.
