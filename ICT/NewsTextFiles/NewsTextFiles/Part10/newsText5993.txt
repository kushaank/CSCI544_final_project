Former prime minister Pierre Trudeau and his son, Justin Trudeau, meet with Pope John Paul II during a visit to Rome in June of 1980. In an email to supporters Monday, Justin Trudeau, now the federal Liberal Leader, said he had a very religious upbringing, but noted that his father's deeply held personal views did not stop him from standing up for people's rights.

OTTAWA—Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau says he is following an example set by his famous father when it comes to his position on election candidates and abortion.

In an email to supporters Monday, Trudeau offered a “personal reflection” to anyone who has concerns about his decision to turn away new candidates who are unwilling to vote pro-choice on relevant Liberal legislation.

“But at the same time my father had no problem legalizing divorce, decriminalizing homosexuality and moving in ways that recognized the basic rights of the people.

Trudeau says he shares his father’s view of leadership in that regard.

“Canadians of all views are welcome within the Liberal Party of Canada. But under my leadership, incoming Liberal MPs will always vote in favour of a woman’s fundamental rights,” he wrote.

Toronto’s Roman Catholic archbishop, Cardinal Thomas Collins, has written to Trudeau , urging him to allow candidates to be faithful to their conscience.

Trudeau says while he welcomes input from the prelate, his party is committed to the values laid out in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
