
Ohio Lt. Governor and Department of Insurance Director Mary Taylor will host a “Welcome to Medicare” event at 6 p.m. Thursday at the Dayton Jewish Community Center, 525 Versailles Drive.

The event is designed to help new and soon-to-be beneficiaries understand the basics of Medicare as more than 10,000 Ohioans turn 65 and become eligible for the federal health insurance program each month, according to the state insurance department.

The Dayton visit is one of 19 Ohio Senior Health Insurance Information Program (OSHIIP) events being held throughout the state through the end of this month, which has been designated Older Americans Month.

“With events scheduled in every region of the state this spring, I encourage Ohioans who recently enrolled in Medicare or those becoming eligible later this year to attend and learn more about their coverage options,” Taylor said in a news release.

OSHIIP, which has been the state’s designated Medicare educational and enrollment assistance program since 1992, last year helped more than 168,000 consumers save a record $16.4 million through its toll-free hotline, in-person counseling, and more than 1,500 outreach events, according to the insurance department.
