
Ciao, Harry! Imagine running into an English prince while you’re doing what tourists do when in Rome — touring the famous Colosseum.

Prince Harry wasn’t supposed to be there today — it wasn’t on his schedule — but there he was anyway, red hair unmistakable, dressed in a blue-checked shirt and jeans. Casually, he lounged against a railing as a guide explained the details of the 1,934-year-old amphitheater where gladiators and beasts once clashed before crowds of 50,000 screaming-for-blood Romans.

A group of about two dozen Canadian and American tourists could not believe their eyes when they realized it was Harry standing next to them. Hundreds more visitors in galleries above caught sight of him and started waving, aiming their cameras and shouting his name, the Associated Press reported.

Harry was wrapping up a four-day official visit to Estonia and Italy, mostly to commemorate WWII anniversaries. Earlier today, he wore his dress-white uniform for a visit to the Commonwealth cemetery in Monte Cassino south of Rome, where he met with veterans of the 1944 Battle of Montecassino and laid a poppy wreath.

On Sunday, he visited the Benedictine Abbey of Monte Cassino, which was nearly destroyed in the 123-day battle and then rebuilt after the war.

The good, the bad and the ugly.

It’s spot on.

It was moving.
