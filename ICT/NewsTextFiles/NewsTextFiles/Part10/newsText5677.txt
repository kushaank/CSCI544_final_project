
Internet search giant Google is puzzling visitors to its homepage today with an interactive and animated doodle that lets them virtually play with the RubikÂ’s Cube on the 40th anniversary of the toy.

The Rubik's Cube Google Doodle grows larger in size when a user lands on Google's homepage and clicks on the doodle. The question mark at the bottom right, when clicked, instructs users on how to play with the cube on the screen - swipe outside the cube to rotate it, and swipe inside the cube to twist it.

A counter on the bottom left counts the number of twists and turns a player takes to complete the doodled puzzle.

In reality, Mats Valk of the Netherlands holds the fastest time it has taken to complete the puzzle , at 5.55 seconds.

The Rubik's Cube, which consists of a coloured squares a player must twist and turn in order to make each side of the cube a uniform colour, had originally been known as the Magic Cube.

Hungarian architecture professor Erno Rubik invented the puzzle in 1974 to help explain three-dimensional geometry.

Since then, about 350m Rubik's Cubes have been sold to date, making it still one of the world's best-selling puzzle games.
