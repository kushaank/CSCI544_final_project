
Nestled in the rocky mountains of Colorado, nearly 2,000 miles from Southwest Florida, is where you'll find the Pendarvis family.

While the outside of their Aurora home looks like most, their lives are very different.

In 2009 a drunk driver rear-ended Christina and Jeff Pendarvis on US-41 in Fort Myers.

One-month-old Chase was rushed to the hospital where doctors diagnosed him with traumatic brain injuries.

"You've got this beautiful baby you just watched come into the world, and a month later you think he is going to get taken away from you. And luckily he didn't," said Jeff.

Not long after, Chase began convulsing. He began suffering from upward of 300 seizures a week.

"If I even tried to kiss him, it would scare him," said Christina.

Doctors put the infant on a cocktail of prescription drugs. Each carried potential side effects like brittle bones and liver damage.

His parents say he became a sedated son.

They moved out west in search of liquid medical marijuana.

Dr. Alan Shackelford was one of two doctors who signed off on Chase to use the strain, known as Charlotte's Web.

It's low in THC, which is what makes smokers high, and high in CBD, which is thought to control seizures.

"We've used the narcotics, we've used all the benzodiazepines, nothing works. Now let's try this," said Dr. Shackelford.

Chase's seizures dropped by more than half since his first dose in November.

Today, they're almost non-existent.

The same form of marijuana is on the verge of being legalized in Florida.

While Christina and Jeff don't plan to move back, they are thankful other families won't be forced to move away.

"You'd rather see him lose his life than give me access to a plant that could save him?" asked Christina. "Makes no sense."
