Štefan Füle, European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy at the EBRD Annual meeting (Warsaw, Poland, 14 May 2014) underlined the EU efforts in enlargement. He gave some concrete examples of the EU’s most powerful enlargement instrument to support transition in the accession countries.

The attractiveness of the “European model” and its values, combined with the strengthening of the EU’s policies, has deepened the EU ties with the neighboring countries, while challenges remain to be addressed in the years ahead.

However, Enlargement has not been without challenges; however, the ultimate wish to move forward on crucial reform issues cannot come from the European Union, but from the member states’ governments too.

• On 21 March 2014, the EU signed the political chapters of the Association Agreement and in May adopted a set of unilateral trade measures that opened the European Union's market to Ukrainian goods;

• The EU created a Support Group to help Ukraine to implement so-called “European agenda for reform” encompassing political and economic reforms agreed with Ukraine;

• The EU has made additional €1 billion of Macro-Financial Assistance available in a new program;

However, progress on reform has remained uneven. In Egypt, for example, transition has been slower; in Libya, the political instability is delaying the economic recovery, in a country which however offers substantial investment opportunities. And then, there is the continuing horror in Syria.

It is therefore important the role of International Financing Institutions, in particular the EBRD, which has helped to assist countries in transition into free, open and stable societies across Europe.
