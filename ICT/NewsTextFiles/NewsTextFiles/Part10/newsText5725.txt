
Led by researchers at the Institute of Photonic Sciences in Castelldefels ( ICFO ), Spain, the researchers developed the lab-on-a-chip with gold nano-particles on its surface that are chemically programmed with anitibody receptors specifically designed to attract protein markers for cancer in the blood.  When a blood droplet is placed on the surface of the chip, it travels through the chip's microchanels.  The cancer proteins stick to receptors on the microchannels as they pass by, setting of a 'plasmodic resonance' equivalent to the amount of cancer proteins present in the sample.  Thus, the lab-on-a-chip not only identifies the presence of cancer protein in the blood, but a measurement of it as well.

ICREA Professor at ICFO Romain Quidant, coordinator of the project, said that "the most fascinating finding is that we are capable of detecting extremely low concentrations of this protein in a matter of minutes, making this device an ultra-high sensitivity, state-of-the-art, powerful instrument that will benefit early detection and treatment monitoring of cancer."
