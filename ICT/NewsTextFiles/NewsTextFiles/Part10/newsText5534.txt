
A footwear godown in Central Delhi’s Karol Bagh was completely gutted following a fire that broke out on Sunday morning. Goods worth several lakhs of rupees were destroyed in the fire, but no casualty was reported.

According to the police, the accident was likely a result of an electrical short-circuit.

The fire broke out around 7.30 a.m. at the godown, which is on the second floor of a three-storey building on Gurudwara Road. According to the police, a worker entered the godown and switched the light, which allegedly caused a spark that ignited the fire.

Since the switch was near the door of the godown, the worker was unable to contain the flames. The fire soon spread out to other parts of the premises as well.

In the next 10 minutes, the fire engulfed all the floors above the second floor.

“The material used to make boxes that contain the shoes and slippers is combustible. This enabled the fire to spread quickly,” said the officer.

The fire department was informed and 11 fire tenders rushed to the spot. It took an hour to douse the flames. The last fire tender returned only after 10 a.m.

The building is situated on a busy road and surrounded by mostly several retail shoe shops.

However, since it was early in the day and the shops were closed, not many people were affected.
