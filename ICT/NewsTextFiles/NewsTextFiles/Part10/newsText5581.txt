
GUNTUR: An aged couple made a bid to protect their son despite the latter making an attempt to murder them in Bapatla on Monday. Even while struggling for life with bleeding injuries in hospital, the parents accused a financier as offender in an attempt to save their son from law.

The police were surprised when they found that the son was the criminal. According to information, a rickshaw-puller K Rambabu borrowed money from local financiers and was in trouble with them.

Rambabu's son Srinivasa Rao, a daily-wager, reportedly warned his father to stop borrowing. Meanwhile, a financier reportedly visited their house on Saturday and abused Rambabu for not clearing his dues. Felt humiliated, Srinivasa Rao returned home in an inebriated condition in the late hours of Sunday and allegedly attacked his parents Rambabu and Parvathamma with a sharp knife in the wee hours of Monday. He fled the scene after slitting their throats.

The locals, who found the aged couple in a pool of blood in the morning, alerted the police. Police reached the spot and rushed the couple to hospital. Giving a twist to the story, Rambabu in a statement to the police said that financier Naresh attacked them for not repaying his loan. Police launched a search and nabbed Naresh. During the grilling, police found that Naresh did not visit Rambabu's residence after Sunday night.
