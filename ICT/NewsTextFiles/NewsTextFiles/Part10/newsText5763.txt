
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Rajnath Singh has invited two leaders from Andhra Pradesh - TDP president Chandrababu Naidu and Jana Sena founder Pawan Kalyan - to Tuesday's meeting of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Delhi.

Media reports claimed that Singh has invited both Naidu and Pawan to Delhi to participate in the NDA meeting. TDP is a partner in NDA, and Pawan campaigned extensively for the TDP-BJP alliance in Andhra Pradesh for the elections to both Lok Sabha and the state Assembly.

Pawan is likely to fly to Delhi on 20 May morning, whereas Naidu is set to reach the capital on Monday night itself. BJP's parliamentary board meeting will formally elect Modi as its leader on Tuesday. It is a formality before making Modi the Prime Minister.

The BJP meeting will be followed by the NDA meeting on the same day. NDA coalition parties will have to choose Modi as their leader, before making him the PM.

Pawan had declared that he did not want to split votes in AP by fielding candidates from his new party. The Telugu star had called upon people to root out "corrupt Congress" in this elections. Even the people in Seemandhra have also completely ignored Congress and voted to the TDP-BJP alliance.

But the actor's recent statements spell out his future plans to build the party on a large scale that could span both Seemandhra and Telangana.
