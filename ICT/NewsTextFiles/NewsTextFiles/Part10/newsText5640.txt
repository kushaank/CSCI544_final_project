
Qatar Red Crescent (QRC) is going ahead with its healthcare programme for Syrian refugees in northern Lebanon.

Launched in October 2012, the programme was    initially planned to end in March 2014. However, it was prolonged to the    end of 2014 amid a pressing need for medical services in targeted    regions.

The objective of the programme is to cover    surgery and medication costs for Syrian refugees, particularly the    wounded cases moved from Syria to northern Lebanon. For this purpose,    the QRC mission signed contracts with five local hospitals.

Having cost $2.8mn till the end of March, the    budget of the project was augmented with an additional $2.7mn to  finance   medical care services from April to December 2014.

QRC secretary-general Saleh bin Ali    al-Mohannadi explained that the eight-month extension was to make up for    the lack of government assistance for refugees not registered with  the   Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  (UNHCR)  and  declining healthcare coverage for those already  registered.

Under the programme, QRC provided large-scale    medical assistance to more than 10,000 Syrians so far, 86% of whom were    UNHCR-registered and received partial medication coverage from QRC,    while the remaining 14% UNHCR-uncovered refugees were fully funded by    QRC.

The medical mission enabled the treatment of    480 cardiovascular patients, who underwent major and, sometimes, serial    surgeries at the contracted hospitals. Another 224 injuries, some of    which were critical, were successfully medicated by QRC at a time when    other international organisations were standing inactive.
