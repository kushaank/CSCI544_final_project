
A 4-month-old is fighting for her life at University of New Mexico Hospital after brain surgery following a case of suspected abuse.

The child was in the care of her mother's boyfriend Michael Hyer. When the 4-month-old's mother got home Saturday, police said her child was limp and had a mark near her ear.

The infant was rushed to the hospital where she underwent emergency brain surgery because of cranial swelling.

Police said Hyer gave them several stories as to what happened Saturday. It's unclear how the child was injured. He also expressed resentment for caring for the children.

Hyer was arrested and charged with child abuse with great bodily harm.
