
Bollywood superstar Shahrukh Khan has taken to social media to clear the air about the ongoing rumours about the Chennai Express Star leaving India if Narendra Modi comes to power.

In his Twitter and Facebook message, Khan slammed the fake tweets that put the Bollywood star in a negative light.

Good time to tell all fools who r talking of a tweet that I didn't tweet, u suck as much as the grammar of that fake tweet & I'm being kind.

The tweet went viral on Twitter after another actor Kamal R Khan claimed to leave India as the Hindu nationalist party achieved majority seats in the parliamentary election. In his tweet, he even challenged King Khan.

Fans of the superstar too came up to support their favourite star and tweeted their unhappinesse over such rumours.
