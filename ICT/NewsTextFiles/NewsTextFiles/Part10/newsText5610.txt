
A Scottish woman is in a serious condition in Pisa after falling into the river Arno, Italian media reported on Sunday.

A fellow Scot caught the attention of passers-by, who called the emergency services, bringing in the fire brigade to rescue the tourist.

Police have opened an investigation to find out how the woman, thought to have been heavily drinking before the accident, fell into the river.

In recent years multilingual signs have been put up around Pisa to warn tourists of the dangers of the risk of falling into the Arno, La Repubblica said.
