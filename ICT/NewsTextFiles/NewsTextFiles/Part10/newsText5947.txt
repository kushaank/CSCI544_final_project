
Four Iraqi civilians were killed and five others injured in a mortar attack by the Iraqi army on residential areas in Fallujah, a local hospital official said Sunday.

"The injured victims were brought to the hospital, but the bodies of the victims were taken to the forensic department," Wessam al-Essawi, the spokesman of Fallujah General Hospital, added.

Medics had fled Fallujah General Hospital in western Iraq on Sunday because of continued Iraqi army shelling of the medical facility, according to the hospital spokesman.

"The army continues to fire mortars and rockets at the hospital, prompting many medics to leave," Wessam al-Essawi told Anadolu Agency.

"Only three doctors and few nurses decided to stay behind to help the wounded civilians," he added.

Al-Essawi called on the Iraqi Health Ministry to intervene to stop "indiscriminate attacks on medical facilities and the homes of innocent citizens in Fallujah."

Iraqi army officials were not immediately available to comment on the accusations.

Since last December, the Iraqi army has been battling militants in the western Anbar province, of which Fallujah is a key city.

Since the offensive began, hundreds of civilians have been killed and injured, according to government officials.
