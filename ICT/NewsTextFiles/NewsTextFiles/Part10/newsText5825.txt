
At The Hindu EducationPlus Career Counselling 2014 programme here on Sunday, Dr. Kumar said students should not entertain touts or agents who promise them seats in colleges. He also urged students and parents to report impersonation, if any, to the COMEDK or the police.

It may be noted that the police recently arrested 35 people, including two touts, for their alleged involvement in the seat-blocking scam.

The office was raided on Saturday after police officials suspected the involvement of a few private college managements. They obtained search warrants from the first Additional Chief Metropolitan Court and raided the premises looking for documents.

Dr. Kumar also said if there was any wrongdoing on the part of the college after a student joined the course, the students should complain to the regulatory body concerned.

“There have been instances when students have been exploited. But, the role of COMEDK authorities ends at the counselling process. Students should complain to the Medical Council of India, Dental Council of India or the All India Council of Technical Education,” he said.
