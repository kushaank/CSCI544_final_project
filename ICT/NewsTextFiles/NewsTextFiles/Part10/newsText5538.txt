
After a successful first Downtown Easter Egg Hunt with more than 800 kids, Downtown Mesa Association took a hint: Fun, exciting kidsâ€™ events give downtown an opportunity to thrive.

The association is excited to announce that its Kidtastic events will continue weekly during the summer with new activities to entertain children during their break from school.

The next event, slated for May 21, will be held at Adorn Style Lounge, a combination boutique and hair salon on Main Street. Fun services for tots include $7 for braids, $10 for curls, $15 for dry cuts, $7 for nail polish, $5 for glitter tattoos, $5 edge ups (for boys), and $5 for color spray. Parents can get a mini-service, too.

Kidtastic started in 2013 with a series of summer events from cookie decorating to yoga. Once school started, the weekly events continued monthly.
