
With almost 30 years of professional experience in the fields of theatre, cinema and multimedia under his belt, director/producer Maurizio Mistretta has designed a workshop for serious students of acting who want to develop their techniques and explore a wider range of approaches to live performance and the creation of original work.

Participants will receive training in the classic methodology employed by the ancient Greeks as well as in more modern and contemporary approaches. These techniques and forms will include physical-based acting, postmodern dance, “commedia”, clowning, mask work, self-scripting and image-based original theatre, narrative acting, street theatre and methods used by Shakespeare. The creation and showing of original work are a significant part of the training encouraging participants to develop their own communication skills.
