Dear Friends of Haiti,

This year, we are celebrating the two hundred and eleventh anniversary of our flag's creation. I consider myself tremendously privileged to be with you, commemorating this extraordinary event which puts us in a place of distinction among the nations of the world. Today, let us set aside our worries in order to celebrate this great day in our history and that of mankind. On behalf of the Consulate General of Haiti and its staff, I wish you all a Happy Flag Day.

On January 18, 1804 (eighteen hundred and four), an historic meeting took place in Arcahaie. That meeting meant the beginning of the end of an era for the Americas and the world. From the tyrant's dreaded emblem, our ancestors managed to extract a precious symbolism which kept them united despite their numerous conflicts. Somehow, this flag may bring back unpleasant memories of our colonial past since it maintains the colors of France. However, in the eyes of our ancestors, the binding of the blue and the red represented the indispensable union that eventually led them to their hard earned final victory.

United behind this defiant flag, our ancestors fought valiantly. On the first day of January 1804, the first black nation of the New World was born. Paradoxically, our motto 'L'UNION FAIT LA FORCE' was borrowed from the French Revolution. However, it served our cause perfectly, and today more than ever, speaks to our reality.

At the dawn of the nineteenth century, our ancestors created this flag, and in so doing, handed a sound defeat to the enemies of freedom. But the enemies of freedom still exist.

Let us unite on behalf of the homeland !

Consul General"
