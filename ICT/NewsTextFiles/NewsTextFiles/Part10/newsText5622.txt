
DOVER – A sunny Sunday morning created a backdrop for men and women with trucks, American flags and flagpoles in Dover.

They were seen climbing those ladders and hanging the flags on telephone poles from Pine Hill Cemetery to Wentworth-Douglass Hospital.

Vaccher was joined alongside Central Avenue by Elks Bob and Sheila Libby. “We are headed up as far the hospital,” said Sheila, as she handed a tool to her husband who was on the ladder attaching a flag.

Everywhere throughout the Garrison City volunteers were seen and as passersby recognized their activity, horns were heard honking in gratitude and comments of thanks poured from car windows.

There were four groups traversing the central portion of Dover, mostly Elks who worked in the effort with members of the Dover City Lights Committee.

Participating for the first time this year were Janice Rosa-Miranda and her husband “Rosy” Rosa-Miranda. “We have lived here for 40 years,” said Janice, but were unable to help out before because we were always visiting our son, Air Force Lt. Colonel Lance Rosa-Miranda who is a fighter pilot stationed at Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico.
