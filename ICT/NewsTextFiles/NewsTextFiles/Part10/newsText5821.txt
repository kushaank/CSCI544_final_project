MADURAI: A man was arrested in Usilampatti in Madurai on Monday on charges of raping his daughter at a farmhouse.

Police said Subramani (44) of Kopilipatti near Usilampatti was a farm labourer. His daughter used to live in a government home for girls. Her mother had left her home following a fight with her husband. Subramani didn't allow her to take their daughter and admitted her to a childrens' home in Madurai .

Later, Subramani married another woman, with whom he had three daughters.

As his eldest daughter had completed her school education at the childrens' home, the authorities wrote to her father asking him to take her home. Once there, he convinced the girl that she would not be tortured by her step-mother and could stay with them. He also promised to get her admitted in a college for her higher studies.

Subramani took his daughter to his house and raped her repeatedly, police said.

On Monday morning, an elderly man had come to meet Subramani. On seeing him, his daughter spoke to him about her dad's misdeeds and sought help. The old man filed a police complaint. Based on this, Subramani was arrested. Initial investigations revealed that the girl was raped. Police are thinking of sending the girl for a  medical examination.
