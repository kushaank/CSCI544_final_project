
(ANSAmed) - ROME, MAY 19 - A key point on the agenda of the Italian semester of EU presidency will be the drive towards a joint immigration policy, Italy's Undersecretary for European Affairs, Sandro Gozi, told a forum at ANSA.

''A common policy on immigration and asylum is necessary as well as to go from national policies to an increasingly joint system'', Gozi said. ''This would help southern European countries, like Italy, and northern Europeans because the lack of a common policy means that many who arrive in southern Europe seek asylum in countries like Sweden. The needs are different but complementary''.

And the theme of immigration and asylum, on which European Mediterranean policies focus, will have two turning points at a European summit ending the Greek semester of EU presidency and at the Euro-African ministerial conference scheduled in Rome on November 26-27 during the Italian presidency, Gozi said.

"Greece worked well on the Mediterranean but we are waiting for the summit in June for an overall evaluation and then there will be a ministerial conference which we will host in Rome", said Gozi. "There, the key theme of a common policy on immigration and asylum will be confronted. There is a need to develop a partnership, connecting economic cooperation to mobility policies, with southern Mediterranean countries. But this partnership only works if the EU forges it as an entity and not as single states. It is a transnational theme and those thinking they can close down in their national short-sightedness and confront it alone are doomed to a grave failure".(ANSAmed).(ANSAmed).
