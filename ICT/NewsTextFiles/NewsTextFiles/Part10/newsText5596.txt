
At five pounds, four ounces and more than a month early, little Cali is more than just a surprise.

"It's a miracle! It's a miracle, definitely," said Cali's mom, Jennifer Maschmidt.

The Cape Coral mom says she was in Collier County Sunday for her baby shower.

She never made it -- because Cali wasn't waiting.

"I said you need to take me to the hospital right now," recalled Maschmidt.

Cali's father, Anthony Mendez, jumped in the driver's seat and headed toward North Collier Hospital.

"She started yelling, "She's coming!" explained Mendez. "I looked behind and I saw the head."

As fate would have it, they made it far enough to pull into Big Corkscrew Island Fire Station 10.

"The baby was on its way. We got everything as clean as possible with our sterile dressings and sheets out, and we delivered the baby right there in the back of the car," said Lt. Greg Pacter.

Cali's parents say those moments of truth are difficult to remember.

"It's such a blur to me because I was the one actually going through it," said Maschmidt.

"I wasn't really sure what was going on because I couldn't really get into the ambulance," added Mendez.

Paramedics rushed them to the hospital.

Twenty-four hours later, a happy healthy Cali smiled for the camera.

"It's a happy ending for everybody," said Capt. Eric Watson.

Lt. Pacter says he was simply doing his job.

"It's just a matter of being at the right place at the right time. We're here to help," he said.

Cali's mom and dad call him a hero.
