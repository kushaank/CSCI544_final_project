A car in Queens went onto the sidewalk and plowed into a man walking in a front yard early Monday morning, authorities said.

The car jumped the sidewalk in front of 49-33 Utopia Parkway at 5:40 a.m., when cops say the driver was cut off.

A man in his 60s was struck.

The man was rushed to Booth Memorial Hospital, where he was listed in critical condition with severe head trauma.

The driver remained on scene, and no criminality is suspected.

The Yankees are leading the Angels 6-5 in the ninth, but Mariano Rivera blows the save. Leave it to Jeter, who hits a walk-off single in the ninth inning for a 7-6 Yankees win.
