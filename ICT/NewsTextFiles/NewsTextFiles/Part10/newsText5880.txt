
A security guard at the Eurospar at Watch House Cross in Limerick, Ireland was assaulted with a hot cooked chicken in 2013. The chicken-thrower, John McNamara, was taken to court and now has been banned from the supermarket where the food-fight occurred.

According to the Limerick Leader , McNamara had denied assaulting security guard Marius Pogonowski.

Pogonowski was talking to McNamara’s daughter and her partner at the checkout of the store, the Court heard during a contested hearing. Then, McNamara came up to Pogonowski and started to act aggressively.

Others in the store got involved, with employee Beata Kaccewsta Wozny learning about the incident when she heard shouting.

This was confirmed with CCTV footage shown during the hearing. The video shows the fowl move, with McNamara’s family restraining him while he chucks the chicken.

But while giving evidence, McNamara said he wasn’t deliberately throwing it at Pogonowski. But, during the cross examination, he said he was a “small bit aggressive” and did throw the chicken because of his temper.

However, Judge Eugene O’Kelly said throwing in the fowl was a “potentially very dangerous act.” The chicken bag could have broken with Pogonowski getting scalded by the hot grease.

O’Kelly gave McNamara a four month prison sentence but suspended it for two years. McNamara has also been banned from that Eurospar.
