
An Iranian actress has been criticized by authorities in Tehran for kissing the president of the 67th Cannes Film Festival. Leila Hatami was photographed kissing 83-year-old Gilles Jacob on the cheek during a red-carpet ceremony in the French city.

According to Iran's interpretation of Shari'a law, a woman is not allowed to have physical contact with a man outside her family.

Iran's deputy culture minister, Hossein Noushabadi, said on May 18 that Hatami's "inappropriate presence" at the festival was not in line with Iran's religious beliefs.

Noushabadi said: "Those who attend international arenas as Iranian women should be careful about the chastity and dignity of Iranians so that the image of the Iranian woman is not tainted before the world."

Hatami is on the jury of the annual Cannes festival this year.
