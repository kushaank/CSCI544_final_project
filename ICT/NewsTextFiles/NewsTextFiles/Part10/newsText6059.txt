
KC Motorgoup Ltd. enjoyed strong pace at the two-race Super Formula event at Fuji Speedway, despite results not going their way.

KCMG driver Yuichi Nakayama ended both of Fridayâ€™s practice sessions in the top ten, taking the blue and white Dallara SF14 to a fastest time of 1:24.786 in the second session. He could not repeat his pace in qualifying, however, having to settle for 14th in race one and 11th in race 2 after failing to make it out of Q2.

Race one saw Nakayama make a brilliant start, picking off his rivals before a collision with Vitantonio Liuzzi caused a puncture and forced the rookie to make an unscheduled pit stop, costing valuable time. When back on track, Nakayama was right on the pace, logging the fifth fastest lap of the race, but could not work his way up through traffic and had to settle for 13th.

Nakayama showed yet more pace in race two, working his way towards the front before a slow pit stop and a stalled engine put him right back down the order and in the end came across the line in 16th.
