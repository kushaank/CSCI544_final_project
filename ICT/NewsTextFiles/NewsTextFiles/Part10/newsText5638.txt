
MEDICS saved the life of one of Scotland’s tiniest ever babies – by popping her into a £1 sandwich bag.

1lb 3oz – around the same as half a bag of sugar.

She was so premature she could have legally been aborted and was too small for a normal incubator.

But by being put in a resealable plastic bag – identical to those sold in supermarkets for £1 – doctors were able to nurture her to full health.

Emily was born on February 24 and her parents, Claire Cressey and Alan Coultas, have been told she will be allowed home on June 16 – the day she was due to be born.

Former care assistant Claire, 34, of Coldstream, Berwickshire, said: “It has been an emotional journey.

“Our world has been turned upside down and what should have been every new parent’s happiest moment became our worst nightmare.

“But Emily is finally out of the woods and it’s such a relief after everything we’ve been through.

COURTNEY SUMMERSGILL, 14, was bitten, beaten, spat on and left lying in the dirt for more than an hour following the unprovoked attack.
