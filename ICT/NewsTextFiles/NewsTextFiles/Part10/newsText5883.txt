
A Wexford man has been jailed for 12 years for raping his ex-partner's daughter in a case the DPP viewed as being on the 'severe end of the scale'.

The 40-year-old was convicted by a jury of 12 charges including eight charges of sex assault and one of rape in two locations in Waterford on dates between 2003 and 2008.

The man, who pleaded not guilty to all of the charges, can't be named to protect the identity of the now 17-year-old victim.

Mr Justice Patrick McCarthy imposed various sentences amounting to 12 years, suspending none of the term after noting "there was very little to be said in the manâ€™s favour".

The judge noted the "great resilience and strength of character" of the victim who now enjoys a healthy family life.
