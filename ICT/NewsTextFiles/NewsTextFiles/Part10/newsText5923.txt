Two maids and an Ethiopian man have been arrested on suspicion of stealing Dhs275,000 and mobile telephones from the house of an Iraqi man in Al Daraary area.

The Iraqi informed Al Gharb police station of the theft, saying he suspected his Ethiopian maid. She used to be trusted by the family and knew the place where they kept money and other valuables. She was found to have run away after the theft.

A team from the Criminal Investigation Department investigating the theft arrested the absconding maid. They also arrested a second maid, who worked for the family occasionally as a cleaner. Her working hours coincided with the Ethiopian maid’s and police thought she could also be involved.

While the Ethiopian maid initially denied stealing the money, the other woman confessed to having been involved. She said the money was stolen to get her back on their employer’s wife who was always fighting with her.

On searching her house, police found Dhs20,000 in addition to two of the three stolen mobiles. Asked about the remaining sum and the phone, she reportedly said she had handed them over to their third accomplice, who was to have smuggled them out. When the Ethiopian man was arrested, he denied involvement in the robbery, saying he was handed over the money by one of the maids.

The three suspects, currently detained, will be referred to the public prosecution.
