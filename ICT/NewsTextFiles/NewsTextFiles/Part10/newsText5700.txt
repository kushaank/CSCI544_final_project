
DENPASAR: An 84-year-old man could face death by firing squad after he was caught smuggling crystal methamphetamine worth about US$440,000 (RM1.4mil) into the Indonesian resort island of Bali from Kuala Lumpur, an official said Monday.

Arsain bin Anwar (pic), an Indonesian national who lives in Malaysia, was arrested on Friday with 2.5kg of the drug in his luggage, airport customs chief I Made Wijaya said.

Under Indonesia's tough anti-drugs laws, he could face the death penalty if convicted of smuggling that quantity of drugs, he said.

However Anwar claimed he had no idea he was transporting drugs and was paid only RM200 to carry the package, the official said.

"He said that someone he knew asked him to deliver the package and that he thought it was full of clothes," Wijaya told AFP.

According to Wijaya, Anwar said he only accepted the money because his wife was ill and he needed to cover medical costs.

Anwar, who is originally from East Java province in western Indonesia, had been working in Malaysia for 30 years as a car washer.

He arrived in Bali on a Malindo Air flight from Kuala Lumpur, said the official.

The drugs have a street value of five billion rupiah (RM1.4mil), said Wijaya. He added that customs officials received intelligence that Anwar may be carrying drugs before his arrest.

"There was another man implicated in a suspected ring on the flight, but he slipped past customs. Police are searching for him," he said.

Several foreign convicted traffickers are in jail in Bali, including British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford.
