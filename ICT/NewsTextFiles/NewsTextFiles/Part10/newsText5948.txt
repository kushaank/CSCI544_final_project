SYRACUSE, N.Y.-- A recent United Nations report says 33 million people were displaced in 2013 by violence. According to the UN, a refugee is anyone who is displaced from their home by conflict or violence.

"People become refugees for various categories of reason, they may become stateless, their country may disappear, they may become a refugee because of what they believe, their political beliefs, their religious beliefs, they can become a refugee because of ethnic cleansing," said Helen Malina, the director of InterFaith Works Center for New Americans.

Many end up in living in refugee camps, and face up to 17 years for resettlement in many cases. But when a refugee is finally cleared, the highest number end up in the United States, and Syracuse has emerged as a prime city for resettlement.

Experts say that's because of New York State's robust public assistance programs and a combination of Syracuse's relatively low cost of living and inviting community.

"We really are a welcoming city and I think most of the communities that have been resettled here have been well integrated into the Syracuse community family," said Malina.

Out of the approximately 70,000 refugees that come to the United States every year, Central New York receives about 1,200 of them. About half of those are helped by the InterFaith Works Center for New Americans. The center helps refugees find homes and jobs, learn English and adjust to American society. However, the transition can be a difficult one.

"When we arrived here we really challenged some barriers, like the language and cultural barriers, my wife has no English, my kids they have no English, even when I headed to Syracuse I had never heard about Syracuse before," said Harith Alnoamy, an Iraqi refugee.

For many people, their journey is helped by their fellow countrymen who have come before them. A group of Sudanese refugees meets every week for church and socializing, and they say it brings a little piece of home to Syracuse.

"That is our culture, coming together, gathering together, that is our culture back home, nobody will be alone, but we come together as brothers and as sisters," said Aaron Limmo, a Sudanese refugee.

It's all about brothers and sisters navigating their complicated American dreams, one day at a time.

UN officials say the number of displaced people has hit record-high numbers in the past two years, and that number is only expected to grow as the conflict in Syria forces a family out of their home approximately every 60 seconds.
