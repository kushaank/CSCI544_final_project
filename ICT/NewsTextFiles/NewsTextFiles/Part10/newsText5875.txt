DUBLIN--Ireland's European and local elections on Friday pose a serious midterm test for the two-party coalition led by Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny--its first since it swept to power at the height of the country's crisis more than three years ago.

Ireland has been hailed by the European Union as the poster child for austerity and its exit from its three-year bailout in December cited as proof for what compliant countries can achieve. However, two weekend opinion polls suggest disenchanted voters are far less impressed by Europe's austerity prescription and will give the Irish government a severe bloody nose in the European and local elections.

The separate polls for the Sunday Times and the Sunday Independent newspapers suggest voters are turning sharply toward parties, such as Sinn Féin and other independent candidates, that voters most identify for trenchant opposition to austerity measures. Despite signs that Ireland has weathered the worst of its huge banking debt crisis that brought the country close to bankruptcy six years ago, support for the coalition has fallen, the polls suggest. There is strong evidence that employment is growing rapidly again, but with unemployment and emigration still at elevated levels, austerity taxes and large household debts, a legacy of the banking bust, continue to weigh on voters.

Experts say that the outcome of the elections on May 23 could strain relations between Mr. Kenny's Fine Gael, a right-of-center party, and its junior coalition partner, Labour, a left-of-center party led by Deputy Prime Minister Eamon Gilmore. At the early 2011 parliamentary elections, the parties won a huge combined vote of 56%, but opinion polls now suggest that Labour, in particular, is suffering a slump in support.

The Behaviour & Attitudes poll for The Sunday Times says that Labour could win none of the 11 seats being contested across three large constituencies that will return lawmakers to represent Ireland in the European Parliament following Friday's elections. Labour will also perform badly in Ireland's local elections that take place on the same day, the poll suggests, with much of its support seeping to the left-wing Sinn Féin party, led by Gerry Adams. The second-largest opposition party in the Irish Parliament, Sinn Féin is on course to win three of the 11 European seats countrywide, and will likely top the European poll in the capital, the Sunday Times says. While the poll indicates that Mr. Kenny's Fine Gael will win the largest number of European seats, its vote will likely fall substantially. The B&A opinion poll of more than 500 voters in each of the three European constituencies has a 4.5% margin of error.

In the local elections, the newspaper suggests that Fine Gael has the support of 25% of voters, down seven percentage points from the previous local elections in 2009, while support for Labour has more than halved to 7%. Sinn Féin's support has risen 10 percentage points to 17%, while the independents and other parties have surged 13 points to 30%. This B&A poll of more than 1,500 voters has an error margin of 2.6%.

A poll by Millward Brown published in the weekend editions of the Irish Independent and Sunday Independent also suggests Sinn Féin and other antiausterity candidates are poised to win support. In the capital, with 23% of the vote, Sinn Féin candidate Lynn Boylan will top the European poll in the Dublin constituency on Friday, according to the poll. Fine Gael's Brian Hayes, the deputy finance minister who is contesting a European seat, with 22% of the vote, is also on course to win one of the three European seats in Dublin, but with independents also doing well, the poll suggests that junior coalition party Labour will struggle to win any seat in its Dublin stronghold. The poll has an error margin of 4.3%.

The polls suggest support for Sinn Féin hasn't been hit by the arrest in early May of Mr. Adams by Northern Ireland police investigating the murder of Jean McConville by the Irish Republican Army during the conflict in Northern Ireland. Mr. Adams, who played a large role in Northern Ireland's peace process, was released without charge. He has repeatedly denied any role in the 1972 killing and has consistently denied he was ever a member of the IRA.

Irish voters appear to be kicking back at the notion it is the poster child for austerity in Europe, said Theresa Reidy, a political scientist at University College Cork. "The Irish were responsible for a large part of their own crisis, but they have also felt that the European institutions were unprepared for the Irish crisis, and reacted badly, and bear some of the responsibility for the way the banking crisis was managed," Ms. Reidy said.
