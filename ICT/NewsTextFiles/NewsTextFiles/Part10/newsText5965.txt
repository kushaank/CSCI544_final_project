
[Executive Office of Public Safety and Security spokesman Terrel Harris] said it appears that "extreme force against the bottom of the door actually broke the fasteners and the metal back-up safety system that held the doors in place."

Harris added that "the doors were forced from the bottom to swing into the elevator shaft, which created the gap that the victim fell through."

The Globe identified the victim as Lizzy Scotland of Brigantine, N.J. Scotland fell from the fourth floor doorway onto the top of the elevator, which was stopped on the second floor. She was seriously injured in the fall and rushed to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for treatment. At the time, officials called the fall an accident .

The force required to damage the door was substantial, according to WCVB.

"A force in excess of 225 foot pounds was applied to the bottom section of the door, so the door actually swung into the shaft like a pendulum," said Massachusetts Public Safety Commissioner Thomas Gatzunis said.

*Correction: An earlier version of this story indicated “the doors to a Fenway Park elevator had been damaged before a woman fell two stories down the shaft.” Exactly what happened remains unclear.
