
DALLAS -- Police say the man who was naked when he dove through a car's open sunroof before assaulting the female driver has been formally charged with assault.

It happened Friday evening near the corner of Zang Boulevard and Oakenwald Street in Oak Cliff.

From his apartment balcony, neighbor Marcus Payne shot video of Nicholas Dyll, 23, as he sat naked in the street below. Payne thought he was capturing the craziest thing he’d ever seen — until Dyll came back into frame.

Nude and with no fear, Dyll slid arms-first into the open sunroof of a woman’s car.

"A naked man jumped in," she told us, asking us to protect her identity. "He jumped in my car and he started attacking me."

Her emotional wounds are still raw.

"He started choking me, pulling my hair, pulling my eyes, and I couldn’t do anything," she said.

As he clawed at her, the car skidded. Dallas police were there and tried to call Dyll off her, until they crashed.

"I don’t know how much longer that attack would have lasted if [the police] weren’t there," the woman said.

Dyll left in handcuffs for the hospital. Officers suspect he was on drugs.

The victim's car has $3,000 worth of damage she’ll have to pay for herself, but that’s not the worst part.

"I feel more afraid, more aware of everything around me…like a prisoner," she said.

On Thursday, police confirmed that Dyll had been arrested and charged with Class A assault and felony criminal mischief.

By Friday he had been released on bond.
