
The number of Syrian refugees in Jordan has reached almost 600,000 as about 400 Syrians cross into Jordan on most days, with the figure reaching the low thousands whenever fighting intensifies.

With the Syrian conflict showing no signs of abating, the refugee crisis drags on, the Red Cross said on Sunday.

Almost 80 per cent of the Syrian refugees in Jordan live outside camps, within host communities, which puts pressure on local educational and health facilities, on the electricity and water networks and on other infrastructure.

Together with the Jordan National Red Crescent Society, the ICRC has been providing cash assistance for Syrian households in northern Jordan to help them meet their basic needs.

"For most refugees residing in host communities, the major challenge is to pay for basic living costs, including rent, food and medication," said Catherine Gendre, head of the ICRC delegation in Jordan.

The majority of Syrian refugees cross into Jordan through the north-eastern border. They arrive, with few if any belongings, in a hostile desert far from any urban services. Once they are in Jordan, they are initially accommodated at ICRC-sponsored temporary transit facilities where their basic needs are attended to.

Border Guards Forces then assist the newly arriving Syrians at six facilities along the border where shelter, water, generators and basic medical items are provided by the ICRC.
