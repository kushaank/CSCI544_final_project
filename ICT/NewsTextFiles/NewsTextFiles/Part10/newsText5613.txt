
UPPER PROVIDENCE � It is a rare event to hear so much thunder when it is 70 degrees outside and the sun is shining. On the third Sunday in May over the past 17 years, however, it happens during the Rolling Thunder Pennsylvania Chapter 1 �Day with a Vet� motorcycle parade and picnic.

Members of Rolling Thunder chapters from across the region, veterans and the community at large met in the Lowes Parking Lot in Oaks on Sunday to take a ride, escorted by the Plymouth Police, through Oaks, Norristown, Conshohocken and Downingtown on the way to their final destination � a picnic at the Coatesville Veterans Affairs Medical Center.

The group thundered off towards Pawlings Road, where they were saluted by a large American Flag suspended over the road between the extended ladders of Black Rock Volunteer Fire Department Tower 99 and Ladder 77. Another salute was set up along Main Street on the way to Norristown.

�Seventeen years ago we decided we wanted to have a ride to Coatesville,� said Vice President Mike Hunsberger of Rolling Thunder Chapter 1 Pennsylvania.

When the parade arrived at the hospital, the community enjoyed burgers, hotdogs, beverages and music provided by Voodoo Deville. All money from the 50/50 raffle also goes to the veteran�s hospital. Over the years, Hunsberger said, Rolling Thunder has been able to raise enough funds through the parade and picnic to buy two transport vehicles.

According to the Rolling Thunder Pennsylvania Chapter 1 website, Rolling Thunder is a non-profit organization dedicated to educating the public about American prisoners of war, to help correct the past and to protect future veterans from being left behind, should they become prisoners of war or missing in action.

Under the leadership of Sergeant Joe Fraoili, members of the Frankford High School ROTC Color Guard Greg Torres, Kevin Juarez and Kevin Olsen led the ceremonies before the motorcycles made their way to the picnic. While Torres hoisted the American Flag, the gathered crowd said the Pledge of Allegiance and sang the National Anthem.

Vereb, clad in a leather jacket, brought his new Harley Davidson Road King Police Edition to join in the parade.
