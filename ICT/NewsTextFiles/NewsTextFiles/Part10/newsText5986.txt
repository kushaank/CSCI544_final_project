
Justice Minister thumbs her nose at critics, insists continuing negotiations is the 'responsible' thing to do.

peace talks collapsed Monday, in a move that drew sharp criticism from ministers.

Livni came under fire for holding talks in London with Abbas on Thursday, with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's office and ministers distancing themselves from the meeting, insisting it was private and did not signal official intention to resume talks.

"To all those politicians up in arms, I want to be clear: we'll continue doing what we believe in, and that's what I did last week by meeting [Abbas]," Livni said.

On Saturday, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu  distanced himself  from the meeting between Livni and Abbas, which was held on Thursday.

Sources in the prime minister's office said that Netanyahu made it clear to Livni that she would be representing only herself, and not the Israeli government.

The prime minister reiterated that the position of the government, as passed unanimously by the security cabinet, is not to negotiate with a "Palestinian government" that includes Hamas, which he restated is "a terrorist organization that declares its intentions to destroy the state of Israel."
