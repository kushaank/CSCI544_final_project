
Speaker Edelstein officially announces the date for the poll. Shalom candidacy appears more likely.

Knesset Speaker MK Yuli Edelstein (Likud-Beytenu) finished the consultation process regarding election of a new president on Monday, and officially announced June 10 as the date on which MKs will select President Shimon Peres's successor.

The vote is supposed to be carried out no later than a month before mid-July, when the present president's term expires.

Earlier reports said that Edelstein would consult with the Knesset Secretariat and announce a date somewhere between June 10 and June 18.

The final date for submitting candidacy to the post is ten days before the election. That makes June 8, the last day in which candidacy can be announced.
