
NEW DELHI: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and French President Francois Hollande called up PM-designate Narendra Modi on Monday.

Assuring him of his "commitment to the strategic partnership and friendship between France and India," Hollande invited Modi to France. France wants to kick off engagement with the new government early, with French foreign minister Laurent Fabius scheduled to make a trip here in June.

Abe also congratulated Modi on his electoral victory. Modi has traveled several times to Japan and plans to involve Tokyo in a big way in India's development agenda.

While Modi received a congratulatory letter from Singaore PM Lee Hsien Loong, a letter he would cherish came from former PM Goh Chok Tong, who, many say, influenced Modi's world vision. In his letter Goh said, "I recall our meetings and frank exchange of views since 2006 when I visited Gujarat. You have always shown a strong resolve to bring economic prosperity to the Indian people.... I am confident that you will lead India to greater heights as Prime Minister, and further build on the excellent ties between our two countries."

On Saturday, Modi received a congratulatory message from the Canadian prime minister, as well as the high commissioner, Stewart Beck. "I had the pleasure to meet with Modi during his time as the Chief Minister of Gujarat and I look forward to working with him to grow Canada's bilateral relationship with India," he said.
