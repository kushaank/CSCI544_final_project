
And so it begins: the seemingly endless round of legal maneuvering over another potential death-penalty case, although this time the spectacle is occurring in Denver rather than Arapahoe County.

Those who follow local news are well-acquainted with the blizzard of motions filed over the past year in the runup to the trial of alleged Aurora theater shooter James Holmes.

Now a similar process is apparently underway in the trial of Dexter Lewis, who could face the death penalty if convicted of stabbing five people to death in a Denver bar.

On Monday, Lewis' attorneys asked the judge to declare the death penalty unconstitutional because of how it is applied. And that's only one of many objections to capital punishment we're almost certain to see before this process is over.

Proponents of the death penalty rarely acknowledge how costly and time-consuming its sporadic enforcement has become. And yet a life sentence without possibility of parole remains the just and logical alternative.
