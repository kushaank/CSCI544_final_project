
The University of Hawai`i at Hilo has received a $500,000 gift from Hilo dentist and UH Manoa faculty member Patsy Fujimoto to establish an endowment honoring former UH Hilo History Professor David Purcell.

The David C. Purcell, Jr. Endowed Visiting Chair in History Fund in the College of Arts and Sciences will enable the department to bring Distinguished historians to campus, and increase the amount of expertise in American, Asia/Pacific and European history, as well as in other fields of history.

Purcell joined the UH Hilo faculty in 1970 where he taught courses in the history of Japan, China and Oceania until his retirement in 2001. He is a recipient of the Board of Regents Excellence in Teaching Award, and he served as Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at UH Hilo from 1976-1983.

While attending UH Hilo, Dr. Fujimoto took many classes in Asian history from Purcell and applies the life lessons she gleaned from his classroom to her own teaching today.

"UH Hilo is grateful to Dr. Fujimoto for her generosity in establishing this endowment, said Chancellor Donald Straney. Knowledge of history enriches our communities and strengthens society, and Im pleased the inspiration Dr. Purcell imparted to his student years ago will benefit UH Hilo students for years to come."
