
Anti-Semitic hate cartoon published in Hamas official daily newspaper as threats of genocide against Jews continue.

The cartoon, captioned "Israel is preparing to accept waves of Jewish immigration from France and Ukraine," features a number of anti-Semitic stereotypes. In it, hooked-nosed and bearded Jews march toward Israel, with their wives and children in tow; Israel is portrayed as a grave.

The cartoon intends to scare away new immigrants, as well as threaten all Jews living in Israel with genocide.

Hamas has been stepping up its threats of genocide over the past several weeks.

Hamas recently "celebrated" Israel's 66th Independence Day with a genocide-themed video.The song in the video was to the tune of the Israeli national anthem, Hatikvah, which means “the hope” in Hebrew.
