
OSAKA (TR) – A medical center revealed on Thursday that it has disciplined a female nurse at a local hospital for working part-time at a sex club, reports the Mainichi Shimbun (May 16).

The Osaka Medical Center and Research Institute for Maternal and Child Health, located in Izumi City, announced a one-month suspension from work for a 24-year-old nurse who was also employed at a “ fashion health ” club in Osaka’s Ward between August of last year and April.

The nurse was accused of violating internal regulations regarding side employment.

The matter came to light in early April, when the center received an anonymous tip regarding the women’s side work.

A fashion health establishment typically offers oral sex as administered by masseuses attired in uniforms. The nurse reportedly received 1.4 million yen during her employment at the club.
