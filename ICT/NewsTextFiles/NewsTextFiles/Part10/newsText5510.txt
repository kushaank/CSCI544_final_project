
HILL COUNTY - McLennan County Deputies made two arrests Sunday night in connection with a Hill County home invasion and burglary of a couple in their 60s. Both victims were transported to Hillcrest Baptist Medical Center, where the man remains in the ICU.

Danny Joe Weir and Michael Lee Rhodes currently face a charge of burglary of a habitation, with intent to commit another felony.

The burglary occurred around 2:30 a.m. Friday, May 16, on Hill County Road 2200 outside Aquilla. Authorities say the couple were awakened by their dogs barking. They got up to investigate, and found the dogs had someone at bay in a bathroom or closet.

The 68-year-old resident got his gun, but the suspects came out and rushed him.

Hill County Sheriff Michael Cox says, "At one point the husband had the suspects at gun point, but they were able to overpower him and take the weapon."

Authorities say the man was severely beaten with a club, and the suspects beat the 63-year-old woman with their fists.

The victims were able to call a ranch hand as the two men were leaving, who fired shots at the men as they fled, but did not hit either suspect.

Cox says, "The person who recovered the purse from the dumpster called the McLennan County Sheriff's Office so a deputy arrived, and when he arrived he noticed a vehicle matching the description of the one that was used in the home invasion."

Several people were interviewed, one confessed, and by Sunday night, Weir and Rhodes were behind bars.

Cox says, "It's nice when we can work together and solve a case and that's what happened on this case.  It was a good team effort and we're able to put the bad guys in jail and that's what we want."
