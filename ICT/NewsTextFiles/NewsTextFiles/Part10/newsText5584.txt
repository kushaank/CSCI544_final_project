The police said that Jamaluddin married  Gulshan Bano about four year's back. A dispute arose between the couple about two years back and Jamaluddin allegedly ousted his wife and daughter from the house. Gulshan shifted to her parents' house and also lodged a case under the Dowry Act against her husband.

On Monday, Gulshan and her sister Reshma left home to appear in Kamil exam (madarsa). As the duo reached Mauaima Bazaar, they were intercepted by Jamaluddin and his accomplices. He asked Gulshan to withdraw the case and threatened of dire consequences. When she refused to heed to the demand, Jamaluddin threw acid on the faces of the two girls and escaped from the scene.

The police maintained that the accused had targeted his sister-in-law  Reshma Bano and Gulshan suffered burns in a bid to save her sister. Following the incident, a case under Section 326 of the IPC was lodged against Jamaluddin of Mauaima. A police team has been constituted to crack down the incident.

Earlier this month, twenty-seven-year-old  Sushila had succumbed to burns suffered during an acid attack. According to reports, she was sleeping along with her three-year-old son outside her house in Leelakurd village under  Sarayinayat police station, when a jilted lover poured acid on the duo. While Sushila died during treatment, her son is said to be in stable condition.
