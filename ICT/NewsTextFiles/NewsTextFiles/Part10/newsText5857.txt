
Software-defined networking (SDN) is transforming the global technology landscape and Ireland is well placed to capture economic value and jobs, the IDA said today.

IDA Ireland’s divisional manager in charge of ICT Leo Clancy spoke ahead of the Open Networking Foundation’s co-hosting of Open Tech Ireland: An SDN Gathering on 30 June at Royal Hospital Kilmainham in Dublin.

The Open Networking (ONF) was founded to promote SDN and OpenFlow, marketing the use of cloud computing before it became popular.

SDN is an approach to computer networking that evolved out of California universities UC Berkley and Stanford University, that simplifies networking.

“SDN is transforming the global technology landscape and will generate huge future economic value and jobs. Ireland is very well placed to play a significant part in this SDN revolution,” Clancy said.

In addition to ONF and IDA Ireland, Open Tech Ireland: An SDN Gathering is being presented in co-operation with the Irish Software Association , Intune Networks , KEMP Technologies , and Sanctum Networks . The symposium is designed to be a gathering of international SDN luminaries, Irish companies already on the leading edge of SDN, employees of multinational companies with facilities in Ireland, and energetic entrepreneurs and investors.

Attendees will participate in a one-day exchange of ideas and updates, including an event programme featuring presentations from network operators, early innovators, and funding sources.

“The global SDN movement has made significant strides in recent years,” said Dan Pitt, executive director of the ONF.

“The shift from hardware to software represents the biggest change in networking in a generation and will ultimately benefit everyone.
