
A fisherman was rescued yesterday after a farmer heard his cry for help a half a mile out to sea.

John Grant was tending to his sheep at Tullagh Bay on the coast of the Inishowen Peninsula in Co Donegal.

Mr Grant suddenly heard a cry for help and noticed a spec in the distance and realised it was a person hanging onto a buoy.

The farmer contacted his mother and she alerted Malin Head Coastguard at around 1.50pm.

They alerted Greencastle Coastguard and the Lough Swilly lifeboat.

The rescue 118 helicopter from Sligo was also scrambled to the scene.

Weather conditions at the time of the rescue were calm but it was raining heavily.

The Lough Swilly lifeboat attended the scene, by which time a local boat had already picked up the man.

The man, a local lobster fisherman in his 40s, was wrapped in blankets and given attention.

A medic from the 118 helicopter was dropped at the scene and a decision was made to take the man to the shore near Clonmany by boat.

Once on shore the helicopter flew the man to Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry where he is understood to be in a stable condition.

A Lough Swilly Lifeboat spokesman praised the actions of Mr Grant saying they sparked a very successful rescue. He said it was “simply amazing” he heard the man’s cry for help so far out to sea.
