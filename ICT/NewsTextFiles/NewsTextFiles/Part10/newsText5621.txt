
"The hospital's nursing department has long had thoughts about using flight attendant style service for the patients but it never materialised," head nurse Bu Haijuan told reporters.

Initially, there were concerns that the program would get negative press, but the hospital moved forward with the idea this past March.

According to the Chinese media, the concept was to improve the quality of nursing at the hospital. Flight attendants are seen to have good manners, and this hospital hopes that those manners will help make the patients' experience better.

This wasn't an easy program to make happen.

"It was a surprise to us that only three nurses signed up for this at the get go. I guess many of the nurses lacked self confidence as the selection process was known to be rigorous," said Bu.

The other nine were selected by their age, height, and appearance. It's not exactly clear whether or not those flight attendants, I mean nurses, actually had a right of refusal.

"While all twelve nurses still haven't perfected the mannerisms of flight attendants," said the head nurse, "they do look like them."
