
The Consumer Guidance Society of India (CGSI) plans to take the State Government to task for permitting the sale of loose edible oils till December this year, despite the food authority banning the same.

Since January this year, CGSI has been collecting samples of loose oil being sold in various parts of the city, Navi Mumbai and Thane. Subsequently, on testing 22 samples, it was found that 20 of them were adulterated.

The Food Safety Standard Authority of India (FSSAI) had announced the ban on sale of loose edible oil in 2012. But, in October 2013, the Maharashtra Government passed a notification permitting the sale till this year end, stating that it would affect small traders who lacked adequate infrastructure and back-up.

CGSI Chairperson Sitaram Dixit, who initiated the campaign, said, "FSSAI imposed the ban due to safety issues, but unfortunately the Maharashtra Government's notification allows traders to sell edible oil in loose form." CGSI now plans to get the remaining samples tested soon.
