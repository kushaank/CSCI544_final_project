HONG KONG (AP) â€” Thailand's stock market and currency fell Tuesday after the military declared martial law in what it called an attempt to stabilize the country's precarious political situation.

The benchmark SET index in Bangkok dropped 1 percent to 1,397.48. The dollar spiked to about 32.65 baht before easing to about 32.50 baht.

Bangkok remained calm after Thailand's military took control of public security nationwide, surrounding police headquarters in the capital as they broadcast the announcement before dawn from multiple television stations. It requested TV channels run by opposing political camps to suspend broadcasts.

The move, which the military insists is not a coup, follows months of anti-government demonstrations and a refusal by the caretaker prime minister to step down.

The unrest has hurt the Thai economy, which shrank 2.1 percent in the first quarter from the fourth quarter, according to data released Monday.

"The last thing the economy needs is further political instability," said Michael Every, head of Asia Pacific financial market research at Rabobank. He said that "martial law will almost certainly hit near-term tourism arrivals."
