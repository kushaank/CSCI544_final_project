
GardaÃ­ from several districts, including an armed response unit, had to be called early this morning after an armed man robbed a petrol station and made his way towards the town centre in Clonmel.

The incident happened at about 4.30am when a man in his 20s arrived at the hatch at the AppleGreen service station in the Greenane area of Clonmel, close to the Dungarvan Road, and threatened staff with a weapon.

After taking cigarettes from the business, he made his escape on foot and headed in the direction of the centre of Clonmel.

Staff at the petrol station immediately raised the alarm and gardaÃ­ in the town requested assistance from units in Cahir and Carrick-on-Suir as well as the armed regional response unit from Thurles and the local patrol.

Four main junctions in the town were sealed off by gardaÃ­ in an attempt to keep the streets clear as the incident unfolded and the raider was observed as he approached the main commercial area of the town, pointing what appeared to be a handgun at gardaÃ­.

He was eventually arrested on Sarsfield Street, between the river Suir and OâConnell Street, and taken to the local garda station where he remains for questioning under Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act.

Itâs understood the suspect is a local man.

GardaÃ­ have thanked local businesspeople, including taxi drivers, for their help in clearing the streets while the incident was under way. âWe want to thank everyone for their support in helping to bring this to a safe conclusion,â said a spokesman.

The AppleGreen station is currently closed while members of the garda technical bureau carry out a forensic examination of the scene, but it is expected to re-open later today.
