
Patna: As the political drama unfolds in Bihar, the big question is whether Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will take back his resignation. The Janata Dal United legislature is meeting on Monday to discuss the ongoing situation after Nitish said that he would re-think his decision.

However, JDU chief Sharad Yadav has said that the decision of Nitish quitting is final. "The decision (Nitish Kumar's resignation) is in favor of the nation, the party and Nitish ji. It was a difficult decision but is final and right," he said.

Two JDU MLAs also say that Nitish should resign. JDU MLA Anirudh Yadav said, "Nitish Kumar should resign. MLAs are being forced to support Nitish Kumar. The JDU may lose the floor test in the Assembly if Nitish is re-elected."

Sources have told CNN-IBN that Nitish held meetings with his close aides on Sunday night. There is a clear rift within the party with sources saying that Nitish is upset with JDU President Sharad Yadav reaching out to RJD Chief Lalu Prasad for a secular alliance.

A section of the party is miffed with Sharad Yadav and does not want Bijender Yadav to be Nitish's successor because he is considered close to Sharad Yadav. A few party leaders feel that Sharad Yadav couldn't get votes from his own Yadav community which backed Lalu.

Nitish had on Sunday said that he would re-think the decision to resign after JDU MLAs protested, asking him to reconsider.
