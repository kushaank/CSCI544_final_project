
An Iraqi national was released on Monday evening after a three-day kidnap ordeal in the Bekaa town of Brital, reported the state-run National News Agency.

"An army force raided locations where fugitives were staying in Brital and managed to free Majed al-Nashi,” the NNA said.

Al-Nashi, who is the son-in-law of businessman Wael al-Jabouri, was kidnapped at midnight on Thursday while transporting USD 50,000 in ransom to his kidnappers-to be, to secure the release of al-Jabouri's abducted relative, the NNA detailed.

"But he was himself abducted at the entrance of the Hosh al-Nabi town in Baalbek as he was delivering the ransom money,” the same source added.

Army troops then positioned near the suspects' residences, and the Airborne Regiment carried out raids in the area to free the Iraqi national.

The kidnappers were identified as M.Y.M. And H.T.M, revealed the NNA.

This comes as army troops and security forces have been implementing a security plan since April in the North, the Bekaa and Beirut.

The plan has so far succeeded in the arrest of dozens of fugitives throughout Lebanon, and in seizing a number of stolen vehicles and illegal substance.
