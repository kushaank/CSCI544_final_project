An ambulance was involved in a rollover accident on Pontiac�s southeast side on Saturday while en route to a call, sending three people to the hospital.

The Star EMS ambulance was responding to a call with its lights and siren on at about 3 p.m. when the accident occurred at Whittemore Street and Sanford Street, said Star EMS President and CEO Bill Grubb.

A black Dodge Charger sedan struck the ambulance�s front end, and it rolled onto the driver�s side.

No patients were in the ambulance at the time. The occupants of the ambulance weren�t seriously injured, and Grubb said it�s his understanding that the driver of the Charger wasn�t seriously hurt, either.

Star EMS transported both the two people in the rolled ambulance and the driver of the Charger to the hospital.

The Waterford Regional Fire Department�s Engine 7 responded to the scene. Waterford Fire Capt. John Lyman said the accident is being investigated by the Oakland County Sheriff�s Office.

A command sergeant at the sheriff�s office couldn�t be reached for comment late Saturday.

Grubb said Star EMS, which provides ambulance service in Pontiac , has a good safety record. He said Saturday�s accident is a reminder of the dangers first responders face.
