
"We will continue to contribute positive energy to pushing forward the negotiations," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said in a press briefing in Beijing on Monday.

He further noted that Beijing hopes that Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the United States, China, Russia, France and Britain - plus Germany continue their talks based on an equal footing, and accommodate each other's concerns.

Given the sensitivity and complexity of some issues, the negotiations will not always run smoothly, Hong said, adding that all sides have shown sincerity to reach a deal to fully resolve the decade-old dispute over Tehran's nuclear energy program at an early date.

Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has expressed optimism that the ongoing nuclear negotiations with the world powers will result in a final agreement.

"Despite the existing difficulties, Iran's talks with the P5+1 (permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany) shall, God willing, ultimately reach an agreement, because agreement and a win-win game are in everyone's interest," Rouhani said at a Monday meeting with a group of Iranian officials.

Rouhani stressed that Tehran has "never sought to lie" to the world, adding, "The objective of the Islamic Republic of Iran has been [to attain] peaceful nuclear technology and it will follow that and pursue the people's right; however, in the course of the talks it wants to achieve a mutual understanding that is beneficial to all."

Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif stated on Sunday that a comprehensive nuclear deal between Iran and the six world powers is "possible" if the parties to the talks with the Islamic Republic do away with "illusions."

Iran and the six countries have been discussing ways to iron out differences and start drafting a final deal that would end the West's dispute with Iran over the country's nuclear energy program.

In November 2013, the two sides signed an interim nuclear deal in the Swiss city of Geneva that came into force on January 20.
