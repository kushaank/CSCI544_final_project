NATO is set to leave, and they have sworn to continue their bloody campaign until their version of Shariah is not enforced throughout the country. The toxic narrative, shoved down our throats by parties of God who couldn’t care less about humans and humans who couldn’t care more about themselves, has been proven completely false and devoid of any valid foundation, ironically by doing exactly what they proposed so passionately. Yet, they remain insistent and unashamed. Pushing us to take another step forward, claiming that the deep ditch right before us, is in fact not there at all. On the edge, between the long fall and those cheering us to jump from behind, Pakistan stands still. But when you have come such a long way at the behest of the foolish and the malicious, even a gust of wind is sometimes enough to throw you off balance and down you go, robbed of the opportunity to make that final call. Turn around and return while there is still time.
