
TRICHY: Twenty-two workers were injured on Monday when they fell from a metal scaffolding which was erected at the St Mary's Cathedral Church at Melapudhur. Labourers were hurt after they fell from a height of over 60 feet as the scaffolding on which they were standing collapsed. The injured are now admitted at the  Government Hospital in Trichy.

The injured are mostly migrant labourers from West Bengal. A few are from nearby villages in Trichy district.

The incident occurred at 4.15pm when the labourers were working on the interior designs at the top of the church. The construction of a new church has been ongoing for two years after the demolition of a 173-year-old structure.

A fire and rescue team was deployed to extricate the workers from the debris before they were rushed to the hospital in four ambulances. A Syed Mohammed Shah,  divisional forest officer, inspected the entire premises and said no there are no major casualties.

Doctors at the government hospital said workers were being treated for fractures and abrasions. A man who witnessed the incident, Thangaraj S from Viralimalai, said most labourers were wearing safety helmets and thus could escape major injuries despite the fall from a great height.

B Ravishankar, district manager, 108 ambulances, said the GPS system installed in the ambulances also came in handy to reach the spot from Karur with ease. An ambulance that arrived at the hospital with a a patient was soon put to use and sent to ferry all the injured to the hospital.

The famous  Melapudhur Church attracts a large number of devotees from the region.

Church authorities said the new structure that is being built is 125 feet high from the ground to the top of the bell. The re-construction is done in such a way that the church will be visible from several places in Trichy.
