
DENPASAR (AFP) - An 84-year-old man could face death by firing squad for smuggling crystal methamphetamine worth more than 5 billion rupiah (S$550,000) into the Indonesian resort island of Bali, an official said Monday.

Arsain bin Anwar, an Indonesian national who lives in Malaysia, was arrested on Friday with 2.5kg of the drug in his luggage, airport customs chief I Made Wijaya said.

Under Indonesia's tough anti-drugs laws, he could face the death penalty if convicted of smuggling that quantity of drugs, he said.
