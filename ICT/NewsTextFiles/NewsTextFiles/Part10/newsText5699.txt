Joko Widodo, the man most likely to become Indonesia's next president, has gone back to the future in his choice of running mate.

Joko Widodo, the man most likely to become Indonesia's next president, has gone back to the future in his choice of running mate.

Jusuf Kalla, 72, served as vice-president in the first term of  Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, between 2004 and 2009. He will add age, experience, parliamentary clout and regional variety to the candidacy of the relatively youthful Mr Joko, 52.

The July 9 presidential election now looks almost certain to come down to a battle between two camps: Mr Joko and Mr Kalla against former special forces general Prabowo Subianto and former minister Hatta Rajasa - although the second pairing is not confirmed and a third ticket is still an outside possibility.

Latest surveys show Mr Joko and political warhorse Mr Kalla topping the polls, even though Mr Joko has built his image on being an anti-establishment newcomer. Announcing the decision, Mr Joko said: ''We believe, God willing, we will be able to bring a movement for change in our beloved country.''

However, Mr Kalla is such a strong-willed and independent figure that some fear he might undermine Mr Joko, as he was accused of doing to Dr Yudhoyono. ''SBY had trouble with him being impatient, outspoken and showing him up,'' says ANU Indonesia expert Greg Fealy.

''[Mr Joko] is younger and untested at the national level and the fear is that Jusuf Kalla would be overbearing, condescending and might speak out of turn.''
