Lawrence Straus, Leslie Spier Distinguished Professor of Anthropology at the University of New Mexico (left), and Manuel Gonzalez-Morales (center), director of the Cantabria International Institute for Prehistoric Research, each presented a paper at the recent symposium honoring ASU Regents’ Professor Emeritus Geoffrey Clark (right).

Organized by three of the Regents’ Professor emeritus’ former students, the symposium included presentations by 12 scholars and four discussants. Colleagues and students traveled from England, Spain, Jordan and Korea, as well as from across the United States.

Neely believes it was important to recognize Clark’s accomplishments and influence on graduate students and colleagues. He also feels the event was one way to say thanks to Clark for the positive impact he has made in many professional lives.

Clark, who arrived at ASU in 1971, was pivotal to building the Department of Anthropology’s archaeology-track doctoral program. He remained a major figure in the program as the department grew and transitioned into the transdisciplinary School of Human Evolution and Social Change in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences .

A prolific author, speaker and field researcher, Clark is well known for his work regarding quantification in archaeological research, modern human origins and hunter-gatherers, particularly in the regions of Spain and Jordan.
