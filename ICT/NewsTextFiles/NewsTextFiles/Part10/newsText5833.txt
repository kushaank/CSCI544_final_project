
Janata Dal (United) president Sharad Yadav said on Monday the resignation of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar is final and is in everyone's favour.

Sharad Yadav's comments come ahead of the the JD(U) legislature party meeting to discuss the ongoing situation after Nitish said on Sunday he needed time till Monday to decide on the plea of JD(U) MLAs that he should withdraw his resignation and continue in office.

"The decision (Nitish Kumar's resignation) is in favour of the nation, the party and Nitish ji. It was a difficult decision, but is final and right," he said.

Two party MLAs have also said that Nitish should resign.

The JD(U) legislature party will meet on Monday to discuss the ongoing political scenario after the Bihar CM had said that he would re-think his decision.

"Nitish's resignation is the next step in continuation with the decision to part ways with the NDA," Sharad Yadav told reporters.

There were demonstrations by JD(U) activists in many parts of Bihar, demanding Nitish's return as CM.

Sharad had to face protests from Nitish supporters when he reached Patna Sunday afternoon.
