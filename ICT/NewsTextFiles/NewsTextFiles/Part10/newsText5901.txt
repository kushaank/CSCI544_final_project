
WASHINGTON (WKZO) -- A Michigan congressman is hoping to bring more attention to the plight of an American man who's stuck in an Iranian prison.Â Congressman Dan Kildee says that Amir Hekmati's one thousandth day in an Iranian prison was to be marked on Monday with a vigil in front of the White House. Hekmati has been in Iranian custody since 2011, when he made a trip to Iran to visit his grandmother. The Iranians accused him of being a spy, but Congressman Kildee says that's not true.

"This is a man who is innocent, who was simply travelling to visit family, served this country admirably in the Marine Corps," Kildee told WKZO. "He's now caught up as a political prisoner in a geopolitical struggle between Iran, the United States and other nations as Iran attempts to rejoin the international community."

Kildee says that supporters of Hekmati want the White House to do more to secure his release. The vigil on Monday was to take place from midnight to around seven PM, about a thousand minutes.
