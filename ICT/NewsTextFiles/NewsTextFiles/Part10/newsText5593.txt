
Investigators said two men are dead after a shooting at an apartment early Monday morning.

The East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office reported the shooting happened at an apartment on Gardere Lane at Ned Avenue in Baton Rouge.

The victims were identified as Orok Ironbar, 32, and Russell Celestin, 31, both of Baton Rouge.

Casey Rayborn Hicks, the spokeswoman for EBRSO, said the two men were found shot in Ironbar's apartment. She said Ironbar was already dead when authorities arrived on the scene.

She added Celestin was rushed to the hospital, but later died from his injuries.

Witnesses reported sheriff's deputies started arriving in the area just after midnight.

"We received a call around 10 p.m. about shots fired in the area. The shot spotter went off, but it was for a different address," said Hicks. "Deputies questioned residents in the apartment complex and were told that they did not hear gunshots. The victims' roommate arrived home around midnight and found them shot. Deputies questioned the residents of the apartment complex and again, they said they didn't hear anything."

The investigation is ongoing.

Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 225-344-7867.
