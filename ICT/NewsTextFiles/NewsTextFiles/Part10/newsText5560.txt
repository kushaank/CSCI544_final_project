, communication specialist for OLBH, said they are looking forward to the Women's Health Expo event.

"It's National Women's Health Week, and in recognition of that fact, we are hosting what will be our second annual Women's Expo. There is a myriad of options and opportunities and screenings, and all kinds of good things," Compton said. "It has expanded a lot since last year."

He said the Expo is a means for local women to allocate some time to tend to themselves.

"Obviously, in most families, women can be the decision-makers, they take care of the kids. Oftentimes, they are the ones to make sure that their spouses go to their appointments, so we just want to hold an event where women in our area can take some time to take care of themselves," he said.

The OLBH Women's Health Expo will feature free blood pressure checks, glucose testing, cholesterol screenings, skin cancer and other screenings. Free massages also will be offered.

In addition, the Women's Center's mammography, pap smear and bone density services will be available with same day results provided, insurance cards are required. Some women may qualify for discounted pap smears or free mammogram.

According to Compton, women will also have the opportunity to sign up for MyChart, OLBH's electronic health records system.

Additionally, health information from numerous OLBH departments, physician practices, risk assessments and physician referral services will be available.
