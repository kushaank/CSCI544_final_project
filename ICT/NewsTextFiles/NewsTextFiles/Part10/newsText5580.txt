
ALLAHABAD: Death of two children at  SN Children Hospital in the last fortnight has alarmed the district and health officials. On Sunday, a joint team of district administration and health officials, inspected hospital's functioning and detected several shortcomings.

Hospital authorities on their part have denied any medical negligence and claimed that while one child died due to septicemia meningitis, another due to head injury.

During the inspection, the team found that 52 children were undergoing treatment on 30 beds of the emergency ward, with two to three children recuperating on the same bed.

Realizing the gravity of the situation,  additional director (medical and health) Dr  Abha Srivastava ordered that 15 more beds be added to the ICU with immediate affect to ensure proper care of the children. She told Times of India: "Shortage of medicines and medical & paramedical staff has affected hospital's functioning." She further said that earlier the hospital had an ICU of 15 beds. It was increased to 30 beds following Allahabad High Court's order.

Besides, three additional staff nurses from  National Rural Health Mission were deployed at the hospital. Five staff nurses too were sanctioned. The additional director said that a blood collection centre would be set up on the hospital premises so that parents did not have to carry sick children to medical college for necessary tests.

During inspection, the team also detected paucity of medicines. Hospital authorities, however, denied dearth of essential or life saving drugs but added that more fund was required to ensure better care to every child.

Hospital records claimed that around 10,000 OPDs were attended by the doctors at the hospital and 7,000 patients were admitted for treatment in the past year. AD ( Healh) however, admitted that there was heavy rush of patients at the hospital daily and most of the kids arriving in the hospital were in serious condition.
