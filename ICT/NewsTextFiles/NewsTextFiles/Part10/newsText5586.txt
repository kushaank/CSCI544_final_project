
Grieving husband had to watch his wife on life-support die TWICE after 'hospital bungle'

DOCTORS failed to tell a grieving husband his wife was still alive for THREE days after he switched off her life support machine, a coroner has heard.

It is a fairly extraordinary turn of events.

But when he phoned the hospital three days later to make arrangements for her body to be released for burial he was shockingly told Marilyn was still alive and breathing on her own.

Giving evidence at Smethwick Coroners Court, he said he would never have left his wife's side for her remaining days if he knew she was still alive.

He added: "I was told it was only the machine keeping her breathing and there was no point prolonging the inevitable.

"They told us there was nothing more they could do and she would only live for a couple of minutes once I turned the machine off so I said my goodbyes.

The grandmother had suffered bleeding on the brain after falling down the stairs of her West Bromwich home.

She was rushed to Sandwell Hospital at 12.30pm on May 3 after her husband found her lifeless body at the bottom of the stairs.

Doctors told her desperate family that nothing could be done to save her life.

That left Malcolm with the heartrending decision to turn off the life support keeping her going at 6pm the same day.

Adjourning the inquest for three months, assistant Black Country Coroner, Angus Smillie told the widower: "It is an unexpected turn of events, you went home thinking she had passed away only to find out days later that she was in fact still alive.

"It is a fairly extraordinary turn of events."

Leader of Sandwell Council Darren Cooper has now called for a full investigation into how the blunder was allowed to occur.

He said: "My thoughts go to the family. It's a shocking set of circumstances.
