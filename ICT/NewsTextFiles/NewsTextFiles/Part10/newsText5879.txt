The three accused are due before court again for a pre-trial hearing on April 17th, 2015.

A date has been set next June for the trial of three former Anglo Irish Bank officials who have denied conspiring to commit tax and company law offences.

Aoife Maguire (60), Rothe Abbey, South Circular Road, Kilmainham, Dublin, Bernard Daly (65), Collins Avenue West, Whitehall, Dublin, and Tiarnan O’Mahoney (54) Glen Pines, Enniskerry, Co Wicklow, are facing charges relating to offences allegedly committed in 2003 and 2004.

Judge Mary Ellen Ring ordered that the trial go ahead on June 3rd, 2015, at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court.

The three accused are due before court again for a pre-trial hearing on April 17th, 2015.

Paul O’Higgins SC, prosecuting, said the case is liable to run  for at least four weeks.

He said there is a “great deal” of disclosure relating to the case, adding that it is connected to a number of cases in a sequence arising out of Anglo Irish Bank, which are not connected to these three accused.

On a previous date, Dublin District Court heard the case has no factual connection with the recent trial of three former officers of the bank.

Ms Maguire is accused of attempting to defraud Anglo and Revenue as well as conspiring to commit an offence under the Taxes Consolidation  Act  and conspiring with others to delete accounts at Anglo Irish Bank in 2004.

The two men are charged that, in 2003, they concealed a named account; conspired to obstruct and interfere with an officer of the Revenue Commissioners; conspired to conceal an account that Anglo Irish Bank had been required to produce for inspection, and that they produced incorrect documentation.
