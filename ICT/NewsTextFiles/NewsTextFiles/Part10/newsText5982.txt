Prime Minister Menachim Begin's Irgun, which blew up he King David Hotel in Jerusalem with over 90 deaths was certainly a terrorist organization, but that didn't stop Anwar Sadat from negotiating a peace agreement with him. A more notorious terrorist was Israeli Prime Minister Yitzak Shamir, who headed Lehi, a group that specialized in assassination British officials and police, even during World War II when Britain was at war with the Nazis. His organization also assassinated Count Folke Bernadotte, the UN negotiator between Israel and its Arab enemies.  Israel is a vigorous democracy, the only one in the Near East, but it is time for it to acknowledge the skeletons in its own closet and not look for excuses to extend the status quo, which is not sustainable in the long run.

At this time of formulating a unity Palestinian government, the security institutions must be under the Palestinian Authority and forget about a Hezbollah model of continuing the capability of launching missiles into Israel.  Any future date of ridding a terrorist group of its missiles capability is not reassuring for Israel.  Furthermore, any U.N. recognition of a Palestinian state will not come into being with having a terrorist organization in its coalition government.  It's just wasting time and undermining President Abbas's achievements so far with all agreements between Israel and the PA.

As a faithful Haaretz reader, I fully endorse this plan. Indeed, the PA cannot be trusted to pursue the struggle faithfully to the end, and only Hamas has the right kind of ideological commitment.

You cannot have the status quo and capitulation from the other side. The whole world blames you and you still can't do the right thing. Israel politicians have made their bed and will sleep in it.

It was Hezbollah that drove the IDF out of Lebanon. If Hezbollah is engaged in terrorism why not bring the evidence to the International Criminal Court of Justice? The U.S. has a solid reputation as a liar and a proponent of war crimes. The list is very long. So why should anyone believe either Israel or the U.S?. Neither are credible..

In an Independent state there is just 1 armed force and it answers directly to the government it is not an independent melitia. Hezbollah were created during a war and they don't want to disband but the national government doesn't have the capability to forcibly disarm them so is trying to find a compromise. Hamas wants from the start to have a right to this independent military capability. What are they going to do if by some miracle the talks do restart and Israel insists any palestinians state must be fully demilitarised? Fact is if Hamas want to be part the government but want their own official force then The entire PA will be held responsible. It won't be  Israel v Hamas it will be Israel v PA because Fatah make themselves equally as accountable as Hamas and must face the consequences equally.

If so, who is going to defend the Palestinians, in case of any Israeli aggression? If Israel has the right to have weapons, why not the Palestinians too? Unless you consider the Palestinians lower race.

this is just one more illustration of the fact that Islamists do not understand the basic concepts of democracy and statehood.

Likud are basically Israel's version of Hamas. Rejectionist fanatics who believe in the acquisition of territory by violence.
