
Former Illinois Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. will  refinance a house  mortgage to pay the remaining $550,000 of his forfeiture to the federal government.

Jackson is expected to make the $550,000 payment to the government by June 1 through a wire transfer, according to a recent court filing.

Jackson was sentenced to 30 months in prison for misusing some $750,000 in campaign funds. The former congressman was required to pay a $750,000 forfeiture to the federal government. Last year, Jackson made a $200,000 payment toward that balance via a check, records show.

Jackson is  currently serving his prison term  in a prison facility in Montgomery, Alabama.

Jackson's wife, Sandi, who  admitted to conspiring  with her husband on the spending of campaign funds and also failed to report some $600,000 of income on tax returns, will head to prison for one year once her husband completes his sentence.
