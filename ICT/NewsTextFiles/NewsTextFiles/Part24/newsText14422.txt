
STOCKTON (CBS13) — The wife of a man shot to death as he ate dinner at a popular Stockton plaza is pleading for answers.

On April 25 at around 10 p.m ., investigators say Francisco Sanchez, who had gone to the Janet Leigh Downtown Plaza for dinner, got into a confrontation and fight under the cineplex dome that ended with him being shot to death.

“He was shot multiple times by, you know, I believe to say a wicked person,” said his wife Ashley Sanchez.

Stockton Police say the victim had no gang affiliations, but the suspects are thought to be documented gang bangers.

“Me and my husband were married for 10 years and we have a beautiful 5-year-old son together,” Ashley said.

On Monday, she called her slain husband a good man and a Jehovah’s Witness. She says she’s speaking out for one reason.

“I came here to ask the public to please come forward with any information that you have on my husband’s murder,” she said.

Detectives released video on Monday of a woman and five men entering the Misaki Japanese Restaurant at the plaza, which is where they believe the argument may have started.

“These people that we’re going to show on video, we need to get identified,” said Sgt. Rich Ridenour.

He says they have preliminary identified some of the persons of interest in the video as Fourth Street Norteno gang members. Detectives won’t say what started the argument, but say that the victim was not involved with a gang.

Meanwhile, a widow and mother waits for the public’s help.

“I pray that something will be done to get these people off the street, that way no one else is hurt,” she said.

While there was an arrest police announced following the shooting, that person was released pending further investigation.

A $10,00 reward is being offered for tips leading to arrests.
