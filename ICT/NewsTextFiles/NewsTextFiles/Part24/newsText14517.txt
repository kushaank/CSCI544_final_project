Wedding Day Bomb Threat Hoax Groom Neil McArdle Jailed for 12 Months Wedding Day Bomb Threat Hoax Groom Neil McArdle Jailed for 12 Months Wedding Day Bomb Threat Hoax Groom Neil McArdle Jailed for 12 Months Wedding Day Bomb Threat Hoax Groom Neil McArdle Jailed for 12 Months Wedding blast: Groom who halted own wedding with bomb hoax jailed  A panicked English groom who staged a bomb hoax on his wedding day so his bride would not find out he bungled the booking has been jailed in Liverpool for 12 months. Neil McArdle had forgotten to fill in the forms to marry the "love of his life" Amy Williams, but could not face telling her that the big day "that was all she talked about" was not going to happen. Instead of saying "we need to talk" the 36-year-old tried to "weasel" out of his predicament, Liverpool Crown Court heard. As his bride got ready for her wedding he slipped out of their house in Kirkby, Merseyside, went to a phone box, disguised his voice and rang Liverpool Register Office, claiming: "This is not a hoax call. Theres a bomb in St Georges Hall and it will go off in 45 minutes." The call, 11 days after the Boston Marathon bombing, provoked "terror" at the office inside the neo-classical edifice of St Georges Hall in the centre of Liverpool, which was immediately evacuated and emergency services called. The would-be bride was left standing outside in her wedding dress with her mother and the rest of the wedding party as the area swarmed with police racing to the scene. But McArdles would-be in-laws were already suspicious, the court heard, and a row broke out with Williamss sister telling a "flustered" McArdle: "You probably done the bomb scare yourself." Police quickly traced the call and the defendant was arrested the same day and admitted to his "embarrassment and shame" that he panicked over bungling the forms and staged the bomb scare. Williams has stood by the defendant, the court heard, and they are still together. A tearful McArdle, who pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to a single charge of communicating false information with intent on April 26, was jailed for 12 months by Judge Norman Wright.

A bridegroom has been jailed for 12 months after staging a bomb hoax on his wedding day to try to prevent his bride discovering he had failed to complete the paperwork required for them to marry.  Neil McArdle, 36, had forgotten to fill in the necessary forms but could not face telling his fiancee, Amy Williams, because the wedding was "all she talked about", Liverpool crown court heard.  Instead, as she got ready on their wedding morning, he slipped out of their house and went to a phone box. Disguising his voice, he rang Liverpool register office and said: "This is not a hoax call. There's a bomb in St George's Hall and it will go off in 45 minutes."  The call, 11 days after the Boston marathon bombing in the US, caused the building to be evacuated and the emergency services called. When McArdle, his bride and both families arrived at the building in the centre of Liverpool, the area swarmed with police.  Later, after the building was checked and staff tried to help with the "delayed" ceremony, it was discovered that no booking for the wedding had been made. McArdle's would-be in-laws were already suspicious, the court heard, and Williams's sister was overheard telling a flustered McArdle: "You probably done the bomb scare yourself."
