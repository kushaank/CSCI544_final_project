
Melendez, 30 of Trenton, N.J., began to cross the road to meet his friend when he was struck by the mirror of a passing Lexus. The force of the crash left Melendez sitting upright in the right-hand lane, according to investigators.

Seeing his friend in the roadway, Raymond, 36 of Levittown, Pa., darted into traffic to try and drag Melendez to safety.

A passing Hyundai Santa Fe then struck both Melendez and Raymond.

The drivers of both cars stayed on the scene of the accident and were not intoxicated, according to police.

State Police said they would investigate if alcohol use played any role in the victims' actions.

The full cause of the crash remained under investigation Sunday.
