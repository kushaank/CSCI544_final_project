
Greensboro's Quaker Village shopping center, which Charlotte-based Aston Properties has owned since Feb. 2013, is set to undergo a major renovation.

Some neighbors of the Quaker Village shopping center in Greensboro say they are opposed to plans for a Walmart Neighborhood Market to locate there, Fox 8 reports .

The Triad Business Journal first reported in February of plans for a renovation planned for this spring that will bring a 41,839-square-foot grocery store.

Some residents say they don't want Walmart in a shopping center with mostly small businesses. They've started an online petition and are sharing with the shopping center's owner, Aston Properties, their concerns about traffic and noise.

Quaker Villageâ€™s existing buildings facing West Friendly Avenue â€” including an existing Starbucks , Elizabethâ€™s Pizza and Menchieâ€™s Frozen Yogurt â€” will stay in place.

The sites of a former Fresh Market store, Mix Martini Bar Night Club and Bounce U will be demolished for the project.
