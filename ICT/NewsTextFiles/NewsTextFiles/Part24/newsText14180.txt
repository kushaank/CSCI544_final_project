
Brighton's police chief has instructed officers to enforce a city ordinance that prohibits language that causes 'a breach of the peace'

A Michigan teen was issued a $200 ticket last month for swearing near a playground in a town that has made it against the law to use foul language.

Colin Anderson, 19, of Brighton, was given the citation after saying ‘this is f*****g bulls**t’ after an officer issued a summons to one of his friends for cursing near a playground.

Brighton Police Chief Tom Wightman told the Livingston County Daily Press & Argus that the teenagers received the notices after he instructed police to crack down on disorderly conduct, whi he said includes swear words.

The group was hanging out near the Imagination Station Playground, but said that no children heard their salty language.

The cops disagreed, and handed him the ticket.

The dirty language was used in the  ‘immediate vicinity of a municipal playground occupied by very young  children,’ he told the paper.

Anderson claims he muttered it under his breath, but Wightman said ‘that would require an officer with some incredible hearing’ to have heard muttering.

Wightman issued a stern warning for the youth of his small city in the suburbs of Detroit.

Neither Anderson nor Wightman returned messages left seeking further comment.
