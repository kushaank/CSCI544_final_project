
Former chief minister H D Kumaraswamy’s son, Nikhil Gowda, was arrested on Monday along with JD(S) leaders and workers when they staged a protest at the toll plaza on National Highway-7 (KIA Road) against the recent hike in toll by Navayug Devanahalli Tollway Private Limited.

JD(S) workers led by Nikhil Gowda and party’s BBMP unit president H M Ramesh Gowda gathered near the toll plaza and raised slogans against the company. Nikhil demanded an immediate rollback of the hike stating that it was badly affecting the road users.

Due to the protest, hundreds of vehicles lined up on either side of the toll gate. The protest passed off peacefully as adequate police force was deployed near the plaza. The JD(S) leaders were arrested as a preventive measure, police said.

However, a truck driver while reversing the vehicle reportedly rammed a car in which two foreign nationals were travelling to the Kempegowda International Airport. But, no one was injured in the mishap.
