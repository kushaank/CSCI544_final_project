"We congratulate President (Juan Manuel) Santos and the Colombian government for this advance." The FARC (Revolutionary Armed forces of Colombia) has long been deeply involved in, and profited from, cocaine production and transshipment, Kerry said. Reducing cocaine trafficking, including through eradication and interdiction, helped establish the conditions for the peace process now under way, he added.

In making this announcement, Colombian government officials underlined the importance of maintaining both manual and aerial eradication capabilities, Kerry said.
