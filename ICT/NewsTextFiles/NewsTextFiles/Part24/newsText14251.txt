
The program has grown to 18 prisons across the state and involves partnerships with more than dozens of animal welfare agencies and professional animal trainers.  The shelters and animal welfare agencies provide their local prison facilities with dogs at risk of going unadopted due to their disposition or behavior.  The inmate trainers work with dogs for 6 to 8 weeks to teach them basic behavior and socialization.  The inmates learn their dog training techniques under the guidance of professional dog trainers who volunteer their services to teach the inmates.
