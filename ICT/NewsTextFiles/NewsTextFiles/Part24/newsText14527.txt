
WILMINGTON, NC (WWAY) -- A man is in the New Hanover County Jail charged with multiple crimes after police say he threw crack cocaine out of his car while trying to avoid police all with two kids in the car.

WPD spokeswoman Linda Rawley says a police sergeant was in the 1000 block of Castle Street around 8 p.m. Friday when he saw someone he thought was selling drugs in a car with a window tint violation. The officer tried to stop the car, which instead drove off. Police say someone in the car threw what turned out to be crack out of the window. Police recovered 12 grams of the drug and seized more than $8,000 in cash after the car stopped in the 1100 block of Queen Street.

Investigators say they arrested Iglesias Montez Dowe, who had his girlfriend, her daughter and an infant boy in the car. They also continued their search at Dowe's home, where they say they found digital scales.

New Hanover County Jail records show Dowe, 31, is in custody under $100,000 bond. He is charged with child abuse, resisting arrest and several drug counts.

The woman in the car with Dowe was not charged, Rawley said.

This is an example of why our youth are growing up to be arrogant, dangerous and uninterested in contributing to society. When they are in the presence of low-lifes like this guy, they absorb that kind of lifestyle and it becomes a disturbing circle of life.
