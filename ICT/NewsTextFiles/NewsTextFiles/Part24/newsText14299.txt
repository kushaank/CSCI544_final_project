Palm Harbor, Florida -- The search continues for a missing Palm Harbor man who was last seen on May 10.

Family members tell Pinellas Sheriff's deputies 66-year-old Edmund Giers may have been seen driving north into the Holiday area on Sunday, May 11. He is reportedly familiar with Pasco and Hernando counties and has a liking to wooded areas.

Giers left his home in a 1999 white Geo Prism 4-door sedan with Florida tag H951UJ and a front vanity plate that reads "God Bless America."

Deputies say Giers may be endangered as he does not have the medications that he needs to treat the various medical conditions he suffers from.

Mr. Giers is 5'11" and weighs about 176 pounds. He has green eyes and grey receding hair. There is a scar on Giers' left wrist. He speaks broken English but is fluent in the Polish language. At this time, his clothing description is unknown.

Deputies are asking the public for their assistance in locating him, and ask that anyone with information on his whereabouts, report it immediately to the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office at 727-582-6200 or their local law enforcement agency.
