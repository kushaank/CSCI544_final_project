
State and local police are encouraging people to buckle up.

About 350 law enforcement agencies in Pennsylvania and police in 10 other northeastern states and Ontario are cooperating in a Click It or Ticket campaign today through June 8. Police will operate mobile patrols and traffic enforcement zones, especially at night, to remind drivers to wear their seat belts.

"Vehicle crashes are one of the leading causes of death, with most fatalities being attributed to unbelted motorists," Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said. "Currently, the commonwealth's seat belt usage rate is 84 percent, and it is our goal to increase this rate by the end of 2014."

In Pennsylvania in 2013, 425 people died in unrestrained crashes. That's down from 503 such deaths in 2012.

Motorists stopped for a traffic violation can receive a second ticket and fine for not wearing seat belts. Drivers and passengers are required by law to wear seat belts. Young passengers must be in approved safety or booster seats.

Funding for the $1.7 million targeted enforcement effort in Pennsylvania is from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
