MUSKEGON COUNTY, MI – A woman police say managed to steal gasoline for several weeks from a number of gas stations across a five-county area has been arrested after authorities released surveillance video photos to the media.

The 28-year-old Laketon Township woman was arrested Friday, May 16, by Muskegon County Sheriff's Office deputies.

The woman is currently lodged in the Muskegon County Jail on two separate outstanding warrants and she's being held there on a $12,000 cash or surety bond.

A male co-defendant is also lodged in the Muskegon County Jail.

The investigation into the gas larcenies continued Monday, May 19, but Muskegon County Sheriff's Lt. Shane Brown said police arrested the woman on outstanding warrants and believe she is the suspect connected to the gas larcenies.

The woman has an identifiable tattoo on her wrist, police said. Her name won't be released until she is arraigned, Brown said.

Investigators from multiple police agencies in Muskegon, Oceana, Ottawa, Mason and Newaygo counties worked together in an effort to locate and identify the woman who was allegedly driving a blue four-door Chevy Impala when she was stealing gasoline.
