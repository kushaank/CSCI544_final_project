
Harris County Precinct 4 constables are searching for thieves who ripped through northwest Harris County on a crime spree Sunday.

Investigators said in a matter of hours the thieves managed to steal one man's gun bag that included a .40-caliber handgun and ammunition. They broke windows on two police cars and stole handcuffs, leg irons and bullet proof vests.

Police said the thieves were seen driving through one neighborhood randomly firing guns out of a four-door Mazda.

Precinct 4 constables and Harris County sheriff's deputies cornered the men in a cul-de-sac off North Sky Road.

With nowhere left to go, the thieves left their vehicle and fled on foot, leaving everything they had stolen -- money, ammunition, the bullet proof vests and more -- in the car.
