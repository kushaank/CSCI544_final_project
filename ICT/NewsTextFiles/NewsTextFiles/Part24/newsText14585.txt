
A judge in New York City on Monday morning sentenced Occupy Wall Street activist Cecily McMillan to three months in jail and five yearsâ€™ probation for assaulting a police officer during a 2012 protest.

Judge Ronald A. Zweibelâ€™s Monday morning decision was handed down   in a Manhattan courtroom 14 days after a jury there found   McMillan, 25, guilty of deliberately striking a   plainclothes New York Police Department officer in the face with   her elbow. She faced a maximum of seven years in prison as a result of the   second-degree assault conviction.

â€œA civilized society must not allow an assault to be   committed under the guise of civil disobedience,â€� Justice   Zweibel said during Monday's hearing, according to a New York   Times report published shortly after the sentencing was   announced.

McMillan claimed during her trial that she instinctively struck   Officer Grantley Bovel after the cop groped her breast from   behind as she was walking out of the park where demonstrators   gathered on the six-month anniersary of the start of the Occupy   movement. Bovel tackled her moments later, and eyewitnesses say   McMillan went into a seizure for several minutes before being   treated. She testified that she had â€œno memoryâ€� of the   moment that the altercation occurred, but prosecutors showed the   courtroom grainy video footage which purported to show the   activist crouching down, then elbowing the officer in the face.   The defense countered with images from shortly after the incident   in which McMillan had noticeable bruises on her chest.

Nevertheless, McMillanâ€™s supporters have petitioned the court for   leniency ever since the sentence was dished out two-and-a-half   weeks ago. According to the New York Times, McMillanâ€™s friends   supplied Judge Zweibel with the signatures of more than 500   people opposed to a lengthy conviction, and over 160,000 people   signed an online petition asking Governor Andrew Cuomo for a   pardon. Days after her conviction, nine of the 12 jurors   reportedly signed a letter asking Zweibel for leniency.

"The judge could have given two years, we're relieved he did   not. Your presence and signing petitions made the   difference,â€� McMillanâ€™s lawyer, Marty Stolar, told a crowd   of supporters in New York City on Monday shortly after the   sentencing, according to freelance journalist Thomas Hintze.

McMillanâ€™s counsel filed a notice of appeal with regards to the   May 5 conviction on Monday morning, Stolar told supporters.

Thatâ€™ s a fallacy the one time I associated with the Tea party; they were in favor of requiring permits in order to protest, were I made a amusing anecdote about the sons of liberty asking for a permit to dumb tea into the Boston harbor.

Good comment by Kit Holz. It is quite interesting that instead of the senate and representative of the US protecting whistle blowers for identifying crimes against US civilians it is the Russians protecting the whistle blower. I thank Russia and Putin in particular for helping to protect our freedoms. You know the US would put Snowden in solitary confinement and keep him from speaking his important message.
