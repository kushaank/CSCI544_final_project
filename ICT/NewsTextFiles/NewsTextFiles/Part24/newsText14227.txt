
PANCHKULA: Continuing its investigation into allegations that lawyer  Saman Dhanak was murdered and not killed in a road accident in Morni, the police have finally retrieved internet details of the phone of 30-year-old  Neha Sharma, the woman who was accompanying the 25-year-old when their car plunged into a gorge on April 19.

Relatives of Saman have alleged that Neha conspired to murder their son and used internet on her phone for 25 minutes despite her claims of no network at the accident spot. Neha had spent around 10 hours at the site before help arrived.

A  senior police official said nothing suspicious was found in the internet details. "Neha used internet at the mentioned time (10.05am) but there was nothing suspicious. We still have to go through the details. We are also waiting for forensic reports," said ACP  Jagtar Singh. The police have, however, yet to record Neha's statement. "She suffered injuries on her jaw and cannot speak. We are waiting for her recovery," Singh added.

The family of Saman has accused the police of shoddy probe. Saman's younger brother Naman Parshad alleged the police was trying to manipulate facts.

Police commissioner Ajay Singhal said the special investigation team was carrying out the probe diligently.
