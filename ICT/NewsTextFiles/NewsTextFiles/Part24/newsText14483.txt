
SPOKANE, Wash.—Firefighters discovered a hash oil extraction lab in a house near 38th and Mt. Vernon during a call Monday afternoon.

Spokane police said there was a possible illegal marijuana grow at the house. Fire officials said they found marijuana plants and equipment to grow inside the home when they were searching for victims.

“There was a large amount of green leafy substance, lab related materials, butane, and the tubes that are used to distill THC from the marijuana plant itself,” said Brian Schaeffer with the Spokane Fire Department.

Crews were called to the house to check on six unconscious people according to authorities at the scene. However, emergency crews only took the person who called 911 to the hospital. Authorities said there were no other victims.

Neighbors said the caller lived inside the home and was a father.

Fire crews said they find marijuana grows more often than most people think. They said they find them many times in vacant apartments where other tenants had no idea there was a grow next door.

KREM 2 News spoke with a resident of the home. The resident said the grow inside the home was not illegal.

Hash oil is a powerful extract from the plant. Some say it produces a much stronger high. You can find many videos online on how to use butane to extract hash oil from marijuana. It is a new and fast method of getting the oil but it is also explosive.

Stories have appeared across the country of explosions resulting from the attempt to extract hash oil.
