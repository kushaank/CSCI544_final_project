
The Criminal Court Monday issued an arrest warrant against red-shirt leader Jatuporn Prompan after he declined to turn up to testify in the case that he was accused of defaming former prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva.

The court issued the warrant, telling police to arrest Jatuporn so that he would testify in court at 9 am next Monday.

Abhisit filed a lawsuit with the court, alleging Jatuporn with defaming him during red-shirt rallies on October 11 and 17 2009. Jatuporn alleged that Abhisit, which was the prime minister at that time, ordered troops to kill people.

Jatuporn's lawyer, Winyat Chartmontree, Monday asked the court to allow Jatuporn to postpone his testimony but the plaintiff disagreed, telling the court that Jatuporn had postponed his appearance in the court twice already.
