
Police released surveillance video of a man suspected of dragging a woman between cars in Bedford-Stuyvesant and sexually attacking her.

Police are searching for a man they say dragged a woman between two cars on the streets of Bedford-Stuyvesant and sexually abused her.

The man followed the 22-year-old woman before grabbing her, threatening her with a gun and attacking her at around 1 a.m. on Saturday, police said. The man fled the scene, and the woman was taken to a hospital where she was treated and released, police said.

A woman in the neighborhood who heard about the assault said she goes to church choir rehearsals nearby and sometimes gets out late near the same street where the woman was attacked.

"When we come out we are in groups," said Navorra Hendrickson. "So that's why I don't feel as bad like if I was by myself."

Authorities are asking anyone with information to call Crime Stoppers at 800-577-TIPS.
