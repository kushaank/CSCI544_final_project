
From my Paris hotel room, I watched helplessly as the attempted assassination of someone I know and admire unfolded on Twitter. The journalist Raza Rumi only narrowly avoided being sprayed with bullets on March 28, and he live-tweeted that he had been â€œdreading this day.â€� Hard to believe someone would want to kill this gentle, erudite man, with his Sufistic approach to religion (â€˜Rumiâ€™ is an adopted surname) and his laudably tolerant attitude (he has written a travel book about Delhi). His young driver, responsible for many family members, was killed and his bodyguard badly wounded. Raza is now in self-exile overseas and extremely traumatised by events. Bina Shah summed up how I was feeling as I impotently read about the attack when she wrote, â€œMy heart sank and it still hasnâ€™t resurfaced.â€� Unlike Bina, I donâ€™t reside and make a living from my pen in Pakistan. But fears for my friends have been making me feel more pessimistic for the nationâ€™s future than ever before.

Reflecting on these atrocities, Mira Sethi wrote an impassioned, elegiac article, â€˜Age of Innocence,â€™ its title echoing Edith Whartonâ€™s and Moni Mohsinâ€™s novels published under similar imprimaturs. In the piece, which is accompanied by faded family photographs, Sethi contrasts her own relatively carefree childhood with the current Pakistan of the Osama bin Laden Library, securitisation, and the violent crushing of the mildest dissent.

This might seem a rather nostalgic, selective vision of her early years in the â€™90s, and one online commenter urges her to â€œremind yourself that that was the very worst period in Pakistanâ€™s history and one which helped lay the foundation for the problems being faced now.â€� Yet Sethi deploys her nostalgia knowingly; in the space of this short article she recalls her uncle Shahid Sethiâ€™s kidnapping in 1997, and her father the renowned journalist Najam Sethiâ€™s similar abduction two years later. With bitter irony, she writes, â€œthose were the good old days when the government picked you up and threw you in prison, but at least you got out alive.â€� This finds resonance in Mohammed Hanifâ€™s dark humour about the recent attacks on journalists when he laments the passing of the days when the worst treatment journalists could expect from the ISI was â€œlight torture.â€� Mira is well aware that todayâ€™s â€œcountry maddened by terrorâ€� has not exploded from a vacuum. She has watched the harassing of family members for their political views and writings since her infancy, and realises that the current situation is only an acceleration of what has come before.

Miraâ€™s own brother, Ali Sethi, deploys fiction to write about a journalist from the same decade of the â€™90s in his novel, The Wish Maker. But Ali also shows that the seeds of censorship and violence were sown in an earlier era, the â€™80s of Ziaâ€™s autocratic rule. (Another creative writer and journalist from an illustrious family, Fatima Bhutto, also highlights censorship as one of Ziaâ€™s primary legacies, in her book Songs of Blood and Sword.) Sethiâ€™s protagonist is a young man named Zaki, who has grown up in a Lahore household presided over by his liberal, widowed mother, Zakia. The latter edits a pioneering womenâ€™s magazine and is described as â€œan interventionist, a journalist who took risks and gave thrills.â€� This suggests important things about the reporterâ€™s role: he or she should be politically involved, fearlessly confront hazards, speak truth to power, and always inform and entertain the public.

In Uzma Aslam Khanâ€™s Trespassing, one of the novelâ€™s four narrators, Daanish, studies journalism in Amherst, Massachusetts. There he discovers that the American â€˜freedomsâ€™ of expression and the press he hopes to be taught about are deemed less important than the promotion of consumer confidence. During the 1991 Gulf War, Daanish writes a journal about his suspicion that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was actively encouraged by the US, to justify an attack on its oil-rich former ally. Yet his coldly informal tutor dismisses his research as Daanishâ€™s â€œtaking pride in his own,â€� in one phrase erasing the myriad differences between Arabs and Pakistanis, and reducing the journal to mere opinion (while hysterical American headlines about Saddam Hussein are curiously interpreted as being factual).

Mumtaz, the femme fatale character from Mohsin Hamidâ€™s debut novel Moth Smoke, is an investigative journalist who writes under the pseudonym Zulfikar Manto. This name, with its resonances of one of the earliest globally-recognised Pakistani Anglophone writers (Zulfikar Ghose) and an internationally-acclaimed Urdu short story writer and essayist (Saadat Hasan Manto), as well as its hint of politics (Zulfikar Ali Bhutto), indicates journalismâ€™s confluence of the creative with the political. The unnamed American in Hamidâ€™s next novel The Reluctant Fundamentalist may also be a journalist, depending on how you read this notoriously ambivalent text. There are possible links between the American interlocutor and Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl who was brutally murdered by Al Qaeda in Karachi in 2002.

In Kamila Shamsieâ€™s Broken Verses, the main character Aasmani takes up a banal job in television soon after the â€œcable TV explosionâ€� of Musharrafâ€™s early 2000s government. The new mediaâ€™s strikingly female workforce idealistically seeks to bring â€œyouth culture, progressive thought, multiple perspectives, in-depth reportingâ€� to a Pakistani public previously accustomed to monochrome government propaganda. Although Aasmani isnâ€™t a journalist per se, the novelâ€™s detective elements, in which she tries to find out what happened to her mother and her poet lover, may be read metaphorically as relating to the investigative work of the reporter.

In conclusion, journalists are in danger more than ever in todayâ€™s Pakistan. The peril they stare down as well as broader debates about freedom of speech and censorship have long been represented in fiction. This should not surprise us because many writers work as journalists themselves, and the two enterprises of journalism and fiction share many features in common. I believe that the press must not be muzzled. Pakistan needs to foster a culture of talking, listening and arguing, as evinced in the countryâ€™s young but growing tradition of literature festivals. Nothing will be settled by abuse, threats, shooting and bombs. Everything will be unsettled.
