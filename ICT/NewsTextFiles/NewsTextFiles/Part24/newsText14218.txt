
PN deputy leader Mario de Marco today expressed his concern at the slowdown in economic activity in the manufacturing and retail sectors.

Speaking in Valletta, Dr de Marco said that now the government’s hands have been tied by the EU when it comes to the granting of industrial incentives, the government is going to have to “think outside of the box” in order to attract new investment.

He implored the government to take the country’s economy for granted. The government must focus on all economic sectors he said, and not just the successful ones.

Dr de Marco also expressed his worry at the reduction in exports, saying that Malta has suffered the largest drop in exports in all of the EU.

Ever since someone came out with the statement "Think outside the box", it's become a cliché for anyone pretending to be an original thinker! Millennia ago Solomon said there's nothing new under the sun!

You can only "skin a cat" (here I go thinking inside the box) so many ways!  In order to be a winner, you have to work harder, smarter and give a better bang for the buck.  It's not thinking outside the box.  It's thinking inside the box where we all reside!

Dr. De Marco was it not that incompetent minister Gatt who once said that manufacturing was dead? Anyhow you are right however you must take charge of the PN as SB is an incompetent moaning, annoying, usurper.

Come on, Mario, who wants to take care of business?  Playing politics is much more fun.
