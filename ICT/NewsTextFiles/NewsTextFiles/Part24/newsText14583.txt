Maryland Live Casino security told police that around 2 a.m. Saturday they saw men tampering with cars in the valet parking lot of the casino.

Police said officers began to search for the men when they found a 46-year-old Pasadena man who told them he was sleeping in his car in the parking lot when he was accosted by three black men.

He told police he was struck by one man while another robbed him of his wallet with cash inside. All three attackers fled toward the movie theaters.

Officers expanded their search area and found one suspect, later identified as 24-year-old Steven Biko White, walking through the parking lot near the movie theater, police said.

Casino security helped officers confirm through video surveillance that White was involved in the robbery. Police said he was arrested and charged with robbery, second-degree assault and theft. He was also served an outstanding arrest warrant for possession of marijuana from Prince George’s County, police said.

Patrol officers continued to search the area for the other suspects and were able to positively identify a second suspect as 22-year-old Orlando James Lawson Jr., police said.

However, officers were unable to find Lawson or the other man, police said.

Police said an application for the charges of robbery, assault and theft were submitted to the District Court Commissioner for Lawson, and there is currently a warrant for his arrest.

The third man involved remains unknown, but police said he was a black man with a medium complexion and dreadlocks.

Police are offering up to $2,000 in reward money to those who can offer information leading to an arrest.  Anyone who can help should call Metro Crime Stoppers at 866-7-LOCKUP.
