
IT’S one of the worst things that could happen to you at work. To learn that a friend or family member has died.

But that’s exactly what happened to a news anchor in Taiwan while she reported live on air.

Next TV News ’ Lee Chinyu fought back tears as details of her fellow broadcaster’s death on Thursday appeared on the autocue.

Chinyu appeared shocked as she struggled to announce the suspected suicide of her friend Erich Shih.

“Breaking news just in. It is reported that the CtiTV news anchor Eric Shih has been found today in his house — committed suicide. There was no note,” she said.

Shih, 46, returned to Taiwan in 2009 having worked for many years as a foreign correspondent in the United States.

Police said their investigation into Mr Shih’s death is ongoing.
