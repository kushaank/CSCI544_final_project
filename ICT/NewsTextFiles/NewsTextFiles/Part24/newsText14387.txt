NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (WAVY) – A man is accused of kicking, pistol whipping and shooting at several victims during a home invasion earlier in the month, killing a woman.

On May 10, two women were hit but gunfire in a home in the 2200 block of Jefferson Avenue between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m.

According to court documents obtained by WAVY.com, three suspects forced their way into the home armed with handguns. They forced four adults to the floor at gunpoint and demanded personal property and other items.

“All of the intruders made threatening statements and demands while kicking the victims in the face and body to enforce those demands,” the criminal complaint said.

The suspects talked about killing the victims and setting the house on fire, and before leaving, opened fire toward the victims. One was struck in the shoulder, while the other was hit several times, killing her.

Police will not release the name of the victim. She is only listed as “K.M.” in court documents.

Further investigation of the homicide resulted in witnesses positively identifying one of the suspects. Jason Robles, 31, was arrested Friday and charged with a slew of crimes, including murder, robbery and abduction.

“Two of these individuals have positively identified one of the suspects who held the residents at gunpoint, kicked and pistol whipped the victims and who actively participated in shooting the victim who ultimately died,” the documents said.

Robles is a convicted felon. Stay with WAVY.com for more on this developing story.
