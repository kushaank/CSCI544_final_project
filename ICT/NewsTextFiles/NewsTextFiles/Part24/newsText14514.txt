
(WJLA) - The video made headlines – a raucous party in a rented beach house, new high school graduates, and red cups filled with beer and alcohol, according to those present.

And in the middle of it all, Maryland Attorney General Doug Gansler faces an issue which will confront many parents in the next few weeks – how to control senior week celebrations in Ocean City and Delaware Beaches.

Ocean City Police Chief Ross Buzzuro says he will not tolerate the drunken behavior captured in these YouTube posts from years past.

"Behave, have a great time," he says. "It's the time of their lives, but they have to be responsible and they have to respect others and the environment that they live in."

He also says that his officers will be out in full force, ready to issue alcohol citations and make arrests.

And the potential pitfalls for young people don't end on the boardwalk or with the police. Those who rent out these houses say they're on the lookout for problems as well.

"We have friends that rent and have had terrible problems," says Jerry Jobeson.

"I know a lot of people that rent to a parent or rent to somebody and they're a little suspicious this time of year...they're gonna stop in and if they see kids they're gonna throw them out and not give their money back."

Ocean City Mayor Rick Meehan says he wants the Senior Beach Week tradition to live on. After all, it means revenue for the town. But he adds that parents need to play a bigger role as well.

"There has to be some responsibility at home to make sure that those individuals that come here are prepared to do so."

For Meehan, the police, and the landlords, this means no alcohol in those big red cups.
