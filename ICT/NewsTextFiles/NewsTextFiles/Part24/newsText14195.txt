Charges against a St. Louis man accused of killing a Phelps County man in January 2013 have been dismissed, according to the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney’s office.

Larry Wandrick, of the 4700 block of Plover Avenue in St. Louis, had been charged with one count of first-degree murder and one count of armed criminal action in the fatal shooting of 38-year-old Michael G. Cunningham in Kinloch.

Cunningham, who had lived in Rolla and grew up in Edgar Springs, was an employee at Tomco Metals for more than a decade. Cunningham had two children, Corey Cunningham, and Christian "Bernice" Cunningham.

Magee said because there is no statute of limitations on murder cases, if new evidence or witnesses becomes available, the case could be brought back up in the future.

The charges were dismissed before Wandrick’s murder trial was to take place the week of May 12.

Cunningham was found deceased from a gunshot wound in Kinloch Jan. 15, 2013.

St. Louis County Police told the Rolla Daily News in January 2013 that Cunningham knew Wandrick and they were together on abandoned property. "Something went wrong, there was a conflict and shots were fired," Police Officer Randy Vaughn said.

Wandrick was found in Dellwood where he had barricaded himself inside a residence. After an approximate four-hour standoff, Wandrick was found inside the trunk of a vehicle.

During the standoff, officers were able to safely remove a 2-year-old boy from inside the home.
