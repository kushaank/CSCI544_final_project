Mugshot of 65-year-old Linda Douglas. Indicted for stealing money from the Jellico police department drug fund.

(WBIR) A former Jellico City worker accused of stealing from a police department drug fund has been charged.

The Tennessean Bureau of Investigation announced Monday it obtained indictments for Linda Darrell Douglas after an investigation which began in late 2012.

TBI said it began investigating Douglas in December 2012 after a state audit.

During the investigation, TBI said it found that Douglas, while working as Jellico City Recorder, took approximately $73,000 from the police department drug fund and other city funds. She was then fired.

The Campbell County Grand Jury indicted Douglas on one count of theft over $60,000 and three counts of Official Misconduct.

TBI said Douglas turned herself in on Monday. She was released after posting $10,000 bond.
