
 A prosecutor in the port city of Piraeus on Monday approved a request by police to publish the photographs of three suspects in the September 13, 2012 murder of a couple in their Piraeus house.

The suspects, two men aged 33 and 35 and a woman aged 25 – all Albanian nationals – are alleged to have posed as prospective tenants to gain access to the home of a 60-year-old woman and her 68-year-old husband.

The home was found ransacked while the couple had both been stabbed to death.

The police are appealing to the public for information on the three suspects.
