
An inquiry has found no police fault over a body discovered in marshland days after a search was sparked by "cries for help".

The body was found near Kilmarnock in February four days after officers were called to reports of a man shouting.

A search found nothing but a search for a missing hospital patient several days later located his body.

The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner examined the case and was satisfied with the police response.

The man, whose body was found on Saturday 22 February, had been reported as a missing person on Friday 21 February.

Four days earlier, after the farmer reported shouting from a field, police launched a search involving dogs and helicopters, but found no-one.

On 21 February Police Scotland began a missing person inquiry into a man last seen leaving Crosshouse Hospital several days before.

Officers found the man's body in marshland the next day. There were no suspicious circumstances.

Police Scotland referred the matter to the PIRC for an independent investigation.

Investigators took statements from officers and witnesses, examined police audio recordings, command and control incidents, statements and other documents.

Police Investigations Commissioner Prof John McNeill said: "From all the available evidence there is nothing to suggest that the death of the man was attributable to any act or omission by officers of Police Scotland.

"I am satisfied that the initial police response to the phone call on 17 February and the missing person inquiry were appropriate."
