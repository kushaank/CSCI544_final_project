Fremont County Sheriff's Office deputies wore black bands over their badges Thursday to mark National Peace Officer Memorial Day.

The bands are meant to symbolize mourning for all fallen officers killed in the line of duty in Fremont County.

In a press release Thursday, the Fremont County Sheriff's Office specifically remembered Lt. Steve Crerar, who was killed April 30, 1995, while transporting a juvenile prisoner to the Wyoming Boys' School in Worland. According to officials, the prisoner was able to remove his own restraints and attack Crerar. He reportedly took Crerar's service revolver and shot the lieutenant.

"Fremont County lost a great man that day," Undersheriff Ryan Lee said. "Lt. Crerar was a dedicated peace officer; we will never forget Steve's diligence to his duty, and we pay tribute to him as well as his family on this day of remembrance."

Crerar was survived by his wife, two daughters and father.

Peace officers often are the first to respond to emergencies throughout Fremont County. Lee said they sometimes have to deal with violent people who have chosen to harm or seriously injure innocent people.

"Due to the circumstances of any incident, or by the deliberate act of a person, peace officers risk being killed while performing their public safety duties on a daily basis," Lee said.

He asked that all Fremont County citizens take notice of the officers serving currently and remember those who have lost their lives on duty throughout the state of Wyoming.
