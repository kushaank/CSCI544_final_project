“Detective Ray has been a member of the Red Bank P.D. for the past ten years.  He began in the Patrol and Traffic Divisions as an officer, then was promoted to supervisor.  He moved to the Criminal Investigations Division three and one-half years ago.  He has been instrumental in investigating and solving numerous violent felony cases as well as crimes against property.

  In the past year, he resolved an Aggravated Statutory Rape/Human Trafficking case against two adults involving two juvenile victims who were found to be escapees from a facility in Georgia.  In addition to that high-profile case, he was involved in the following felony cases: a D.U.I. stop resulting in the arrest of a suspect involved in three armed robberies of drug stores in Red Bank and Chattanooga; a Rape and Kidnapping case that resulted in two people charged with Aggravated Rape and Attempted Murder; as well as a shooting in which two people are charged with two counts each of Attempted Murder and Especially Aggravated Assault. All of these cases were interspersed among various other assigned cases.
