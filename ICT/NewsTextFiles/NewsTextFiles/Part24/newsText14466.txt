
A boy of seven, who was abducted about three days ago, was found dead at Puran Bogra of Bogra district town last evening.

The dead is Siam Hossain, son of CNG-run auto-rickshaw driver Belal Hossain of Puran Bogra Paschim Para. He was a student of class two of Wapda Government Primary School.

Family sources said a gang kidnapped Siam on Saturday noon when he was playing with his friends beside Bogra-Shantahar rail route.

The abductors initially demanded a ransom of Tk 3 lakh from the family over mobile phone. Agreeing to the condition set by the kidnappers for a ransom payment of Tk 80,000, the family kept the money at an abandoned building at Phulbari in the town. But the abductors did not keep their word, sources said.

The abductors also threatened to kill Siam if the family informed the police, sources added.

Gaziur Rahman, assistant superintendent of police in Bogra, said the victim's father filed an abduction case with Bogra Sadar Police Station on Saturday evening.

Police raided different areas in the district, but could not nab the kidnappers, said Gaziur.

Police are after them, the police official added.
