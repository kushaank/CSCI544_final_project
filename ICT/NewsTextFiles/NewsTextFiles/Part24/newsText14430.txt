
COEUR d’ALENE, IDAHO (AP) — Authorities say a body found in the woods near Coeur d’Alene may be linked to an eastern Washington state investigation. The Coeur d’Alene Press reports the body was recovered Friday near Fernan Lake Road after Spokane police investigators received a tip. Kootenai County sheriff’s Lt. Stu Miller says detectives from the two agencies searched the Coeur d’Alene National Forest for about two hours.

They found the body 10 miles east of Fernan Lake Village. Miller declined to identify the body. No details were released about the Spokane investigation. Spokane police say identification would follow an autopsy.
