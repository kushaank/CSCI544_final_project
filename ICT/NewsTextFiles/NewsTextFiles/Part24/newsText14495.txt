PORTLAND -- A researcher for the Oregon Democratic Party was the first person to request a police report that accused GOP senatorial candidate Monica Wehby of stalking her ex-boyfriend.

The report, first publicized on Friday by Politico, started a firestorm of controversy about the candidate just days before the May 20 primary election.

The police report filed by Wehby ex-boyfriend Andrew Miller was first requested by Democratic Party employee Jon Friedman on April 17, according to police records disclosed to KGW. The log records everyone who requested copies of a report. All other requests for the Wehby stalking report came from the media.

Friedman is a researcher for the Oregon Democratic Party, according to a party spokesman. The party declined any other comment when pressed why Friedman pulled the report.

On Friday, Senator Jeff. Merkley, a Democrat, said he was unaware of the police report when it surfaced in the news media.

I had never hear this information until I heard it on the news,  Merkley said while attending a Lines for Life event in Portland.

This is an issue of private family life,  Merkley said.  I can say that issues of family life are best left in the private family.

Two more police reports have since surfaced.

In 2007, Wehby's ex-husband called the police to complain that his estranged wife had thrown a notebook at him at a party. He told officers he was  tired of the ongoing harassment  from Wehby and claimed that she had pulled his hair, slapped him and thrown items at him over the past year.
