
MUMBAI:  Chaos reigned on the Western Express  Highway at  Dindoshi on Monday as only motorcyclists were permitted to use one of the three south-bound lanes on the flyover, which is currently under repair. The south-bound portion of the  flyover was completely shut for traffic between Friday night and Sunday night as the concretizing was still fresh.

The traffic police had initially planned to throw open at least one of the south-bound lanes on the bridge for all vehicles by 3pm on Monday. But they could not do so fearing that vibrations from vehicular movement could lead to formation of cracks on the flyover.

Morning peak hour traffic was hit badly with backlogs stretching up to Kandivali (E). But even around 8pm, the situation wasn't any better. "I was stuck on the Malad (E) flyover at 8.30pm and could spot snaking queues of vehicles ahead all the way till Dindoshi," said a motorist.

"We decided to permit bikers on one lane to decongest the  snarls below. The rest of the south-bound stretch was freshly concretized and we could not take the risk of allowing four-wheelers near it as vibrations could lead to crack formations," said DCP (traffic-western suburbs) Pratap Dighavkar. Adding, "We will once again allow all vehicles to use one-and-half lanes of the south-bound stretch on the bridge from Tuesday morning." The bridge repair is expected to conclude by the end of this month. Fifty traffic constables, four sub-inspectors, two inspectors and an ACP were deputed for Monday's bandobast at Dindoshi.
