
GURGAON: The district administration has constituted a redress committee for Residents' Welfare Association, which will work with all stakeholders towards resolving the various civic issues in Gurgaon's residential areas.

The  deputy commissioner  Shekhar Vidyarthi, who will be heading the committee, said that the new administrative body will address the complaints filed by residents against builders over different maintenance issues. "The developers are bound to follow government rules and work as per those rules. I have asked the RWA representatives to list their 10 most important grievances and submit these to my offices, which will later be taken by the new redress committee," said Vidyarthi.

The first meeting of the redress committee has been scheduled for May 29, which is likely to be attended by the senior town planner, R K Singh, who has been appointed the member  secretary of the committee. District officials said that this decision was taken on Monday, after the deputy commissioner's meeting with members of the local RWAs. "The RWA members had come to apprise him about the works not completed by the developers, which was in contravention of the terms and conditions of the licenses issued to them by the  state government," said a spokesperson of the administration.

The deputy commissioner has also asked a delegation of local developers at a recent meeting to 'furnish a status report on the availability of essential services in the areas developed by them.'

"At the coming meeting of the redress committee, all stakeholders will be given a chance to make their case, and a decision will be taken on the spot. We will make every effort to provide relief to the residents," an official said.

Poor condition of roads, scarce water supply, sewerage and drainage issues and poor maintenance of parks and green belts are among the most common complaints made routinely by Gurgaon's RWAs.
