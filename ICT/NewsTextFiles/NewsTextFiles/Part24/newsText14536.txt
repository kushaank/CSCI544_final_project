
ARMED ROBBERY: Police cordoned off the Still Working Bar/Manuka Wood Fire Pizza in Hamilton after it was robbed overnight.

Police are seeking witnesses to the armed robbery of a popular Hamilton bar last night.

A staff member was confronted by two offenders with a shotgun as he walked to his car. They forced him to return to the bar and open its safe.

Detective Senior Sergeant Ross Patterson, of the Hamilton CIB, said police were called to the Still Working Bar/Manuka Wood Fire Pizza premises shortly before 11pm after reports a staff member had been robbed.

"As a staff member was locking up and walking towards his car about 10.45pm he was confronted by two men, one who was armed with a double-barrelled shotgun," Patterson said.

"The victim had a sum of money taken off him before he was led back inside and forced to open the store's safe where the thieves took more money.

"The offenders then fled out the store's backdoor and drove off in a silver Subaru car that had been parked in an adjoining service lane."

The offenders both wore gloves and hooded sweatshirts with the hoods over their heads. Fabric covered their faces.

"At this time our investigators would like to hear from anyone who saw anyone acting suspiciously around the bar or service lane shortly before the robbery or who saw anyone linked to the silver Subaru on Egmont St around 11pm," Patterson said.

Police officers found a silver Subaru Impreza station wagon parked in nearby Egmont St. It was believed to be linked to the robbery.

The car had been stolen earlier in the evening from outside an address in River Rd, Fairfield. It would be examined today, Patterson said.

Anyone with any information on the identity of those involved or who witnessed anything suspicious was asked to contact Detective Sergeant Simon Cherry, at the Hamilton central police station, on 07 858 6200.
