The Milton Hershey School in Hershey, Pennsylvania.

HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) - An employee at a Pennsylvania school established by the Hershey chocolate company's founder has been fired after a hidden video camera was found in the boys' bathroom.

Police were called Friday after Milton Hershey School students found a small digital camera in a bathroom and showers at the transitional living facility, a dorm-like setting for high school seniors.

The school says a staff member was questioned and fired. His identity hasn't been disclosed.

Derry Township police say a search of his apartment found evidence related to the camera and three loaded handguns.

The Milton Hershey School is a free, private, co-ed boarding school for children from low-income families. It was established by Milton Hershey, founder of The Hershey Co., whose treats include Kit Kat and Reese's peanut butter cups.
