
ST.PAUL - For many in St. Paul, the Victoria Day holiday weekend was a time for remembering and reflection.

On Monday afternoon, hundreds of people attended the funeral service for Father Gilbert Dasna -- a 32-year-old associate priest from Cameroon who was fatally gunned down May 9 by St. Paul resident John Carlos Quadros. Minutes after the shooting, a a gun fight broke out between Quadros and RCMP members downtown. Three Mounties were injured during the melee and Quadros, 55, was killed.

Dasna is remembered by those who knew him best as a kind and loving man, with ties to not just those in St. Paul but in surrounding communities in northern Alberta, particularly the Catholic community in Saddle Lake.

Reverend Bishop Paul Terrio led Monday’s service and described Dasna as a “good shepherd”.

Terrio told the crowd that Dasna had recently inquired about becoming a full-time pastor in the community.

Those words became tragically all too true. While alone in the rectory behind the church where he lived in town, Dasna answered the door bell at around 6 p.m. last Friday and was greeted with multiple gun shots to the chest.

Terrio took a moment to thank and offer prayers to the injured RCMP members before leading a prayer in memory of both Dasna and Quadros, including the family and friends of the departed.

Two of the Mounties have been released from hospital. The female, who suffered serious foot and leg injuries when she was pinned inside her truck, remains in care.
