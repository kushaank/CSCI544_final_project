
AMBALA: A group of property dealers held a protest at the office of  Ambala City tehsildar alleging that the revenue department officials sought money from buyers and sellers for registering land deals, failing which no one was entertained. They even offered to produce evidence in support of their allegations before the deputy commissioner.

The agitators calmed down only after sub-divisional magistrate (SDM)  Vinay Partap Singh received their memorandum to be given to the Haryana chief minister and assured them of proper action in the matter. The dealing clerk in the appointment section of tehsildar's office was also changed after the demonstration, but the protesters termed it mere "eyewash."

"The SDM asked us to get the officials caught red-handed if our allegations were true. But we do not need to do that as we have sufficient evidence to point the malpractices going on in the tehsildar's office for getting appointments for land deal registrations. Rates of bribe are fixed for appointments. One has to pay between Rs 1,000 and 5,000, depending on the value of the land deal for early appointment," alleged Ashok Goyal, who led the protesters.

Prem Chand Gupta and Surjit Budhiraja alleged that the system of seeking prior appointment for registration of land deals was implemented in Ambala without any orders from the  financial commissioner (revenue). "The system of seeking appointments was being followed only in Gurgaon and Faridabad so why is it being enforced here in Ambala without official orders," both alleged.

Meanwhile, Ambala City tehsildar  Raj Kumar Bhouria said the allegations by protesters were baseless. "They are leveling allegations against officials without verifying facts. We are doing our work systematically and without any wrongdoing," he claimed.
