
COURTHOUSE � A Philadelphia man was sentenced to time served to 12 months in prison for violating his parole by pleading guilty to stealing a pair of sunglasses from the King of Prussia mall and attempting to flee from mall security.

Larry Richard Lee Parrott, 29, of the 2000 block of North Marston Street, was sentenced to time served to 12 months in prison and ordered pay $375 in restitution to the Sun Glass Hut. He pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor charge of harassment and a third-degree felony charge of retail theft was withdrawn as a part of the plea. By pleading guilty to harassment he violated parole stemming from a retail theft in Limerick in 2010. Parrott was sentenced to two years of probation for the parole violation.

Court documents show Parrott has been in prison since May 19, 2013.

According to the affidavit of probable cause, on March 13, 2013 at 8:45 p.m., a man � later identified as Parrott � walked into the Sunglass Hut with a woman in the King of Prussia Mall and began to look at several pairs of sunglasses. The affidavit of probable cause states Parrot and the woman, who is not identified in the arresting affidavit, left the store at 8:49 p.m.

One of the employees of the store noticed the sunglasses � valued at $375 � were missing, notified mall security and followed Parrott. Mall security stopped Parrott and found he was holding a purple bag. When stopped, Parrot fled the area dropping the purple bag and ran into the parking lot where he was arrested by Upper Merion police officers. The affidavit of probable cause does not say the woman who accompanied Parrot into the store was arrested or not. It also does not mention if the sunglasses were ever recovered.

Parrott has four prior retail convictions not including the most recent in Upper Merion.
