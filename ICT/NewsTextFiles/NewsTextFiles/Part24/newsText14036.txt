
Tampa, Florida, May 2, 2012—“Our kalia (canoe) has arrived and been welcomed,” said the Rev. Sione Veikoso, hailing the passage by the United Methodist General Conference of a comprehensive plan for Pacific Islander ministry in the United States.

“Our canoe has been wandering around and now has a port,” stated the chair of the denomination’s Pacific Islander National Caucus of United Methodists, a California pastor. The plan, four years in development, sets up a structure comparable to United Methodist ministry plans for other racial/ethnic communities.

Many immigrant Pacific Islanders arrive in the United States as Methodists but do not always find quick entry into the US church culture. The plan addresses this issue, and also how to incorporate the spiritual energy of Oceanic people into the church.

There are now some 70 United Methodist congregations composed primarily of Pacific Islanders in the United States. Members come primarily from Tongan, Samoan, and Fijian backgrounds, but there are also US-based populations from Guam, the Mariana Islands, Micronesia, Hawaii, and Palau—a total of roughly 1.1 million people.

The plan was developed over a four-year period by a committee staffed by the General Board of Global Ministries, which will also administer the work of the new entity.

The denomination’s general budget for the next four years includes $544,000 to fund the Comprehensive Plan for Pacific Island Ministries.
