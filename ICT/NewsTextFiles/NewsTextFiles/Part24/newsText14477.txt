
Police have filed a case four days after a launch capsized in the Meghna River at Munshiganjâ€™s Gazaria, killing scores of people.

Gazaria Police Station SI Haider Hossain Akhand filed the case early on Monday accusing the owner of the vessel MV Miraj-4 and six of its staff.

The launch sank after it was caught in a storm on its way to Shariatpur from Dhaka on Thursday.

So far, 56 bodies were recovered.

According to case details, the vessel was overloaded and the accident occurred due to negligence of the authorities.

Police filed the case as the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) did not make any move, said Gazaria Police OC Ferdous Hossain.
