Lommel United midfielder Johanna Omolo was on target as Harambee Stars secured a slim 1-0 victory over visiting Comoros in the first-leg tie of the 2015 AFCON preliminary round qualifiers at the Nyayo National Stadium, yesterday.

Stars faithful were on their feet and performed the mexican wave in the 34th minute when the Belgium-based midfielder unleashed a thunderous right-footed shot past the hapless Comoros custodian Mroivili Mahmoud into the top left corner of the net.

This was just a minute after Dennis Oliech combined well with Jamal Mohammed but unfortunately the AC Ajaccio striker’s effort went wide.

In the 22nd minute, Fouad Bachirou dribbled through the midfield, but was fouled by Lawrence Olum, who’s making his national team debut.

However, nothing came out of the resulting free kick.

Four minutes later, Victor Wanyama saw his long range shot go wide after a good run by Aboud Omar on the left before Mohamed SoulÃ© missed a precious opportunity from Ali M’Madi’s pass.

Moments later, Omolo delivered a fine pass but Oliech’s strike landed into Mahmoud’s safe hands.

Â Kenya could have gone to the break leading 2-0, but Omollo’s goal was ruled offside.

On resumption, Kenya continued piling pressure and created numerous chances, but the strikers wasted them.
