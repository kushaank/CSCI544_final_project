
GALESBURG � A Galesburg man arrested earlier this month for possession of more than 350 grams of meth will see his case proceed to arraignment after he waived his right to a preliminary hearing Monday afternoon.

William Dewey Avery III, North Cherry Street, was arrested just before 10:30 a.m. May 6 after police received a confidential tip that Avery was producing the drug at a Cherry Street apartment.

Avery is facing charges of aggravated unlawful production of methamphetamine and possession of methamphetamine manufacturing materials, as well as possession of the drug.

All three offenses are non-probational and Avery could see extended prison terms if convicted.

According to investigators, officers responded to the Cherry Street apartment and located Dewey sitting outside near a backpack containing a strong chemical odor consistent with the production of the drug.

Additionally, investigators also noted a similar odor coming from Avery�s person, which prompted police to search both Avery and the backpack.

The search of Avery uncovered a battery and several pieces of plastic tubing.

Investigators also discovered a plastic Gatorade bottle inside the backpack containing a white powder and blue liquid, which officers believed to be signs of the �one-pot� method of producing meth.

The most recent set of charges are not Avery�s first brush with meth-related offenses.

He has a misdemeanor conviction from 2009 for purchasing meth-related materials, as well as two burglary convictions from 2006 and 2008 respectively in which he served time in the Department of Corrections.

Avery remains in the Knox County jail on $150,000 bond. He will appear in court for his arraignment June 4.
