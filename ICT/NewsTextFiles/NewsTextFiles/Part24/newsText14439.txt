
The mascot of the Fall River library, a turtle named Franklin, was stolen last month and now the coalition has announced a reward for anyone who has information about the turtle's exact whereabouts or the person responsible for taking him.

A coalition member says Franklin is easily identifiable with a yellow dot under his chin and two red marks on his chest, and that he was an important learning tool for children.

The theft was caught on camera and police are searching for the person responsible. A librarian says the turtle was stolen Saturday night by a person who hid behind stacks of library books until after it closed.

Police haven't released the surveillance footage, but the librarian told ABC 6 News that someone from the library checked out the area before locking up and did not spot the person hiding. It was after the library was closed that Franklin was taken.

"I was very disappointed when I received this news. I know of so many stories of children who look forward to going into the library and one of the first things that they want to do is to greet the turtle,” said Fall River Mayor William Flanagan.

It is unclear why someone would want to steal the turtle. The theft is under investigation by the Fall River police department.
