
HYDERABAD: To mark the International AIDS Candle Light Memorial, several transgenders and HIV positive people took out a rally on the eve of the memorial in the city on Sunday. Walking from Osmania Medical College, the rally was organised by the Andhra Pradesh State AIDS Control Society (APSACS).

Walking with banners that read ‘Lets keep the light on HIV’ – the theme for their campaign, the rally was followed by a memorial meeting at the APSACS office at Sultan Bazar. More than 500 people and 25 non-governmental organisations were also present to show their support.

The International AIDS Candlelight Memorial, coordinated by the Global Network of People living with HIV is one of the world’s oldest and largest grassroots mobilisation campaigns for HIV awareness. Started in 1983, it takes place every third Sunday in May.
