
It is not the first time Border Security has been involved in a robbery where shots were fired.

In 2002, a security guard was peppered by a shotgun blast during what police called a brazen and brutal armed robbery at the Currumbin RSL.

While the guard lived, he needed surgery to remove shotgun pellets from his face, left hand and arm.

Police said two balaclava-clad bandits, one armed with a single-barrelled shotgun, grabbed more than $70,000 in two days’ takings and the security guard’s CZ 85 semiautomatic pistol as they swooped on the popular club in Currumbin Creek Road that Monday afternoon.

They fled in a stolen Ford sedan, which they swapped for another Ford nearby.

Police described the robbery as brazen, brutal and professional.

No one has ever been arrested for the heist which netted a total of more than $70,000.

Police said the cash pick-up went terribly wrong when the guard was parked at the RSL.

One bandit tried to use his gun to smash the driver’s side window before firing a single shot through he glass.

The driver copped the force of the blast in his face and arms.

Founded in 1976, Border Security began as a small operation covering upper NSW and later expanding to Tweed Heads, according to the company website.

It later expanded to the Gold Coast and claims to be one of the leading service providers in the security industry.

The company offers fully qualified and licensed armed guards to escort staff, cash and valuables.

It also manages site specific risk assessment to minimise the risk to staff, customers and valuables.
