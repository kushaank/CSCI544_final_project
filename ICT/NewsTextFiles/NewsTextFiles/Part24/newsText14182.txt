
Albuquerque's city council is expected to discuss and vote on a mental health task force Monday.

The task force proposal has so far been well received. It would be made up of elected officials, government leaders and medical experts and work to solve what many call a crisis in New Mexico.

The task force would identify behavioral health problems, establish ways to help improve the situation, find resources for those who are facing mental health problems and find the funding to make everything operate. Once there is a mental health plan in place, the task force would evaluate how things are going and make changes if necessary.

Several people spoke when the task force proposal was announced, including two Bernalillo County commissioners and several city councilors. Two state senators were also present and spoke in favor of the task force.

According to Commissioner Wayne Johnson, 48 percent of Metropolitan Detention Center inmates are being treated for mental health problems. He said that is about 900 to 1,000 people every day.

"That is the worst possible place for someone with mental health issues," he said.

Yet, Albuquerque Police told Action 7 News that they don't have many other options. If they come across someone who is mentally ill but committing a crime, the only place they can take the person is MDC.

No one has said when the task force would get to work.

City council meets at 5 p.m. at Civic Plaza.
