
A bomb blast in the northern Nigerian city of Kano has killed five people, including the bomber.

Police say, the blast happened in a street with many bars and night clubs.

According to witnesses, the explosion was caused by a bomb in a car in the predominantly Christian area of Sabon Gari.

Reports say, the blast was so powerful that, all that remained of the car was engine.

The bombing comes as the Nigerian authorities continue the search for more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram.

Meanwhile, an African leaders' meeting in Paris at the weekend agreed to wage "war" on Boko Haram, pledging to share intelligence and co-ordinate action against the group.
