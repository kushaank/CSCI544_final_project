
Sunrise police are searching for a mother and her 2-year-old daughter who were last seen two weeks ago.

An arrest warrant has been issued for Megan Elizabeth Everett for kidnapping. Police say Everett, who turned 22 Monday, may be driving a 1999 four-door silver Saturn with a Florida tag of 421MLE.

According to authorities, Robert Baumann notified Sunrise police on May 13 that he and Everett have an ongoing child custody battle over their daughter Lilly. Baumann told police that when he went to pick up Lilly in accordance with their visitation schedule, he was unable to get in touch with Everett.

Police say this may have been a planned kidnapping, in which Everett has taken measures to conceal her identity and Lilly's.

Authorities ask anyone who has information about Everett or Lilly's whereabouts to contact the Sunrise Police Department at 954-746-3600 or Broward County Crime Stoppers at 954-493-8477.
