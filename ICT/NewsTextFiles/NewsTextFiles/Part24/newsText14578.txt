Moving to Delaware has been somewhat of a homecoming for Shirley, a Radnor, Pa., native. Shirley got her start in television in Philadelphia, reporting traffic for WTXF-TV/Fox 29 and as a reporter for what's now the CW affiliate. Shirley graduated from New York University with a degree in broadcast journalism and East Asian studies. She and her family live in Wilmington and in her off time, Shirley enjoys yoga, eating (foodie alert!) and spending time with her husband and son.

A Delaware correctional officer was arrested over the weekend for allegedly plotting to smuggle marijuana and cell phones into a Smyrna prison.

Internal Affairs investigators with Delaware's Dept. of Correction tipped off state police, Saturday, after they uncovered a scheme involving Darryl West, Jr. of Bridgeville. Internal Affairs said the correctional officer and a sentenced inmate at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center were in cahoots to smuggle contraband into the jail.

West, police said, made contact with the inmate's associate and set up a meeting, but was only given $700 in cash.

Troopers arrested West on Saturday without incident and charged him with Possession with Intent to Deliver Marijuana, Possession with Intent to Deliver Prison Contraband to Person Confined within Detention Facility and Conspiracy.

When asked about West's employment status, Painter said via email, "effective May 17, 2014, Mr. West was removed from the workplace without pay."

West remains in custody at Howard R. Young Correctional Institution on $15,000 secured bond.
