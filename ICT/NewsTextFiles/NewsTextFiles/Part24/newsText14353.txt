LOWER POTTSGROVE � Sources confirmed Monday that a girl was hit by a Norfolk Southern freight train while she was walking along the tracks near the Home Depot Saturday evening.

The Lower Pottsgrove incident was the second of two in which pedestrians were struck by Norfolk Southern trains Saturday. That morning, two males walking along tracks near the former Valley Forge National Historical Park train station at the foot of the Betzwood bridge were struck and killed instantly by a freight train around 7:35 a.m., according to Upper Merion police. The two men were walking in the middle of the westbound tracks when they were hit, according to police.

According to a source close to the investigation of the Lower Pottsgrove incident, the girl turned up at Pottstown Memorial Medical Center to be treated for injuries after the incident which occurred around 6:30 p.m. Saturday. It was unknown where she went after she was allegedly hit or how she ended up at the hospital.

Lower Pottsgrove police, who assisted at the scene along with Pottstown police, referred all questions Monday to Norfolk Southern police, who are investigating the incident.

Police at the scene Saturday said the incident allegedly occurred along tracks near Armand Hammer Boulevard and the Home Depot in Lower Pottsgrove. A conductor on the train reported seeing the girl walking on the tracks before hearing a thump. According to Norfolk Southern Manager of Public Relations Dave Pidgeon, the train stopped after the incident and remained on the tracks during the search for the girl.

The track speed in the area of the incident is set at 50 miles per hour, but Pidgeon could not say how fast the train was going at the time of the incident. The train, which had three locomotives and 90 empty cars attached, was heading west when the incident occurred.

Pidgeon could not say if the trains were halted on the eastbound tracks but did say no other trains were run on the westbound tracks while the train was stopped and to accommodate the investigation.

�We want to do what we can to help any kind of investigation,� said Pidgeon.

Pidgeon said the investigation was ongoing and could give no further details Monday afternoon.

Thomas Algatt, state coordinator of Pennsylvania Operation Lifesaver, said all train track rights-of-way are private property and anyone found walking on them could be charged with trespassing. Pennsylvania Operation Lifesaver is a nonprofit, nationwide public education program aimed at eliminating collisions, deaths and injuries.

Algatt said he was not familiar with the investigation into Saturday�s incident, but said it would be up to the investigating officers to decide whether the girl struck Saturday would be charged.

According to the Pennsylvania Operation Lifesaver website (www.oliofpa.org), the number of pedestrians injured or killed while walking along railroad tracks in the nation increased by 7.7 percent from 2012 to 2013 to 908. Pennsylvania ranks fifth in the nation for rail trespasser casualties, according to the data, with 19 fatalities and 25 injuries last year. The state is 22nd in the nation for grade-crossing casualties last year with four fatalities and 20 injuries. A total of 1,193 people were injured or killed nationwide at railroad grade crossings in 2013, according to the data.
