
Who says the police are inefficient or unhelpful? There was a false alarm about the theft of my car from a wedding function in Fizaya colony, Airport Road in Islamabad.

I called 15 to report the theft. The airport police station SHO was at the spot within half an hour. Soon it was discovered that it was unfortunately a false alarm. The police were informed and they immediately arrived to reconfirm before calling of the alarm. I have not seen this kind of efficiency before this incident. Hats off to the Rawalpindi police â€“ keep up the good job.
