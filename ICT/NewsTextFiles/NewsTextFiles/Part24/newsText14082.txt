Coral Gables, Fla.-based Turbana; its social foundation, Fundauniban; and the Rotary Club of Uraba, Colombia, have teamed with doctors in the U.S. and Colombia to provide free surgeries for economically challenged people in Uraba, according to a Turbana news release.

As part of the effort, dubbed “New Smiles for Urabá,” 52 surgeries were completed in the first half of April.

Problems association with cleft palate and split lip include eating troubles, cavities, malformed teeth, frequent ear infections, hearing loss and speech impediments.

Turbana donated $5,000 this year to be used for medical equipment and anesthesia for the surgeries.

Fundauniban has helped fund and support cleft lip and split palate surgeries and recoveries for 11 years. Fundauniban helps recovering patients with speech therapy programs, personal growth activities, self-esteem workshops and support groups.

More than 900 surgeries have been performed since the program’s launch.
