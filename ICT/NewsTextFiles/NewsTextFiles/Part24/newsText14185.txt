The Delaware State Police is investigating a home invasion that occurred Sunday night in the 28000 block of Russell Street in Millsboro.

Police said around 11:30 p.m., two black suspects with bandanas over their faces entered the residence, which was occupied by three males – ages 35, 28 and 24 – and two females – ages 40 and 13. Police said the 35-year-old and the 28-year-old fled by jumping out of windows. The 24-year-old was assaulted by the suspects, who may have discharged a firearm while in the residence. Police said the suspects took money from the 24-year-old, who eventually escaped by jumping out of a window. The suspects then fled.

Police said the 24-year-old was treated at a nearby hospital for a non-life threatening head injury. No one else was injured. Police have determined this was not a random act, and the victims were targeted in the home invasion.
