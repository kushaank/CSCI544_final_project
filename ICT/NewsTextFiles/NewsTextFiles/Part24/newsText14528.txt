
Members of the Creve Coeur City Council first paid homage to the First Amendment, then decided there are times when safety trumps it.

Councilmembers, at their May 12 meeting, voted unanimously to approve an ordinance stating that medians are part of the road. As such, the ordinance says, pedestrians only should use medians when they are crossing the road.

The council passed the measure mainly to deal with protestors who often stand on the median outside the Monsanto World Headquarters on Olive Boulevard between Lindbergh Boulevard and Warson Road.  Police Chief Glenn Eidman has expressed concern about what happens when they walk out to the median and pass out brochures to motorists.

“This in itself has been a safety concern, as they are too close to the roadway for vehicles traveling at speeds of up to 40 miles per hour,” the chief said in a recent memo to City Administrator Mark Perkins.

Protest leaders also at the May 12 meeting said the new law violates free speech, and that there are other ways to deal with people who go into the roadway.

“It creates more of a way to stifle dissent,” William Smith, a member of the local organizing committee for the March Against Monsanto, said.

Making it illegal to be in the median will limit the group’s ability to be anywhere, Smith said.

Smith said protesters would be out during another march on May 24.

Marches are planned for 400 cities in 52 countries around the world advocating permanent boycotts of Genetically Modified Organisms and other agro-chemicals they consider dangerous.

Creve Coeur City Administrator Mark Perkins said demonstrations aren’t the only reason the council passed the ordinance.

“This is certain to address safety concerns in addition to that issue,” he said.

At the May 12 meeting, Eidman showed a video of a demonstration on the median next to the Monsanto headquarters that showed some protesters stepping out into the street.
