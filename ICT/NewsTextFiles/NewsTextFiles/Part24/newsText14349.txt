GULFPORT, Mississippi -- A 26-year-old Gulfport mother has been arrested after authorities say she repeatedly punched a Head Start teacher's assistant and pulled her hair.

Authorities responded to the incident at Isaiah Fredricks Head Start, 3410 Jackson St., after the assault was reported.

The patrol division learned that Dawson had arrived at the school "belligerent and irate" after the teacher's assistant refused to release Dawson's child to an unfamiliar individual at a bus stop.

During a conversation near the bus, Dawson punched the victim multiple times and pulled her hair before removing the child from the bus and fleeing the scene.

Dawson was later located and arrested. She was transported to the Harrison County Adult Detention Facility on $25,000 in bail.
