May 19, Colombo: A Sri Lankan court today granted bail to 13 university students arrested by the police last Friday for staging a protest defying police and court orders.

Colombo Chief Magistrate Thilina Gamage released nine of the 13 students on two sureties of Rs.100,000 each while the remaining four, who were injured when the police assaulted the protesting students, were hospitalized at the Colombo National Hospital.

The Judge reprimanded the police for assaulting the students during the arrest. The police spokesman said earlier the police have used "minimum force" necessary to control the situation.

The Magistrate warned the police to be more responsible and restrained when handling such situations involving students.

The police arrested 18 university students when the students, their parents and the members of the Inter University Students' Federation (IUSF) staged a peaceful demonstration opposite the University Grants Commission on Friday to protest the government's proposal to reduce the course duration of the Allied Health Science Degree programme from four years to three years.

The IUSF said they would file a complaint with the Human Right Commission on the assaults by the police.
