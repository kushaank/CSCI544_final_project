The inspection of the Central Secretariat-Mandi House stretch, part of Phase III of the Delhi Metro network, by Metro railway safety officials has begun. Officials from the Commissioner of Metro Railway Safety (CMRS) are currently assessing the line, sources said.

The deputies of CMRS are currently inspecting the line and will submit a report to the CMRS shortly, after which the CMRS himself will inspect it. After he clears it, the line will be opened for commuters, a source said.

He added that it was highly likely that the entire process would be concluded before the end of this month.

The stretch, which was slated to be opened by April first week, has already been delayed by almost two months on account of delayed construction work and the general elections.
