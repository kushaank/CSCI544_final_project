
AUCKLAND – Two Pakistani women found dead at a west Auckland home had suffered stab wounds, quoting police foreign media reported on Monday.

A double homicide investigation is now underway following the discovery of the bodies of the women, one aged in her mid-50s and the other in her late teens, at a residential address in Ranui.

Detective Inspector Greg Cramer said that the women, who are believed to have been in a family relationship, had suffered stab wounds. He said that the police were called to the scene shortly after 10am by a man living at the house.

The 55-year-old man is now assisting police with their inquiries, however, he is not in custody. “We believe there is a relationship between the deceased women and the male occupier of the house also,” the police officer said.

Cramer said a couple lived at the house but at times there were up to four people living there. The bodies removed from the house for post-mortem examination. A full scene examination is underway and is expected to take several days.

Police have not been called out to the house before today. Rob Nixon, who lives next door to the address, told the media that he didn’t hear anything unusual this morning. He was alerted to trouble when police and ambulance staff arrived.

He described the couple living at the address as friendly and said they had a number of children.
