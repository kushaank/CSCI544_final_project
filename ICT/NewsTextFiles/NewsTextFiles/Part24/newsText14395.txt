Burglary suspects caught in the act in N. Harris Co.

A group of burglary suspects didn't get far after smashing their way into a north Harris County home and ransacking the place Monday afternoon.

The house is a mess, the aftermath of a burglary in which the suspects took everything they could.

"Four TVs, a DVD," said Jessica.  "My husband's watches. Everything, bracelets, rings."

The suspects have been identified as Kenneth Soliz, 20; Tracy Nelloms, 17; Jose Luis Duran, 21; and Martin Barcenas-Benitez, 18.

The four suspects broke in through the back door and tried to take four TVs, various electronics and jewelry.   But they didn't get far.

A neighbor called 911 and sheriff's deputies responded before the suspects even pulled out of the driveway.

"Thank you so much for paying attention and realizing they were next door," said Lydia.   "So just thanks."

Neighbor Geno Simmons recounted how deputies drew their weapons to get the men to surrender.

"They just came out the car and said, 'Get out the car.  Get out the car.  Put your hands up,'" he said.

Once they were under arrest, the sisters discovered something unusual.  They say at least one of the suspects used to live in the home, until the sisters purchased the house last year.
