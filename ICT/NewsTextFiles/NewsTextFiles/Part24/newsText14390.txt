
Two men were shot Monday afternoon in the Ivy City neighborhood of Northeast Washington, near Gallaudet University and in an area that has a mix of residences and industry, according to D.C. police.

One of the men was seriously wounded in the 3:30 p.m. shooting that occurred in the 1800 block of Corcoran Street NE. Police said the other victim ran across a bridge over New York Avenue, one of the District’s busiest roads, and collapsed at Brentwood and W streets, near the Rhode Island Metro station.

Police released few immediate details and no arrest or description of the gunman was available.

The shootings occurred a little more than a mile from where five people were shot and wounded early Saturday. That incident occurred near Queens Chapel Road and Adams Place Northeast, in the area of several nightclubs.

Police could not say on Monday whether there is any connection to the two incidents.
