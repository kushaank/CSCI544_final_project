
Boulder police today announced they are no longer looking for a masked man or a car like those seen in the movie "Grease" following a woman's report that she was grabbed by an assailant and sexually assaulted more than a week ago.

Police said in a news release Monday that they do not believe there is any danger to the public.

Kim Kobel, a Boulder police spokeswoman, declined to elaborate, saying the investigation is still ongoing.

The assault occurred at 12:20 a.m. May 11 in the 2000 block of 26th Street. The woman said she was leaving her workplace when a man wearing a ski mask grabbed her from behind "bear-hug style," dragged her to a nearby car and sexually assaulted her, according to police.

The woman said her attacker was muscular, of unknown height and wore a long-sleeve, collared, polo-style shirt and pants made of rough fabric. Police said the man had a deep voice, no accent and wore cologne.

The victim initially described the car as "an older, boxy car like the vehicles in the movie 'Grease,'" police said. The car was light colored, had two bucket seats and had "an old-style radio in it," according to police.

Police ask that anyone with information about the case call Detective Brannon Winn at 303-441-4477.

Those who have information but who wish to remain anonymous may contact the Northern Colorado Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477) or 1-800-444-3776.
