
A number of people are lucky to have escaped serious injury after four vehicles were hit in separate sling-shot attacks near an overhead bridge.

It's lucky no-one has been killed or injured after rocks were launched like missiles from an overhead bridge in the Blue Mountains, hitting cars, a minibus and a van on the Great Western Highway west of Sydney.

Police say there were at least four separate apparent sling-shot attacks on the weekend apparently from an overhead railway bridge at Lapstone.

A 52-year-old woman has cuts on her lips and chin after a large rock shattered the window of the car she was travelling in on the highway at about 9am on Sunday.

A short time later, a 43-year-old man and his seven-year-old daughter were lucky to avoid injury after their car was hit by a large rock at the same location.

Police said a minibus was also struck with a large rock as it neared the overhead bridge at about the same time.

A homemade slingshot was found in bush near the bridge.

The incidents on Sunday came after a similar attack at the same location at about 4pm on Saturday in which a rock struck the windscreen of a van with 19 passengers on board. No-one was injured.

Police are appealing for anyone who witnessed the incidents or any suspicious behaviour in the area to come forward.
