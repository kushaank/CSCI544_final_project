
HYDERABAD: The Cyber Crime police busted a three-member credit card cloning gang on Monday. The Hyderabad Cyber Crime team arrested Michael Dominic, a tailor from Austin Town, Anglo Indian Quarters in Shanthi Nagar, Bangalore, Shree Kumar Narayan Nair, a businessman from Mumbai, and Chowrappa Bala Raju, a legal adviser from Chamarajpet in Bangalore.

According to Central Crime Station (CCS) deputy commissioner of police (DCP) G Pala Raju, the prime accused, Michael Dominic, had been collecting particulars of international credit cards through Bala Raju, Gopi from Chennai and Kevin Vino from London.

"After collecting the details from the trio, Michael used to write them on to empty magnetic strip cards and distribute them to his two other associates. The accused would then swipe the cloned cards in electronic data capture (EDC) machines at business establishments of merchants known to them by paying some commission," the DCP said.

CCS police nabbed the trio in Koti while they were trying to use the cards on Monday. Cops seized a laptop, an encoder machine and 16 cloned credit cards from them. The trio was produced in court and remanded in judicial custody.
