
Colombian authorities confirmed on Monday that the number of casualties from the bus fire is up to thirty-three.

The victims, all children, died after the bus they were riding in caught fire on their way back from a religious service on Sunday near the town of Fundacion, which is located in northern Colombia.

The cause of the fire is not yet known.

“Authorities in Colombia are trying to piece together what led to the death of 33 children when an overcrowded bus they were traveling in caught fire,” reported the AP.

“President Juan Manuel Santos traveled Sunday night to the town of Fundacion near the Caribbean coast to pay his respects to the mostly poor families of the victims. He declared a national day of mourning,” they added.

The ages of the children on the bus ranged from two to twelve years of age.

“‘The injured have second and third-degree burns, and many are still in a critical condition’ in hospitals in the area and in the city of Santa Marta, Urena said,” reported AFP.

“Fundacion Mayor Luz Stella Duran said that – according to survivors – the bus driver had been handling a container with gasoline aboard the vehicle. Police initially blamed the fire on a mechanical problem,” they added.

The driver of the bus, according to Colombian newspaper El Tiempo, did not have a drivers license and the bus was not well maintained.

He turned himself voluntarily in on Monday after locals went to the drivers’ house and began throwing rocks at the windows.
