
GURGAON: The  DLF City Residents' Welfare Association has put a 3-tier security system into place for DLF phases 1 to 4. Security measures include the deployment of guards, installment of CCTVs at all access gates and formation of a quick response team (QRT).

"CCTV cameras are now operational. The number of security guards has been increased from 244 to 345. And a team of 84 QRT guards is also patrolling the area," said Sudhir Kapoor, secretary general, DLF City RWA.

Many feel that CCTV cameras act as a deterrent for the criminals. Manpreet Kaur, DLF Phase III resident said, "CCTV is the best way to keep an eye on any suspicious activity. It definitely gives us a sense of security."

The cameras have night vision and are installed in a way so that the number plates of the vehicles entering the area can be easily read. "We have set up a control room in our DLF I office to monitor the live footage round the clock. Interestingly, the footage can be retained for over two months, which can help in the police investigation, in case of any criminal activity" said Anil Sharma, head of security, DLF City RWA. Each QRT guard is given a designated area.
