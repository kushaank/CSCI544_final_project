
A Mexican hitch-hiker was robbed at gunpoint in Hawke's Bay this afternoon.

The  30-year-old man was picked up on State Highway 2 at the Napier-Taupo  Road turnoff, just north of Napier by three men in a ute.

The car was driven north towards Wairoa and stopped at Tutira for petrol.

The  driver pulled the car over at the top of the Mohaka Hill near Raupunga  about 2.30pm. The tourist was ordered out of the car with one of the  car's occupants pointing a pistol at him.

The car, which was carrying the hitch-hiker's possessions, including a cellphone and a camera, then drove away.
