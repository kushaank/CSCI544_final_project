
VOLUSIA COUNTY, FL (WKMG) - Volusia County deputies said a mother and daughter were reunited last weekend after a parental kidnapping four years ago.

Deputies said Jodie Borchert had legal custody of her daughter in 2009, when her daughter was 8 years old.

Deputies said during a regular weekend visitation with her father, Aaron Cox, the daughter went missing, along with Cox.

Borchert filed a missing persons report with the Volusia County Sheriff's Office in August 2009.

Deputies immediately issued an arrest warrant for Cox, charging him with interference with child custody.

For nearly four years there were no viable leads, but investigators never gave up hope that the child would one day be found.

Deputies were able to find out through a tip to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children  that the girl, who is now 12 years old, and Cox were spotted in Mexico.

As deputies worked with national and international agencies, they were able to find Cox and the girl in the remote mountains of Hidalgo, Mexico.

Authorities were able to arrest Cox and learned he had been living under assumed names with no known ties to Mexico.

Borchert and her daughter were reunited in Miami and authorities were working to extradite Cox back to Volusia County.
