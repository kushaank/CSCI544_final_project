
Sharjah Police has arrested an Ethiopian maid for allegedly stealing Dh275,000 from her employers and fleeing the place.

Initial investigation reveals she committed the crime with the help of another maid and a man of the same nationality from the house of an Iraqi family where she works.

The incident came to light when Al Gharb Police Station was informed about the theft by the Iraqi man.

He filed a complaint  stating that Dh275,000 and three mobile phones were stolen from his house in Sharjah.

The CID team was informed  by the owner that his family had trusted the maid and she knew where they kept money and valuables. They were shocked to learn she had stolen the money and ran away.

Upon arrest she denied the accusation.

Meanwhile, the CID also questioned another part-time maid who worked at the house, who confessed to the crime. The second maid said they took revenge on the Iraqi man’s wife because she picked up fights with them.

Police confiscated Dh20,000 and two mobile phones from the second maid. She also told police that she had handed over the rest of the cash to a man who would help them sent the money to their home country.

The man – the third suspect – was also arrested after that. He denied knowledge of the crime the maids have committed.

He handed over the stolen money and said that he only knew one of the maids because he  used to transport her to various locations in Sharjah and she used to pay him.

The three suspects will be referred to the Public Prosecution.
