
BRIDGEPORT -  Employees of a Papa John's pizzeria in Bridgeport have released surveillance video showing two robbers entering the restaurant and making off with cash.

It happened Sunday night at the location on Main Street at around midnight. Officials say that one of the suspects was carrying a gun.

Employees say they were forced to lie on the ground at gunpoint while the robbers packed money from the cash register and employee wallets into pizza boxes before storming out.

Business owners and neighbors say that armed robberies in the area happen too often.

While the search is on to find the robbers, Papa John's managers say that their doors will remained locked once the sun goes down to assure their safety going forward.

Bridgeport police ask anyone with information to call them immediately.
