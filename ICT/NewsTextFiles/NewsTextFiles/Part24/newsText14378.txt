A 27-year-old Bridgeville man who is a correctional officer at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center has been charged in connection to a plan to smuggle marijuana and cell phones into the Smyrna prison.

According to the Delaware State Police, an investigation began on Saturday after Department of Correction Internal Affairs investigators uncovered a scheme involving Darryl L. West and an inmate at JTVCC to smuggle contraband into the prison. Police said it was determined the inmate had made arrangements for West to meet with an associate outside of the prison to obtain marijuana and cell phones in exchange for $800.

Police said the plan was for West to smuggle the contraband into the prison and drop it at a predetermined location, where it would be picked up by another inmate and delivered to the conspiring inmate. Police said a search of Westâ€™s car yielded 113.2 grams of marijuana, two Nokia cell phones and $700 in cash.

West was taken into police custody on Saturday and was charged with possession with intent to deliver marijuana, possession with intent to deliver prison contraband to a person confined within detention facility and second degree conspiracy. West was committed to Howard R. Young Correctional Institution on $15,000 secured bond.
