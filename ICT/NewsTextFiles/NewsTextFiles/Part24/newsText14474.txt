
INDORE: Senior superintendent of  Jhabua police on Monday has ordered exhumation of the bodies of three children who died of measles outbreak in Meghnagar block of the district earlier this month.

SP Singh has taken a special permission of sub-divisional magistrate to conduct postmortem for speedy action in the matter. "On the basis of postmortem report and evidences, action will be taken on the negligent staff of health department," said Singh.

Action was taken after lapses were found on part of employees posted with chief medical and health officer (CMHO) and anganwadi workers. Though the Jhabua collector had ordered registration of FIR immediately after the three deaths, Kakanwani police did the needful against five accused on late Sunday night.

With the postmortem likely to be conducted on Tuesday, arrest of all five accused is possible in a couple of days. Earlier this month, measles had claimed three lives and affected more than 150 children in Jhabua and Barwani districts. A comprehensive report of the entire episode was sent to directorate of health services in Bhopal.
