
Tyquan Davis and a 16-year-old are suspected of trying to steal a car in West Haven.

West Haven police arrested two teens suspected of trying to steal a car thanks to an off-duty police who saw some suspicious activity early Monday morning.

Police responded to First Avenue and Spring Streets around 12:30 a.m. after the off-duty officer noticed two people dressed in dark clothing and masks, police said.

They ran when they saw police, but stopped and surrendered when police brought K-9 “Ike” into the mix, according to a news release from police.

One of the teens arrested is 16 years old, so his name was not released. The other was identified as Tyquan Davis, 19, of New Haven.

Police said he is a convicted sex offender who was on probation.  According to the state’s sex offender registry, he was convicted for third-degree sexual assault on Aug. 6, 2013 and was released on Nov. 29.

Davis was held on $5,000 bond.
