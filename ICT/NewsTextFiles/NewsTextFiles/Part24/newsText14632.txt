
The United Nations flew life-saving equipment to Belgrade shortly before midnight and another plane with emergency food and water supplies was expected today, the Serbian Interior Ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.

Serbia declared a state of emergency on May 15 in the wake of rainfall-triggered floods that left 17 dead in the largest former Yugoslav republic, 16 in neighboring Bosnia and one in Croatia. Governments were still calculating the impact and Serbia has turned to Russia and the European Union for emergency assistance as the rains ruined homes, roads, dams, railroads and crops of wheat and corn.

Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic and neighboring Bulgaria and Turkey are among countries offering assistance.

In Serbia, about 25,000 people were evacuated and 26,000 homes left without electricity overnight, while rescuers struggled to save towns and villages along swelling rivers and keep water away from the main power generating facilities near Belgrade, the Interior Ministry said in e-mail today.
