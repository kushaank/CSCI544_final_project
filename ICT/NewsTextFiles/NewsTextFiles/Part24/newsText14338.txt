MINEOLA, N.Y. (CBSNewYork) — The Nassau County Legislature on Monday passed a bill that would establish an online registry of people convicted of animal abuse.

As 1010 WINS’ Mona Rivera reported the bill would forbid people on the registry from purchasing animals in the Long Island county.

“I look forward to signing this bill into law,” Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano said after the legislature signed the bill unanimously.

Presiding Officer Norma Gonsalves said abusers will have to register within five days of their convictions.

“The online database would be maintained by the Nassau County SPCA,” she explained.

County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Detective Gary Rogers lauded the passage of the legislation.

“It’s a great day for Nassau County,” he said.

Those convicted of abuse will have their name, photo and address displayed on an abuse website and they will not be allowed to buy adopt or buy an animal once the animal abuse registry goes into effect.

Failure to register could land a person in jail for a year, under the statute.

Suffolk County has had an animal abuse registry since 2010.
