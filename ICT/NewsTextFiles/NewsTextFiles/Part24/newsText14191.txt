WALDO, Maine — A Waldo County man awaits his next court appearance on charges that he sexually assaulted three different people, including a toddler.

Jason Brown, 47, of Waldo was charged in April after an investigation by the Maine State Police which began after the 23-month-old started acting strangely when her diaper was changed. She told her father that she had been hurt in her “private area,” according to the probable cause affidavit filed on April 23 by Detective Scott Bryant.

When her father asked who had hurt her, the toddler allegedly named Brown, who is a relative.

During the investigation, another woman told police that Brown also had sexually assaulted her in 2004 when she was 12.

“She said all she wanted to do was cry but couldn’t,” Bryant wrote in the affidavit, on file at the Waldo County District Court. When Brown tried to assault her again later, she kicked him and got away, according to the document.

The woman also told police that another woman told her that she too had been sexually assaulted by Brown in April of this year. Police then interviewed the second alleged adult victim, who told them that Brown had grabbed and inappropriately touched her bottom and upper thighs on April 18 before she was able to get away.

When Bryant and Detective Chris Tremblay interviewed Brown at his garage in Waldo, he denied touching either woman sexually. He denied having touched the toddler.

Brown was arrested on April 19 and charged with Class B unlawful sexual contact against a child, Class C unlawful sexual contact against a child and Class D unlawful sexual touching.
