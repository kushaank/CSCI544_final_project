
KOTA KINABALU: After six days of questioning by police, the parents of missing toddler Low Min You still could not provide any clue as to where the boy is.

Low Yee Sheng, 31, and Yong Siou Yee, 26, and Yee Sheng’s friend, a 31-year-old man who had been remanded since May 14 to facilitate investigations into the case, were taken to court and granted police bail yesterday morning.

All three were initially ordered to be remanded for three days, starting May 14, but were further remanded on May 17 for more questioning.

Min You was reported missing at about 5.50am on May 9.

He was apparently sleeping in his father’s vehicle that was parked near a petrol kiosk in downtown Kota Kinabalu city as the latter rushed to use the restroom.

However, investigations re­­vealed that Min You had actually gone missing an hour earlier at a different location.

Sabah Police Commissioner Datuk Hamza Taib and Kota Kinabalu city police chief Assist Comm Jauteh Dikun could not be reached for comment.

Hamza had said on Sunday that Min You might still be alive, though he did not elaborate further.

The police are expected to hold a press conference over the missing boy today.

Please wait.
