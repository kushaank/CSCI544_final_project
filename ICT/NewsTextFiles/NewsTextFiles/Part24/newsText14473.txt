OGDEN â€” An Ogden man was charged Monday with luring a 13-year-old girl walking home from school into his apartment and sexually abusing her.

Dan Thompson, 59, was charged in 2nd District Court with aggravated sexual abuse of a child, a first-degree felony.

Ogden police believe Thompson had attempted to entice the young girl, who has walked alone the same way to and from school all year, prior to assaulting her. On April 29, Thompson finally convinced the girl to go into his apartment, according to a police affidavit. Once inside the apartment, the girl was allegedly abused.

As of Monday, Ogden Police Lt. Danielle Croyle said there was no evidence of any other victims. But if someone is a victim or knows of somebody who is, she said they can call police at 801-629-8221.
