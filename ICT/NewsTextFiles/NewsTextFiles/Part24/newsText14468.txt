
KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The man suspected of numerous highway shootings in the Kansas City area pleaded not guilty on Monday, May 19.

Mohammed Whitaker, 27, of Grandview, Mo., appeared before a judge wearing a suit and appearing every bit the part of a young businessman. He pleaded not guilty to 20 felonies.

Police said Whitaker is responsible for at least nine different highway shootings. Seven of those occurred on Kansas City roadways and around the Grandview Triangle between March 18 and April 6, 2014.

Police received more than 100 tips from victims and witnesses, who said the person responsible was driving erratically and operating a green Dodge Neon. Police also said they lifted a finger print matching Whitaker’s from a plastic bag of shell casings, linking him to the crimes. Still, Whitaker insists he’s innocent.

Whitaker is expected to appear in court again on June 6.

What an idiot.  Not only does he deserve to be locked up, but by playing dumb to the evidence stacked against him, will only increase his jail time.  So go ahead, plead not guilty.  The general public will be the ones to reap the benefits.

I agree Ken.

Also keep wondering why the Feds haven’t charged him with Domestic Terrorism.
