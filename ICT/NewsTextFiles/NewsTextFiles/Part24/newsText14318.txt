The de Blasio administration is putting an upgrade of the city's 911 system on hold and ordering a comprehensive review of the entire system.

It's reviewing why the project has fallen behind, and nearly a billion dollars over budget.

The project, which began under Mayor Bloomberg, was supposed to modernize the system and improve communication between fire, police, and EMS.

But glitches in the system have been blamed for delays in response times.

The de Blasio administration began a thorough review of the project in the administration's first days in office, including an exploration of its history, scope, budget and the multiple changes to its schedule.

"Our number one priority is protecting the safety of all New Yorkers," said Mayor de Blasio. "That means not only fixing the problems that have for too long plagued the ECTP, but also addressing new issues that demand immediate corrective action.  The critical steps we are taking today will ensure that the new emergency communications system is operationally, technologically and financially prepared to protect future generations here in New York City."
