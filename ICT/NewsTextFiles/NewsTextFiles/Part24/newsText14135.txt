
BOGOTA, Colombia –  Authorities in Colombia are trying to piece together what led to the death of 32 children when an overcrowded bus they were traveling in caught fire.

President Juan Manuel Santos traveled Sunday night to the town of Fundacion near the Caribbean coast to pay his respects to the mostly poor families of the victims. He declared a national day of mourning.

Another 22 children and adults suffered burns in the fire that took place Sunday as they were traveling home from an event at an evangelical church.

El Tiempo newspaper reported that the driver of the bus turned himself in Monday. Witnesses have said that he left the vehicle running when he went to fill the tank with gas from a portable container.
