
SAN ANTONIO — A girl, 6, died after being shot in the face late Sunday at her home on the East Side.

Jennilynn Montana was shot just before 10 p.m. in the 1400 block of Aransas Avenue, police said.

Jennilynn's mother was in the front of the house when she heard a gunshot from the back, according to the San Antonio Police Department . The mother followed the sound to find Jennilynn injured. She was pronounced dead about half an hour later.

As of Monday morning, police did not know whether Jennilynn shot herself or her sister, 8, pulled the trigger. A police spokesman said the ownership of the weapon was still under investigation.

Texas Child Protective Services spokeswoman Mary Walker confirmed Monday that the agency had opened its own investigation into the shooting.

The school planned to send letters home to parents to let them know “their children may have learned of the death of one of their fellow students” and offering suggestions for spotting signs of grief or trauma and how to respond, said San Antonio Independent School District spokeswoman Leslie Price .
