
If you never use a seat belt, today would be a great time to start.

State and local police across Allegheny County will join more than 500 law enforcement agencies in Pennsylvania and thousands more across the country to take part in National Click It or Ticket seat belt enforcement mobilization, which kicks off Monday  and runs through June 8.

North Versailles Township Police officer David Reiche, department coordinator for the Buckle Up PA program, said the purpose of the initiative is strictly to protect drivers.

Throughout the two-week mobilization, there will be an increased focus among police to crack down on offenders with checkpoints and roving patrols, mostly on high-traffic roadways and those where a large number of crashes occur.

Juliann Sheldon, safety press officer for PennDOT District 11, said 37 agencies and departments throughout the region will be actively involved with the initiative including police in Clairton, East McKeesport, Elizabeth Township, Homestead, Jefferson Hills, McKeesport, North Versailles, West Mifflin and White Oak.

She noted that children under the age of 4 must be properly restrained in an approved child safety seat, children from 4 to 8 must be in a booster seat and children 8 to 18 must wear a seat belt.

Sheldon said police will especially be out in force between 6 and 10 tonight.

Erin Waters-Trasatt, deputy press secretary for PennDOT, said campaigns like this are proven to be effective.

Waters-Trasatt said although the observed seat belt rate in Pennsylvania is 84 percent, which is above the 2013 National Occupant Protection Use Survey average of 80 percent for states with secondary seat-belt laws, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data showed that roughly 57 percent of occupants killed in vehicle crashes in the state during 2012 were not properly restrained.

But Sheldon said there's reason for optimism. She said the state's seat belt rate is among the highest in the U.S. and has increased 15 percent during the past decade.

Still, Elizabeth Township Police chief Robert McNeilly said there's plenty of room for improvement.

McNeilly said drivers and passengers shouldn't view Click It or Ticket as an inconvenience, but instead as a chance to make a positive change in their lives.
