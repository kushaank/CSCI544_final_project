
A Gering man pulled over for failing to use a turn signal is facing more than just a citation, after a Nebraska State Trooper finds illegal pills and marijuana.

On Friday night, 21-year-old D.J. Gibbons was pulled over in a traffic stop for failure to signal. The trooper was denied consent to search the vehicle because Gibbons said it belonged to his father. Court documents say the trooper was going to call for a K-9, and when a second trooper arrived on scene, they could smell marijuana emitting from the vehicle.

Troopers performed a probable cause search of the vehicle after Gibbons said there was not much marijuana in the vehicle. A search led to the discovery of baggies and pill bottle containing marijuana, glass pipes, digital scales, and pills.

Gibbons was arrested and charged with possession of a controlled substance, intent to deliver a controlled substance (schedule 1,2,3) possession of marijuana more than one ounce, less than one pound, possession of drug paraphernalia, and open container.

He will be arraigned on the charges on Monday afternoon in Scotts Bluff County Court.
