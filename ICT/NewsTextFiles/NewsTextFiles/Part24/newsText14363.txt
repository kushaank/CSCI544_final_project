
By 2020, the share of e-commerce in the common market of goods and services in Kazakhstan will be 10%. Today the index is only 2%. This was said at the opening of the international conference and exhibition ‘ASTEX-2014’ by Chairman of the Agency for Communications and Information Askar Zhumagaliyev. According to him, the e-commerce industry in Kazakhstan is growing, this year its total is $ 600 million. Innovative design and their application in business, e-commerce and logistics – all these and other questions were discussed today in Astana by heads of major media companies, investors, players in the world of Internet business. During the conference a memorandum of cooperation between Kazakhstan Infocomm Technology Development Fund, Techno Park Skolkovo and Muckerlab Fund was signed.

– These are very large funds, as you know the Skolkovo Foundation very seriously pays attention to the development of projects in the field of e-commerce, in the development of small enterprises. Therefore, we hope that by signing a memorandum today we attract investments from Skolkovo Foundation and our guys, who will offer interesting projects, can develop in Russia.

The exhibition presents the latest Kazakhstan IT projects, for example, technology of graphical visualization, 3-D printers and other innovative projects. One of the most striking developments was the work of the computer science laboratory of Nazarbayev University. They created an algorithm that allowed us to find an alternative way to control a robotic arm. If a traditional robot is controlled by a joystick or keyboard, this development allows you to set commands through a special costume that uses human motion capture technology.
