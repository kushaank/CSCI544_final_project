
A Tysons Corner movie theater is open Sunday as Fairfax County fire department officials continue to investigate the cause of a small explosion at the theater.

No one was injured during the incident or the rush to evacuate the theaters in the AMC Tysons Corner 16 complex at about 12:15 a.m. Sunday, said Lucy Caldwell, a police spokeswoman. Emergency dispatchers received a flurry of calls describing the sounds of firecrackers or gunshots which caused panicked patrons to flee the theater, she said.

The Fairfax County Fire Marshal is trying to determine the exact substance that was inside the bottles and how the devices ended up in the theater. Deputy chief Michael Reilly described the devices as “acid bombs” containing an explosive mixture of acid and metal.

“They don’t know if the person left it or threw it,” Caldwell said.
