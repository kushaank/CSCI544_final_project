The man accused of stabbing two women to death in west Auckland has made his first court appearance.

Ishrat Malik, a 55-year-old taxi driver, appeared in Waitakere District Court on Tuesday facing two murder charges.

It's alleged he murdered two women, believed to be a mother and a daughter, whose bodies were found with stab wounds in suburban Ranui on Monday morning.

Media reports named the women as Farhat Rana Malik, who is in her mid 50s, and Sidra Noor Malik, who is in her late teens.

Detective Inspector Greg Cramer on Monday wouldn't confirm the exact relationship between the accused and the victims but did say they had a family relationship and that they were of Pakistani ethnicity.

Malik was remanded in custody and will reappear in the High Court in Auckland next month.
