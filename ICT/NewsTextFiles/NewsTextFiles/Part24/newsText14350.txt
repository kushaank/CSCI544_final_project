LAS VEGAS --  Police in Las Vegas have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of an aspiring rapper in a posh suite at the Palms resort.

Metro police say 25-year-old Jim Edward Johnson was booked into jail about 10 a.m. Sunday on suspicion of murder in Thursday night's killing of 25-year-old Henderson resident Evan Plunkett.

Police say Plunkett had been involved in a fight with other men during a video shoot for a local hip-hop artist in the hotel's two-story Sky Villa suite. Police say about 50 people were there at the time.

The suspect told a friend that he dropped his gun, and it accidentally fired. Johnson initially left the scene but later turned himself in.

The victim served in the Marine Corps and rapped under the name "Hollywood Will."
