Hundreds of people attended a funeral Monday for Father Gilbert Dasna, Roman Catholic priest who was killed in St. Paul, Alta. ten days ago.

"People were touched by his simple goodness, simple life, faith and of trust in God," Pierre Lamoureux, spokesman for the Diocese of St. Paul, told CBC News. "That's the kind of man he was."

"The community is still confused about what really happened and I don't know if we really will know what happened until weeks or months to come," he said. "Maybe the real story will never come out."
