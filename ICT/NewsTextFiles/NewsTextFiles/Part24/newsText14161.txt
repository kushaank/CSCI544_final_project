
AN East Staffordshire woman has spoken of her horror after being attacked by a dog while out walking on a quiet country path.

Stephanie Colclough, who lives in Fauld Lane, Tutbury was out walking from Dovedale to Milldale with her husband when they came across the dog, which she believes was a Samoyed Husky at 3.30pm last Sunday.

The 43-year-old said the couple, who did not have dog of their own, approached a gate when they first noticed it sniffing around and that it was not on a lead. However when they opened the gate, the dog became more aggressive and started snarling at her.

Stephanie said: “As soon as it started snarling it jumped up. It was then that I thought it might attack me and try to sink its teeth in. I put my hands up to try and stop it. I’m about 5’6 but it was jumping up at my face.

As a result of the attack, Stephanie was left with heavy bruising around her ribs as well as a mark where the dog had bitten her. When she later went for treatment she was told that her injuries could have been a lot worse.

Derbyshire Constabulary is asking for anyone with information to contact PC Baggaley on the 101 number.
