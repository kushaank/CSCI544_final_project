
London: The Turkey police have arrested three persons involved in the Soma mine explosion, on account of multiple deaths due to the entry of carbon monoxide gas into the tunnels.

The police have detained 25 people, including numerous mining officials for interrogation, for the countryâ€™s worst mining disaster that claimed 301 lives.

Public prosecutor Bekir Sahiner said that the crime for which the suspects are accused includes causing multiple deaths and injuries due to negligence.

However, he did not reveal the identities of the arrested suspects.

It is still unclear whether the suspects would face charges as Soma Holdings maintains that the catastrophe was not caused due to inattention and carelessness.

According to the BBC, the catastrophe sparked anger across the country with protests growing in the western city of Izmir, Istanbul and Ankara.

Reports further added that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been criticized for his insensitive reaction following the disaster.

Meanwhile, it is reported that dozens of people were detained as they attempted to travel to the explosion site to offer their condolences.
