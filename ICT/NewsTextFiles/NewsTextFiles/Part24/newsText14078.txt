
Emergency officials in Colombia say at least 31 children were burned to death when their bus caught fire near the city of Fundacion.

Officials said the bus burst into flames Sunday while transporting children home from a church service. At least 20 other people were seriously burned and taken to hospitals.

Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, speaking at a campaign rally in Bogota, said he would immediately travel to Fundacion to console families of the victims.

The accident is being investigated.

Unconfirmed reports say the bus driver was handling a fuel container inside the cabin in an attempt to get the bus restarted when the fire broke out and spread quickly.
