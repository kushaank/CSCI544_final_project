
At least 31 young children and one adult were killed when an overcrowded bus  exploded into flames in a northern city in Colombia.

Some 50 children are thought to have been on the bus at the time of the  accident in the city of Fundación, which is about 750km (460 miles) north of  the capital, Bogotá.

Police said that the fire spread with such intensity that rescue teams  struggled to identify the number of dead, whose badly charred bodies are  being identified through dental records.
