
The police search of a Dunedin home on Friday provided no     major leads relating to the disappearance of a mother who went     missing 12 years ago, Detective Senior Sergeant Malcolm Inglis     said yesterday.

However, Snr Sgt Inglis, of Dunedin, who is leading the       investigation, said some new ''positive'' information had       been received when police made a call for information on       Friday.

Police reopened a cold case after suspecting foul play in the       disappearance of Tuitania (Tui) Marama Barclay in 2002.

Snr Sgt Inglis said Ms Barclay's former partner Bill Brown       was living in England, with the couple's two children.

When Ms Barclay disappeared, the two youngest children were       under the age of 2.

A month before Ms Barclay disappeared, she had indicated she was going to end her relationship with Mr Brown.

Police had not spoken to Mr Brown since the case had been       reopened.

Snr Sgt Inglis said Bill Brown was a common name in England,       which made finding him ''reasonably difficult''.

For now, the investigation was focused in New Zealand and       inquiries had been made in Waikato and Otago, he said.

''We've got an open mind to any scenarios; we can't close the       door on anything at this stage.''
