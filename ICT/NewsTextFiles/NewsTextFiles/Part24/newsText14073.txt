The bus was picking up children from an event at a church in Fundacion, Colombia, when the blaze began, Col. Adan Leon told CNN affiliate Caracol TV.

"Everyone started to scream and run," a child who was on the bus told Caracol, describing how he escaped through a window.

Victims of the deadly fire included 31 children and one adult, Harry Aaron, a civil defense official in Magdalena department, told CNN.

Authorities are investigating what caused the fire, Leon told Caracol.
