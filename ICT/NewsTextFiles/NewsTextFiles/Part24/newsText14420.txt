
Peyton Manning, 18, was arrested on drugs charges Sunday night in south Nashville.

Kenneth Sowards, 18, was also arrested.

A traffic stop in south Nashville Sunday night turned into a drug bust and the arrest of a woman with the same name as star quarterback Peyton Manning.

According to an affidavit, police pulled over Manning, 18, and Kenneth Sowards on Elm Hill Pike near Briley Parkway around 11 p.m. because their high beams were on in traffic.

Manning was behind the wheel while Sowards, who owns the vehicle, was in the passenger seat, police said.

Officers noticed a marijuana odor coming from the car and Sowards, also 18, gave police verbal permission to search it.

The affidavit states two plastic baggies with a white powdery substance inside were found floating in a cup of Coca-Cola sitting in the console. The substance field tested positive for cocaine.

In the back of the vehicle police found 44 grams of marijuana, a digital scale, and a pill crusher.

In addition, Manning’s and Sowards’ phones had messages on them about cocaine use and narcotic transactions, according to arrest warrants.

Police said Manning admitted that she knew marijuana was in the car and had used it in the past. Sowards admitted to selling the drugs for food and to pay bills.

The incident happened within 1,000 feet of a church so both have felony charges for possessing drugs in a drug-free zone, along with other drug charges.

Manning was booked into the Metro jail on $20,000 bond. Sowards’ bond was set at $30,000.

Both are due in court on Thursday.

Before social media came along, celebrities like Robin Williams kept many of their personal photos out of the public's eye. But these days, celebrities use sites like Instagram, Twitter and Facebook, to stay connected with their family, friends and fans.
