
Police are trying to figure out if a pair of shootings, less than a mile apart, are linked.

Investigators said one person was shot about 1:40 a.m. Monday near North 29th Street and Parallel Parkway. They say they don't know how serious the injuries are.

So far, they have no information about the suspect.

Police are also searching for the person who shot at a home near North 27th Street and Haskell Avenue about the same.

Officers say people were inside the home at the time of the shooting but no one was hurt. They also don't have any information about the shooter in this investigation.

They are asking anyone who saw anything suspicious to call the TIPS Hotline at 816-474-TIPS.
