
A man and a woman have been tied up and assaulted during an armed robbery of their east Belfast home.

Three men - one believed to be armed with a handgun - forced their way into the house on the Upper Newtownards Road just after 10.30pm on Sunday.

The couple were threatened, tied up and assaulted during the incident. They were later taken to hospital for their injuries, which police described as "not life-threatening".

A large quantity of jewellery was taken by the gang.

Naomi Long, Alliance East Belfast MP, said: "This was a shocking crime carried out by callous individuals. People should be able to feel safe in their own home without the threat of being assaulted.

"My thoughts are with this couple following what must have been a very traumatic experience for them. I hope they will be able to make a swift recovery from the injuries they sustained."

She added: "The people responsible obviously have no regards for the well-being of other people. If anybody has any information about this burglary then I would urge them to contact the Police."

Robin Newton, East Belfast DUP MLA, said that the armed robbery will shock the community.

"Once again thugs have carried out an armed robbery and have shown their willingness to terrorise their victims as they steal their jewellery.

"Incidents of this nature can so easily result in very serious outcomes and awful consequences," he said.

"The victims are defenceless when the gangsters strike. Not only can they suffer physical violence but in the after effects of the incident long-term mental health problems can result.

"The police need help from the public to put those who carry out these types of violent robberies behind bars."

Police have appealed for information.
