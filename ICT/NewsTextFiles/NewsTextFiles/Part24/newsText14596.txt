
One person was arrested and others are being questioned after a violent brawl erupted outside a northeast Houston nightclub, police say.

HPD says the fight started just after 1:45 a.m. outside a nightclub called Clayton's.

Lt. Larry Crowson says when officers arrived at the club on Greenspoint Drive and the North Sam Houston Parkway East, they saw "multiple victims and multiple suspects."

He says they saw gunshots fired in the air, two people run over by a car and one person beaten in the head with a tire iron.

Their injuries were not life-threatening, says Crowson.

It was unclear if she was the person police say they arrested for aggravated assault with a tire iron.

Investigators do not know exactly what caused the brawl, but say it appeared to be some sort of disagreement between multiple parties.
