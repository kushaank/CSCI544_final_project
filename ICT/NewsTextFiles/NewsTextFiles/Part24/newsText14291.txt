
A 47-year-old Buddhist monk allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself from a ceiling fan at his sister’s residence in South Delhi’s Vasant Kunj on Saturday.

The police are probing the circumstances that forced T.G. Rimpoche to take the extreme step, as the note he left behind is not very conclusive.

It is also learnt that Rimpoche was close to Tibetan religious leader Dalai Lama.

One of his relatives had lost an election recently, which had also upset him.

Rimpoche’s sister found him hanging on Saturday and raised an alarm. Two persons who reside with them, both Rimpoche’s followers, brought down the body and called up the police control room.

A police team soon reached the spot and rushed him to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared him dead on arrival.

Meanwhile, another team had cordoned off the house to conduct an investigation.

A hand-written suicide note in Tibetan was recovered from a diary kept on Rimpoche’s study table.

The source added that the translation of the letter disclosed that the monk was afraid that God would not forgive him for his sins and that he did not have the courage to face the wrath of the Almighty.

Another fact that cropped up during the investigation was that the deceased was depressed due to his health over the past year.

He was suffering from insomnia and was being treated for the same.

It was also discovered that Rimpoche was depressed and did not talk to anyone since May 16, when results of the general elections as well as the Arunachal Pradesh Assembly elections were declared.

Not ruling out other angles, a police officer said that the suicide note did not suggest any co-relation between Rimpoche’s suicide and the electoral loss of his relative.
