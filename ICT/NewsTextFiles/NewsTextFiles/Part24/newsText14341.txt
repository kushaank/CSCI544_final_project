ST. PAUL, Minn. - St. Paul Police are conducting a death investigation after the discovery of a body early Monday.

Department spokesperson Sgt. Paul Paulos tells KARE 11 that officers were called to the 800 block of 3rd Street East after the person was found. He says police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the death, but insists that it is not yet being called suspicious.

No suspects are in custody and those involved are said to be cooperating with police. Authorities are expected to release more details later Monday morning.
