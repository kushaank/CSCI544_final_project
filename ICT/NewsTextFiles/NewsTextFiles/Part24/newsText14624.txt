
A man accused of robbing a woman and kicking her in the head in a brutal attack during San Francisco's gay pride festivities has been sentenced to six years in prison.

Police say surveillance video of the June 30 attack shows 23-year-old Oakland resident Christopher Porter-Bailey kick the woman in the face while she is on the ground, seemingly for no reason. The 28-year-old woman had been robbed of her purse and cellphone.

The woman was knocked unconscious and suffered a concussion and other injuries.

San Francisco police said Wednesday that they have arrested an Oakland man in connection with a brutal assault on a woman at a citywide Pride weekend event called Pink Saturday. Christie Smith reports.

A jury convicted Porter-Bailey in February of robbery, assault and battery with serious injury. Prosecutors tell the San Francisco Chronicle a judge sentenced him on Friday to a six-year term.
