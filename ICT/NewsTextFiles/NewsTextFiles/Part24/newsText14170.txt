
Someone targeted the police department through Google.

Apparently at least one Google user isn’t too happy with the town’s lawmen.

“Forest what? Why would they put that up there,” Tulus Thompson said.

“Oh my,” Mike Dipple said.

“Forest PenisTown Clowns” is the first thing that pops up in the Google search, complete with a Google map of the accurate location of the police department and the correct phone number.

Attorney David Slane said this prank on the police department represents a larger problem.

“But it does point out the larger problem which is identity theft, how easy somebody could take over your Facebook or your Google search,” Slane said.

Some Forest Park residents said it’s no secret police keep a close eye on their 35 mile per hour streets.

Their guess is the culprit probably wasn’t too happy with a speeding ticket.

“Well there’s lots of people that don’t like the police department, that’s for sure, because that’s the only commerce here in town is speeding tickets,” Kenny Hoffman said.

The Forest Park police chief told us he wasn’t aware of the issue and he didn’t want to talk about it with us.

The city attorney and mayor did not return our calls.

We contacted Google and they said they encourage anyone to flag these kinds of problems by clicking on the feedback link.

They’ve already taken down the offensive post.
