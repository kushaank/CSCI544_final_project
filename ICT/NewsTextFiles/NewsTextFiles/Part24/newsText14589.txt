
Italian authorities have requested the extradition of a man from Venezuela who stands accused of breaching bail conditions given by the Trapani courts.

Diego Ruggeri, 38, today was arraigned before Magistrate Doreen Clarke. A European arrest warrant has been issued in his regard.

In February, Ruggeri was sentenced to four months in prison for falsifying documents and using them. He was released today, but the court ruled that he is kept in preventive custody.

Send him to Italy immediately. The Italians are our brothers.
