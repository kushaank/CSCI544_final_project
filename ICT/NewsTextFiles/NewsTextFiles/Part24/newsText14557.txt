
A Dallas woman says her drive home turned into the unthinkable recently when a naked man jumped through her sunroof and started beating her.

Witnesses say the suspect first attacked a woman jogging with her baby in an Oak Cliff neighborhood on Friday night, then saw a Honda at a stop sign and attacked again.

Marcus Payne, a nearby neighbor, began recording the incident with his iPhone.

In Payne’s video, police are seen pulling up just as the suspect, 23-year-old Nicholas Dyll, hurls himself into the sunroof of the car, which was being driven by a woman. Police are then seen trying to catch up to the car as it begins going the wrong way on Zang Boulevard.

“I couldn’t move; it’s like I was paralyzed with fear,” said the victim driving.

Once inside the car, the victim says Dyll punched her in the face and started choking her.

Out of instinct, the victim drove into a utility pole, stopped the car and allowed police to apprehend Dyll.

"It's like a nightmare every time I close my eyes,” said the victim.

The victim's car is now un-drivable, with damages estimated at more than $3,000, but the damage goes far beyond that.

"It’s so much more than a car,” said the victim. “Not being able to sleep, not being able to eat; it's too much."

Dallas police say Dyll looked like he was on drugs during the incident, but they don't know for sure yet. He was taken to Methodist Hospital for treatment, but so far hasn't been arrested because detectives are still investigating.

The first victims, a woman and her baby, are expected to be OK.
