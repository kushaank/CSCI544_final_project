
Deputies with the Trinity County Sheriff's Office have arrested a woman and are filing a warrant on a man following a drug arrest Friday afternoon in Trinity.

Teresa Carol Troquille, 38, is charged with first-degree delivery of a controlled substance.

According to the arrest report, a deputy pulled over a Ford Taurus, driven by Troquille, on the corner of Madison Street and Railroad Street in Trinity.

Troquille and her passenger, Todd Glick, were acting nervous and the deputy asked for consent to search the vehicle, according to the report.

The report states the deputy had the pair get out of the car and he had his K9 sniff the car. The K9 caught an odor of drugs and the deputy was able to gain cause to search the vehicle.

The deputy reported finding five grams of meth in a pocket of a backpack in the trunk.

The report states the pair were moving to Trinity Cove subdivison.

A warrant search showed Glick was wanted out of another county, so he was taken to that county and a warrant will be filed on him, according to the report.
