
An Emmonak man faces six assault charges after fleeing Alaska State Troopers and violently resisting arrest Friday evening, according to trooper dispatch.

When troopers responded to 23-year-old Justin Oktoyak’s home around 7:15 p.m. after a reported ax assault, AST said Oktoyak barricaded himself inside the residence then ran from troopers. When a trooper caught Oktoyak, according to AST dispatch, he struggled. Both he and the trooper received minor injuries.

An investigation revealed Oktoyak had damaged the family’s vehicle before the alleged attack with an ax, and was also wanted on an outstanding warrant from Anchorage. Court records show Oktoyak was convicted of a 2010 Anchorage drug charge, and a warrant was issued for his arrest after he failed to appear for a remand hearing at a local halfway house in March.

After his arrest in Emmonak Friday, troopers said Oktoyak was arraigned on six counts of third-degree assault and single counts of third-degree criminal mischief and resisting arrest.

His bail was set at $25,000.
