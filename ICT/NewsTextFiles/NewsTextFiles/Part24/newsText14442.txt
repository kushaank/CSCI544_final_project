GRAND RAPIDS, MI -- A man is in custody after shots were fired during an argument between two Grand Rapids residents, police say.

Police were called to the 800 block of Alexander Street SE about 1:10 p.m. Monday, May 19, on a report of shots fired. Police determined that an unoccupied vehicle was hit by gunfire, but no one was injured.

The shooting prompted police to close streets in the area while they searched homes, leading to one person being taken into custody. Roads have since been reopened to traffic.

Information about the suspect or the disagreement believed to have prompted the gunfire was not immediately available.

Lt. John Bylsma said police remain at the scene Monday afternoon while they collect evidence.
