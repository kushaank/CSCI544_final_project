
Amtrak suspends service at BWI for 'police activity'

Amtrak trains to Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport were halted for more than an hour Sunday night after police found a suspicious package at the station.

Maryland Transportation Authority police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Green said the package was "determined to be non-hazardous" and that police had responded "out of an abundance of caution."

Amtrak told passengers around 9:30 p.m. that all trains traveling both north and south would be delayed for about 30 minutes to an hour. Trains were moving by 10:37 p.m., the company said.

Craig Schultz, an Amtrak spokesman, said in an email that four trains carrying about 1,000 people were affected by the delay.

Passengers headed south on a train from Philadelphia said they were allowed to exit their train at the Halethorpe station, where it had stopped.
