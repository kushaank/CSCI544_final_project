A Nelson local who reported gunshots this afternoon had actually heard fireworks going off, police say.

One of Nelson's main streets, Tahunanui Dr, was cordoned off after the report prompted a mass police callout. As many as 22 units were sent to the area at around 1:40pm, along with members of the armed offenders squad.

"We cordoned the area off and made enquires and established it was actually fireworks," police spokesperson Barbara Dunn says.

"It is routine procedure when you've got calls about firearms or alleged firearm incidents to respond in a cautious manner."

All units have been stood down to return to normal duties and cordons have been lifted.
