
Liverpool defender Daniel Agger has voiced his frustration at failing to nail down a regular starting place under Brendan Rodgers this season.

While the club challenged for the Premier League title, the Denmark international was often overlooked for a starting spot in favour of Mamadou Sakho and Martin Skrtel, stating Rodgers did not feel he was "good enough".

Agger stopped short of confirming any plans to leave Anfield the summer but warned he would not be content to be a substitute next season.

Asked about being benched for the crucial late fixtures against Chelsea and Manchester City, he told Ekstra Bladet: "It definitely wasn't great. But I don't make the decisions. I think it is because the manager doesn't think that I'm good enough.

"[My future at Liverpool is] up to the manager. I can't go and put myself on the team sheet.

"I'm no-one's third choice."

Agger moved to Liverpool in 2006 from Brondby and has made 232 appearances during his time with the club - winning the FA Cup and the Capital One Cup.
