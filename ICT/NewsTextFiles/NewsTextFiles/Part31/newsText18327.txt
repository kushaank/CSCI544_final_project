Motherpipe Ltd. today announced the launch of a new search engine in India. Motherpipe provides an anonymous search alternative to Google and Bing for Indian internet users worried about online privacy.

A recent survey by Big Brother Watch found that Indian internet users worry more about their online privacy than those of any other country surveyed, with 94% saying they are concerned and 73% saying they are very concerned.

Motherpipe shows the same search results as Yahoo! and Bing and includes results from Twitter, but uses privacy technology to ensure that users are not tracked and search terms are not logged. This includes encrypting traffic between the user and the web site, disabling of web server logs and not using cookies.

“Profiling and targeting based on users’ browsing and search history is becoming the norm for internet advertising. It is clear that a lot of people in India are worried about this. India already has the world’s third largest internet population with enormous growth projected over the next few years. We are very excited to launch here and to be offering a service that addresses clear concerns about online privacy” said Motherpipe CEO Fred Cornell.

The new search engine is located at https://motherpipe.in .

Motherpipe is part of the Motherpipe Publisher Network providing over 12 million searches per month.

Motherpipe Ltd. was founded in 2013 and has offices in London, UK and Zermatt, Switzerland.
