BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (WIAT) — Twenty-year-old Mose Leonard is behind bars on unrelated charges after a Jefferson County judge saw the YouTube video Leonard posted about killing cops.

Leonard was in court May 15th, the day after he posted the video, for five charges of unlawful breaking and entering into a vehicle.

Judge Katrina Ross granted Leonard youthful offender status, but after she saw the controversial YouTube video he posted, she decided not to give him credit for time served.

The video references leaving  “police bleeding” and encourages other acts of violence against law enforcement.

Ross said she had previously warned Leonard about posting “crazy things” on social media.

Leonard will serve one month behind bars at the Jefferson County Jail.
