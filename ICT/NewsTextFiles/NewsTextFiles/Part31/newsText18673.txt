
Telecom operator, Vodafone Ghana has assured its customers that it is working expeditiously to fix the slight shortage of recharge cards in some parts of the country.

Commercial Director, Michael Nii Boye Adjei, and Chief Marketing Officer, Uche Ofodile visited some distributors and retailers in Accra and Koforidua to assess the situation and reassure them that it would ease up soon.

According to the Commercial Director, the shortage was due to some technical challenges on a system upgrade affecting pin number generation for recharge cards.

We encountered some technical challenges due to a system upgrade and were unable to generate enough pin numbers for the recharge cards; however, the problem has since been resolved and we are working around the clock to restore the distribution parity, he said.

He added that Vodafone Ghana remains committed to providing world-class service to its customers including distributors and retailers and apologised for the inconvenience emphasising the situation should normalise very soon.

Vodafone Ghana in the 2013/14 Financial Year embarked on a nationwide network expansion drive to improve network quality and customer experience. Additional cell sites were built and upgraded nationwide particularly in the Ashanti and Western regions.
