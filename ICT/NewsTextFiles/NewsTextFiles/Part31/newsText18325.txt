Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar Al Baker (pictured) said Europe’s growth is being “impeded” because its airports are not open 24 hours a day.

The gulf airlines chief said airports in Europe are failing to compete with the emerging hubs in Dubai and Doha, which are claiming an increasing slice of international passenger traffic.

He also said UK residents make “excessive” fuss about aircraft noise. “People in Qatar are not making as much fuss about noise as they are in Europe,” he said.

“If you live under a flight path of an airport, I assure you, over a period of time you will not even hear the aircraft passing over your house.

Referring to London, he said: “I know people require freedom but I think this is too excessive. Sometimes, the national interest must be considered.

If Akbar Al Baker is so keen to fly into UK at all hours, let him buy Manston Airport, just closed this month.

The population of Qatar is just over 2 million. That's similar to the numbers that are affected by high levels of aircraft noise arising from Heathrow's flights. Even in Qatar, things might appear differently if the entire population were affected by high levels of aircraft noise.

As it is, aircraft noise in Qatar primarily impacts open desert. Hands up, those who feel sorry for the camels!
