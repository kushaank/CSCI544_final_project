
London – A 15-man delegation from the British Royal College of Defence is set to carry out stability , peace and security  studies in Nigeria, an official of the court has said.

Leader of the delegation, Rear Admiral Jonas Haggren said this on Monday at a meeting with Dr Dalhatu Tafida Nigeria High Commissioner to the UK.

Haggren said that the studies were part of an annual research programme of the college to identify areas of challenge impeding development in many countries.

“Our mission is to carry out stability, prosperity and security studies in Nigeria, and also see how these challenges can be addressed from a regional perspective.

Haggren further said that the delegation would also visit Ghana and Cote d’ Ivoire on a similar mission.

Responding, Tafida said that the likely outcome of the study would further create awareness on “the true picture of Nigeria, not from a perceived or misconstrued point of view”.

While briefing the delegation on the government’s transformation agenda, he said that reforms in telecoms, agriculture and the services sectors have attracted increased Foreign Direct Investment.

According to him, the security challenges poised by the Boko Haram insurgency will not deter investment into the country as the problems are being tackled.
