
The Aboitiz Group is exploring opportunities overseas for power and food businesses, officials said Monday.

Aboitiz Equity Ventures president Erramon Aboitiz told reporters unit Aboitiz Power Corp. was looking at opportunities for geothermal and hydro power projects abroad, although there were no specific details yet.

“We are looking abroad. We looked at PNG [Papua New Guinea]. We are also looking at different opportunities in Indonesia. Right now, we don’t have anything firm,” Aboitiz said.

“We’re looking at buy-in or buying an operating asset or rehabilitation of asset rather than building from scratch,” he said.

“We’re looking at different sources. We are looking at geothermal, hydro,” he said.

Aboitiz said Aboitiz Power also planned to invest up to P80 billion in greenfield and brownfield projects across the country this year.

“This is just part of our ambitious plan to expand our power generation capacity by about 2,000 megawatts over the next five years,” he said.

The plan would double Aboitiz’s current power generation portfolio of 2,300 MW.

He said Aboitiz Power would diversify its power generation portfolio to include solar power projects.

“We are also vigorously looking at other opportunities in the renewable energy space. We hope to add solar energy projects into our RE portfolio to supplement our hydroelectric and geothermal projects,” Aboitiz said.
