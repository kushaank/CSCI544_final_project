
Home Secretary Theresa May, who faced intense scrutiny during her efforts to deport Abu Hamza, said she was pleased that that the cleric "has finally faced justice" after using "every opportunity, over many years, to frustrate and delay the extradition process".

"His conviction was facilitated by this government's tireless work to successfully remove him from the UK to face trial in October 2012," she added.
