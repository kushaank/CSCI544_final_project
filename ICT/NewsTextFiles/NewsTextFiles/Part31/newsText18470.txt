
Cadet Sergeant Major Taha Nazir.

Cadet Sergeant Major Taha Nazir, aged 17, has completed the most senior course an army cadet can take and now holds the status of being a Master Cadet.

He undertook the week long course at the Cadet Training Centre at Frimley Park in Surrey, during which he developed his skills in fieldcraft, leadership, weapon handling and drill.

He then demonstrated this expertise by delivering lessons in these areas to his fellow candidates.

The course was only open to an exclusive number of cadets and Sgt Maj Nazir is now eligible to be considered for further promotion to the rank of Cadet Regimental Sergeant Major, which would make him the most senior cadet within Lincolnshire.
