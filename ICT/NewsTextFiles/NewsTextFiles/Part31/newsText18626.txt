
I’VE never taken any leisure drugs. I never will — well, maybe to end some unbearable terminal disease, but otherwise, no.

But there are many people who do take drugs for pleasure, and there always will be. I don’t support the use of drugs, but the current laws and their enforcement haven’t fixed the problem, in fact, they may have made things worse.

The war on drugs has actually been a failure many ways with many unintended consequences and lots of collateral damage.

A couple of weeks ago an academic report was published by the London School of Economics, titled "Ending the Drug Wars", calling for a new approach. The report has been endorsed by no fewer than five economics Nobel Prize laureates, Britain’s deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, and George Shultz, former secretary of state of the US — quite some support!

The numbers aren’t the only things that matter, but they’re overwhelming. The market for drugs in the US is about $300bn. If that money had to be brought out of the shadows the Federal Reserve could stop its bond-buying programme!

Estimates vary considerably depending on what you’re counting but the one thing that’s consistent, is that they haven’t changed much over the last decade.

The US spends about $50bn a year on drug wars and it arrests about 1.5-million people a year for drug offences.

About 70,000 people have been killed in Mexico’s drug war and related deaths add a huge number to this. One major cause is a result of HIV passed on among addicts through dirty needles. Another is overdoses. Yet another is unclean cuts and mixtures.

It is self-evident that making drugs illegal has had its consequences, and the alternatives have to be debated.

Some parts of the world have taken the brave step of legalising drugs across the board, no exceptions. Such apparently off-the-wall strategies have often proven to be inspired, despite being counterintuitive. Europe has taken a far more "liberal" line than the rest of the world, in a field where attitudes vary in the extreme.

More than a decade ago Portugal decided to legalise — perhaps decriminalise is a better word — all drugs. It took the view that its citizens would be better off if they worked with the problem, rather than fought it. Their efforts and their budgets went into rehabilitation efforts, providing clean syringes and clean drugs, and compassionate treatment programmes.

Drug use is down generally, significantly, against the odds. As important is the fact that collateral damage has all but disappeared. As a population, the Portuguese are much better off.

At the other end of the spectrum we find countries such as Thailand, Russia and Iran where sentences for drug taking or dealing or possession range from labour camps to execution. If you saw Midnight Express, the 1978 movie based on the true story of an American student caught smuggling drugs out of Turkey, you’ve got the picture.

In the US the lawmakers also claim success. If you include marijuana, drug use is down by half since the 1970s — although the population is up and 120-million people in the US admit to using drugs, whether they get caught or not. But even the US is loosening the rules. Colorado led the way with legalising cannabis and has taken the lead again with the passing of the "Right to Try" law that allows terminally ill patients to try experimental drugs not yet approved by the authorities.

Somewhere in the middle we find the countries which have the laws but exercise a high degree of leniency in their application, particularly as they relate to dope smoking.

There can be no doubt that the use of addictive drugs for pleasure ("recreational use" — don’t you just love it?) is ultimately damaging to society and most often destroys, really destroys, the lives of many millions of young people. There can likewise be no doubt that governments need to do something about it.

But it is abundantly clear that it is not always the blunt and obvious action that solves the problem, that often solutions are counterintuitive, but clever, and that such solutions require leadership and unity of purpose to see through the obvious scepticism and criticism they inevitably face at first.

I think we should work with it, not fight it. You simply cannot criminalise a widespread social phenomenon. In rugby, the best way to tackle a man bigger than you, bearing down upon you with the intention of running through you and doing you grievous bodily harm, is to get him to fall with his own weight, to use his own momentum to bring him down.

The trouble with making illegal activities that enjoy widespread acceptance in society (like alcohol used to be in the days of prohibition) is that you force the activity underground, increasing the price and decreasing substantially the quality of people you have to deal with to get your fix. Manage it, don’t ban it.

If the punishment doesn’t match the crime then the worst elements of society prevail.

Of course, the application of leniency requires an even higher quality of leadership than simply applying force to apply the law.

That is, after all, the measure of our civilisation, the measure of our advancement as a human species.

Perhaps they should.

Or maybe they are flip sides of the same coin.

Perhaps you’ll always have one if you don’t have the other.

What has become common cause in even the leading first of the first world nations is that inequality will derail even the best laid plans. One of the principal flaws of capitalism over the past decade is that power is for sale (political power), and that the currency, regardless of its source, is that most widespread of votes, money.

If it is indeed true that money is a proxy for voting power, then some serious work needs to be done on its different sources.

Oligarchs controlling vast productive resources can hold governments to ransom and exert immense influence. Corrupt or otherwise ill-gotten gains cannot be allowed to buy the same number of votes, pro rata, as the hard-earned pay packets of nurses or teachers.

Let us move towards a world where knowledge and acquired acumen trump cash.

Money can still be a result, but it should remain only a medium of exchange — it can never be legal tender for power. We need to educate our people. Maybe a job should get you a vote, instead of a vote getting you a job? Well then, better you go get yourself a skill, better you go learn.

If you want to start a successful education programme you have to start as early as possible, long before school. Successful education is from the cradle to the grave.

Successful education starts at home. Successful education requires an enabling environment.

Successful education requires the right attitude from teachers and their pupils.

It starts with some really simple foundations. It is well known that a malnourished child cannot learn, and a sick child cannot concentrate. It goes back, in the first instance, to primary needs.

I met a lady at the literary festival in Franschhoek this weekend who owns a top hotel and who runs a daily muffin programme.

Local children are provided with "a muffin a day to keep the hunger away". The muffins are specifically made from ingredients which together are sufficient to cover a child’s very basic nutritional requirements. How clever is that?!

I’ve already spoken to Sue Huxter about how we should be taking her initiative national (hoping for a government grant to do so) and how we could extend it to the aged, many of whom suffer a similar plight. So, it is back to basics.

A brain needs food too, and a child with a full tummy has at least half a chance of turning her focus to other things — such as concentrating in the classroom, even if that classroom is the kitchen at home.

In business we have balance sheets to keep us in check. The assets, and the cash flows that they generate, determine the optimal funding mix and limit tolerances necessary to run a sustainable business. That’s how it should be, and businesses that don’t respect these boundaries eventually fail.

In education it should be no different. We need to match the education inputs with the demand for educated outputs.

In China they’re having to export excess graduates. We’re importing. In Hong Kong they don’t have enough international schools to educate the expatriate professional community. We need to serve our developing economy, which has requirements specific to our current circumstances and ambitions.

That probably means more technikons being built, that probably means more artisans than professionals. If we find that match between the skills being learned and the skills required in the real economy, we’ll create more jobs. That’s obvious. Of course, to know what skills to train we have to have a long-term plan of investment and growth. But we’ve got one, it’s called the National Development Plan.

In time there will have to be a specific strategy to attract talented people into government, as the employer of choice rather than the employer of default.

This would complete the virtuous circle of having the right economic plan actually implemented and it would, of necessity, start building those, oh, so necessary bridges between government and business.
