
TWEED Hospital has been identified as the biggest cause of parking rage in the shire.

Of the 35 people who responded to a Tweed Daily News social media poll asking the question: "The worst place for parking in the Tweed is ...", 16 people cited the facility.

There were calls for more parking to be provided at the emergency department in particular.

"Tweed Hospital emergency! The amount of times I've had really really sick babies and had to run from down the road in the rain or at night is ridiculous," said Rachel Wilson.

Mel Issa said: "Yep, Tweed Heads Hospital has the most shocking parking ever!"

Banora Point resident Ursula Donath suffered an accident at her workplace that caused knee and back damage.

Ms Donath said it made the parking shortage at the hospital particularly challenging.

"You park a mile away and then you have to walk all the way," she said.

"You drive round and round in circles trying to find a park. It's just crazy."

Limited parking at the facility has been cited as one of the reasons why a controversial paid car park is being considered, as reported by the Tweed Daily News in February.

But Ms Donath does not support this measure after experiencing the "expensive" parking at a Gold Coast facility. "It will be really disgusting to do that."

Other bad parking areas cited were schools and shopping centre car parks.

Rachel Lawrence said: "Tweed Hospital and Tweed River High; being a senior student there and trying to get a park in the morning was a joke!"
