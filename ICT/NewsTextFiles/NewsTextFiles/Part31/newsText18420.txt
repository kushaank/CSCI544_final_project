
A woman in Italy has had her Facebook account suspended after she posted a pro-LGBT rights picture of two women kissing.

Carlotta Trevisan, a 28-year-old mother, was told she had broken Facebook’s rules regarding “nudity and pornography” when she uploaded the image to mark International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia (IDAHOT) on Saturday.

She told the La Stampa newspaper how one user said it was “disgusting” and another complained that they “have young children to protect”.

Facebook contacted Ms Trevisan later that day, she said, to ask her to remove the image. When she refused, she was told her profile would be deleted for “violating the community’s standards”.

The stock image Ms Trevisan posted is widely used online to illustrate LGBT stories and issues, and she was left baffled and angry by all the fuss.

Last week a Rainbow Europe survey identified Italy as one of the worst 10 countries in the continent for LGBT rights, scoring just 25% compared to the UK's 82% Since the incident on Saturday evening, Ms Trevisan’s Facebook page appears to have been restored – after which she promptly posted the “offending” image as her profile picture.

Ms Trevisan told La Stampa the incident had been “sobering”, and she said she worried that younger women and girls might be subjected to a similar experience.

She said she thought most about her six-year-old daughter when she fought for her rights. “I’m thinking of her future,” Ms Trevisan said.

A spokesperson for Facebook told The Independent: “In an effort to quickly and efficiently process reports we receive, our community operations team reviews many reports every week, and as you might expect, occasionally, we make a mistake and block a piece of content we shouldn't have.
