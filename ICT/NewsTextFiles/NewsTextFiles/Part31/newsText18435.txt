
The trial of a suspect charged with shooting at two Birmingham police officers was scheduled to start on Monday, May 19, but it has been delayed.

It happened on I-20/59 North at the 22nd Street exit on November 30, 2012. Two police officers were part of Birmingham Mayor William Bell's security team and they were driving him home when bullets started flying near them.

Birmingham police say two suspects in a town car opened fire on an SUV near Bell's vehicle. The officers immediately jumped out of their vehicle and ran to where the suspects' vehicle had crashed.

The suspects and the officers ended up trading gunfire. Deandre Major was later charged in the shooting.

FOX6 did a little digging and found some court documents detailing Major's criminal history. Those documents show Major was released from prison several days before the incident.

Major's criminal history includes a guilty plea to impersonating an officer in 2006 and a guilty plea to burglary in 2007. Records also show Major pleaded guilty to robbery, possession of marijuana and illegally carrying a handgun in 2011.

The trial was supposed to start May 19 in Judge Virginia Vinson's courtroom. Late last week, prosecutors filed a motion to delay the trial.

The judge granted that request and set the new trial date for July 28.
