
The late Obeng held various political and public positions in Ghana and worked closely with many politicians from both sides of the divide.

Mr Obeng served in the Rawlings administration and was a senior advisor to the late President John Mills and continued in a similar role under current President, John Mahama.

A former Chief of Staff under the Rawlings administration, Nana Ato Dadzie on the Citi Breakfast Show on Monday stated that Ghana has lost a gem.

According to him, Mr. Obeng lived all his life in the public service and greatly contributed to the development of the nation.

“To think that he started as a private man, a private engineer and drifted into government…PV was a leader of the pack…he pulled all of us together, he developed ideas and moved the country forward,” he recalled.

He remarked that during the PNDC era, Mr. Obeng played a crucial role to move the country forward despite the challenges and hardships Ghanaians were experiencing.

Mr. Ndebugri, who worked in the late PV Obeng’s office during the PNDC era, noted that his former boss was a moderate politcian who always brought people together.

A leading member of the Convention People’s Party (CPP) and the Executive Director of Healthy Ghana, Professor Badu Akosa said although Mr. Obeng death came as a shock to him, it is not surprising for strong looking individuals to die unexpectedly.

Prof Akosa marveled at the brain capacity of the late Obeng and his phenomenal ability to remember happenings in Ghana in years past.
