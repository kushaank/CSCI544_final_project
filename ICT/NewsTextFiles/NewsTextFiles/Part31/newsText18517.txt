
A brand new facility is being constructed to better serve Limbaugh Toyota customers.

Limbaugh Toyota will soon begin construction of a new facility designed to better serve its growing customer base.  The new building, which will be located adjacent to the existing dealership, will include an expanded new car showroom, an expanded service center, and an updated customer lounge.

Limbaugh Toyota will remain open for business throughout the construction period.  Construction is scheduled to commence during June of 2014 and should be completed in the spring of 2015.

The project consists of an additional 40,000 square feet of space that will be used primarily by the new car and service departments.  Approximately five acres of additional land were secured on which to construct the new building.  The total cost of the new building and land is approximately $7 million.  Local companies Lathan Associates Architects and Johnson-Kreis Construction have been selected to design and construct the project.

The City of Birmingham provided Limbaugh Toyota with a package of incentives that recognizes the dealershipâ€™s contributions to the City.  The project also qualified for benefits through the State of Alabama New Market Tax Credit program.
