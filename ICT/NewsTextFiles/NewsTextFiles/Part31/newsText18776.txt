
The Ministry of Production (PRODUCE) ordered the suspension of anchovy catch in three areas of the national coastline for a period of five calendar days since last Saturday, as smaller size specimens appear.

After receiving the scientific recommendation of the Institute of Mar del Peru (IMARPE), the authority decided to safeguard the pelagic resource.

According to the Ministerial Resolution No. 145-2014 published in the Official Newspaper El Peruano, anchovy ban covers the area between 16°30' (Atico, in Arequipa) and 17°29' (Ilo, Moquegua) south latitude, within 20 nautical miles of the coast.

This measure should be accomplished by artisanal smaller and larger scale boats.

While the Ministerial Resolution No. 146-2014 established the suspension in the area between 11°30' and 11°59' south latitude (Chancay, Lima), between 10 and 30 nautical miles of the coast.

Besides, the ban on fishing anchovy is in effect in the area between 15°00' and 15°29' south latitude (north of San Juan de Marcona, in Ica), within 30 nautical miles of the coast.

This standard must be met by artisanal smaller and larger scale vessels -- as appropriate -- in the areas mentioned above.

Meanwhile, IMARPE scientists will be in charge of performing monitoring and tracking key biological, population and fishery indicators of anchovy and longnose anchovy and will have to inform and make timely recommendations to PRODUCE on the fisheries management measures.

Finally, the Ministry clarified that the breach of the provisions of the resolutions will be punished in accordance with the Consolidated Unique Text of the Rules of Fisheries and Aquaculture Inspections and Sanctions.
