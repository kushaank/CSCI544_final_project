BIRMINGHAM, Alabama -- The Birmingham Board of Education will meet tonight to ask Jefferson County for more local tax dollars , but it is also starting another process that could impact the system's future leadership.

Board President Randall Woodfin said today that when the board meets at 5:30 p.m. tonight in the board's downtown administration building, it will also conduct work session in which it will be instructed by and outside entity on how to evaluate Superintendent Craig Witherspoon as well as the board's performance.

The work session comes as students, parents and some lawmakers associated with Ramsay High School say they will push to remove the board and fire Witherspoon over the recent transfer of Ramsay High School Principal Evelyn Nettles .

Alabama Rep. Anthony Johnson, D-Birmingham, said Witherspoon's contract is up for renewal this year and that supporters of Nettles plan to remove the board and Witherspoon.

"We're going to take these petitions, we're going to clean out this school board and we're going to fire Witherspoon, in that order," said Johnson.

The board has maintained a unified front though, with Woodfin saying all of the board's decisions have sought only what is best for the education of Birmingham City Schools students.
