Staff shortage affects church service in Okla.

TULSA, Okla. — A Tulsa minister hasn’t been able to hold Sunday church services in the Tulsa County Jail for several weeks because of a staffing issue.

Minister Ronald Massey told FOX23 he’s been coming to the jail to preach for nearly 20 years and said that he’s never been turned away so often until recently.

“It’s been hits and misses throughout the past years, but I’ve never seen it this bad that we haven’t been able to come in and minister to the inmates,” Massey said.
