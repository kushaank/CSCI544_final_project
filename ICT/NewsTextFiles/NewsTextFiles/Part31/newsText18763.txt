May 19, Colombo: Sri Lanka has said that it is pleased that the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa lost her influence on the central India government with the landslide victory of the Bharathiya Janatha party (BJP) at the polls.

Sri Lanka's Media Minister and government spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella has said that the government is pleased that it could do business with the Narendra Modi-led central Indian government without Tamil Nadu exercising undue influence, PTI reported.

"A powerful government in Delhi is very good for us. Whatever the decision that the Centre takes, it will be without any undue influence from states like Tamil Nadu," Minister Rambukwella was quoted as saying.

"We are very happy that there is a very strong government and Prime Minister (-elect) Modi does not have to depend on any other party for his majority. This means even if Jayalalithaa had won 37 out of 39 seats in Tamil Nadu, she would not be in a position to influence the Centre," Rambukwella has said.

Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa was the first to congratulate the new Indian Prime Minister-elect extending an invitation to Mr. Modi to visit Sri Lanka at his convenience.

In response the PM-elect said he is looking forward to strong relations between the two countries.

Sri Lanka's relations with India soured following India's vote at the UN resolutions against the country in 2012 and 2013, largely due to the political pressure from Tamil Nadu. India abstained from voting on the third UN resolution on Sri Lanka this year.

The central Indian government's surrender to the pressure brought by the vehement anti-Rajapaksa sentiment of Tamil Nadu government has drawn Sri Lanka further into the folds of China, a consequence that has worried New Delhi as well as Washington.
