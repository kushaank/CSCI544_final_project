
THE City Government of Davao assured public school administrators that schools used as evacuation centers of fire victims will be restored soon.

Mayor Rodrigo Duterte said the City is responsible for restoring what has been damaged or lost from the time the evacuees occupied the evacuation centers.

"Kita nagbutang anang mga evacuees diha. Angay ra pud nga ang mayor ang musagot sa mga problema (We sheltered them there. It is the Mayor's responsibility to address the problems)," he said.

The city mayor apologized to the school management, especially to the teachers.

He said the City will finance everything for the repair of classrooms.

"Ipasuyop nako ang ga kasilyas, unya kadtong nangaguba ayuhon, unya ang kadtong nawala ilisan (Clean the comfort rooms, repair the damaged and replace what was lost)," he said.

"We will restore everything to its original conditions," he added.

The fire victims were temporarily billeted at Rizal Elementary School, Roxas Elementary School, Quezon Elementary School, Jose P. Garcia Elementary and Sta. Ana National High School (Sales Campus) after a massive fire engulfed their houses in Barangays 23-C, 22-C and 21-C.
