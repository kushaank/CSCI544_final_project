
"Duck Dynasty" Season 6 will have a very special guest for its premiere episode: Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal. A political appearance with the Robertson family will be written into the episode's storyline.

The fortuitous encounter and guest-starring role came when Jindal presented the Robertson family with the Governor's Award for Entrepreneurial Excellence in February. A&E cameras then reportedly caught the Governor and his family in footage for the show.

"It was really neat to have the governor on our show," Willie Robertson told the News-Star . "He did a great job and is used to cameras being around, so he was a natural."

For his part, Jindal seems to have been thrilled by being on the show. "My family and I had so much fun hanging out with the Robertsons and participating in the filming of 'Duck Dynasty' was a highlight," the Governor said, unfortunately unable to elaborate more because of a confidentiality agreement.

With speculation that Jindal might be considering a run for President in 2016, an association with the "Duck Dynasty" Robertsons could be a benefit -- the family is credited with helping a local politician gain office. Willie Robertson has also unofficially said that Jindal would be his Presidential pick.

"Duck Dynasty" Season 6 will premiere Wednesday, June 11 at 9 p.m. ET/PT on A&E.
