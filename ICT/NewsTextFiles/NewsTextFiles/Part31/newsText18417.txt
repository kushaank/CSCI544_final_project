
The British Government torpedoed Spain’s bid to host the 2020 Olympic Games as a reprisal for the Spanish Government’s hard line stance on Gibraltar, Sir Graham Watson has claimed.

The Liberal Democrat Member of the European Parliament made the statement during a debate on Gibraltar's Broadcasting Corporation, BC ahead of the EU election next Thursday. Sir Watson described how the British Government had drawn up a list of ways it could apply pressure on Spain to ease off at the border.

“Indeed I am told that PM Cameron actually said to the Spanish Prime Minister, ‘if you carry on with these border queues we will make sure you don’t get the Olympic Games’,” Sir Graham replied.

Spain’s Olympic Committee, the COE, faced tough questioning by executives from the International Olympics Committee during its final Madrid 2020 pitch to become host Olympic city. A British IOC official was among those who raised questions over doping issues which had tainted Spanish sport in recent years.

But later a spokesman for the British Government dismissed Sir Graham’s claim. ‘Sir Graham Watson was speaking as an MEP, not as a member of Her Majesty’s Government,” the spokesman said.

However putting in an unworkable claim for Gibraltar is apparently more important to Spain than the loss of the Olympics and them going legs up.

And if you keep nibbling and nibbling at Gibraltar, things are going to get worse and worse for Spain.

Actually Spain should thank us. They can't afford the Olympics. Just look at Brazil (which is actually in a far better financial state than Spain) and all the trouble it's causing there.

The rest of Europe should thank us too. If Spain had got the Olympics it would've been the EU footing the bill.

Confirming the move, the Ministry of Defence said that, while Gibraltar had sufficient assets to counter illegal Spanish incursions, it “continually monitored” the situation and reserved the right to “adjust” resources when needed.

Britain 'should consider scrapping F-35 stealth fighter'

A postponement perhaps.

If it did cost money theres no way of getting that money back now is there, so may as well make it worth any cost incurred. Queues it is.

@11 I don't think it is one country's vote that decide unless the rest of the votes were split evenly and the UK had the casting vote. However, it would be possible for the UK to have exerted pressure on other countries not to vote for Spain. Or maybe other countries just didn't approve of Spain's actions. More likely it was several countries thinking Spain was not in a position to host the olympics.

Did you read Blatter's statement on Swiss TV about the Qatar bid for the WCFs. He indicated that France and Germany had lobbied hard for Qatar because they have a lot of business contracts there. At least, they do now.

Whatever happened, real diplomacy and power wielding goes on behind the scenes.

@11  Perhaps you could look it up. Surely even a scotchman with the resources of the word-wide web at it's disposal could manage that!

It's on a straight majority vote (if I'm not mistaken), where if there isn't a venue with a majority of the votes the least popular is removed and the ballot rerun.

The UK only has one vote, the same as any other country, however there is likely to be a lot of overlap between the Olympic committees and the national Commonwealth Games committees for those countries that qualify, and so a judicious word in a friendly and sympathetic ear or two (or 52) might represent a serious dent in the competitivity of any Olympic bid.

10 - the aforementioned joy of messing with the people who forcefully took something from you. Sufficient for now.

Of course they could just acknowledge Spain has some moral right in this case and come to some agreement (like proposed by a GB prime minister), Im sure Spain would be reasonable, but if they want to live in a 2 km prison cell then thats their choice for now.

This world/European/Spanish recession has gone on for a while now.

The Euro was supposed to be long dead by now.

The EU was to have collapsed.

then all swings and roundabouts should be removed.

Spain is now closer to moving out of recession than when the financial crisis began.

Well I'm glad they are at least getting joy from Gibraltar.

she should have  no complaint about ours.
