
Hundreds of people were evacuated from the popular Stables Market in Camden, north London, after a large fire broke out on Monday evening.

Ten fire engines and 72 firefighters were deployed to the popular Camden market after the blaze broke out shortly after 8pm.

More than 600 people were evacuated from nearby restaurants, shops and supermarkets as the fire swept through the Stables Market, a popular tourist destination in north London.

Emergency services fought for more than three hours to contain the fire. Camden High Street was closed and traffic was diverted towards Kentish Town Road.

The London Fire Brigade confirmed there had been no casualties and an investigation has been launched to determine the cause of the fire, which is still unknown.

Photographs taken by eyewitnesses showed black smoke emerging from the market on Chalk Farm Road and a number of shops alight.

Fire Borough Commander Richard Welch said: "When firefighters arrived they were faced with a fire in a range of shops under railway arches and the smoke could be seen from miles around."

The Stables Market is a popular tourist attraction in London visited by more than 40 million people, according to its website, and is known for its food, jewellery and clothing stalls.
