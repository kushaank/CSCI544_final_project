
A Ukip candidate who sent a letter to his constituents calling for pro-Europe leaders to be hanged has apologised, saying he has not had media training.

Gordon Ferguson, who is standing in the Cambridge ward in Southport, said in an email to the Guardian: "In retrospect I can see the language I used and ideas I alluded to may be perceived as rather strong. However, it's a reflection of how strongly I feel about the growing undemocratic power and influence of the EU over UK affairs. I am by no means media trained but an ordinary chap who wants the best for Britain."

He said the media were looking for any way to embarrass the party by going after "ordinary men and women who wish to stand proudly for Ukip at local level". He said he "regretted any embarrassment he had caused the party at this crucial time".

In the letter to constituents, Ferguson wrote: "The Lib-Lab-Cons have conspired with a foreign power the EU and all are thereby guilty of treason. They have sold Britain with the world's fifth largest economy illegally into increasing slavery inside the EU dictatorship. Those responsible should be brought to trial and those found guilty of treason should be hung by the neck until dead (Blair illegally changed the penalty to save his neck)."

He went on to claim it was unlikely that treasonable acts by politicians would be brought trial because most police officers, judges and the Crown Prosecution Service were "almost all exclusively freemason", adding: "Britain's courts have been corrupt for many years. They are all almost in the pocket of the EU."

Ferguson has appeared in a YouTube video denouncing opponents of Ukip for pulling down posters and throwing paint over a Ukip van.
