
A performance by Katy Perry is among the launch gigs for LoveLive TV.

British music startup LoveLive has launched a connected-TV app to stream video of concerts by artists including Katy Perry, Disclosure, Kendrick Lamar and Ellie Goulding.

The LoveLive TV app, which for now is only available on LG's range of connected TVs, will stream a mixture of full-length gigs, festival interviews and sessions, and backstage footage from participating artists.

Some concerts will be streamed live later in 2014. LoveLive is also planning to sell ads and sponsorships within the app, while also launching it on the devices of other connected-TV manufacturers.

"For us, it's the culmination of our ambition to create the ultimate home viewing experience for live music," LoveLive chief executive Richard Cohen told The Guardian.

"We're placing live music in the centre of people's living rooms, on the biggest screen in the house. It's never going to replace going to a gig, but for us it's the next best way to capture the thrill and excitement of that live experience."

Cohen said that LoveLive is now filming around 500 live performances a year, which are distributed through the company's YouTube channel , the new TV app, and the "L-Platform" service it launched earlier in 2014 , which embeds concerts on partner sites including The Guardian, Time Out and Q.

"L-Player will go into Xbox, Roku, Apple TV, and possibly even Netflix or LoveFilm. There's such a demand for this stuff," said Cohen. "Ultimately, the app will be regularly updated with the new content from our catalogue, as well as stuff from our label partners."

LoveLive TV is the brand for the company's TV app and its YouTube channel alike, with the latter having signed up more than 147,000 subscribers and generated 14.9m video views since its launch in 2012. LoveLive also runs the Transmitter YouTube channel launched by music industry body the BPI last October.

Cohen said LoveLive is also about to kick off its first round of institutional funding, seeking between $20m and $25m to continue expanding its business.

"Our ambition is to establish the world-leading marketplace for premium live-music video online," said Cohen. "Think what Getty Images have managed to do globally for stills."
