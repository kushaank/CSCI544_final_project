
Ed Miliband has announced that if Labour were to win the general election they will take “radical action” against low pay by setting a statutory minimum wage target linked with average earnings.

Mr Miliband said the current system is a “scandal” as millions of people are “unable to make ends meet” despite being in employment.

Although he has not announced what the exact figure is, a Labour source said it would be a “stretching target”.

Both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have also announced that the minimum wage would be increased if they were to be elected.

Whilst the minimum wage will already increase by 19p to £6.50 an hour in October, Chancellor George Osborne has proposed a further increase, taking it to £7 an hour.

Additionally, Vince Cable, Business Secretary for the Liberal Democrats has proposed setting a “long-term target”, although he did fall short of stating any specific figures.
