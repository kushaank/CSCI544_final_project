
LONDON, May 19 (Reuters) - The head of Murphy's Oil UK operations has stepped aside to pursue the acquisition of the company's ailing Milford Haven refinery and retail business, a source close to the company said on Monday.

Murco, Murphy's British subsidiary, has been engaged for months in talks with several parties on the sale of the 135,000 barrels-per-day refinery and its assets.

Murco Managing Director Tom McKinlay told employees on Friday he was taking a leave of absence. Brian Kelly, currently head of Murphy's business development in West Africa, the Middle East and Britain, will replace him and lead Murco's negotiations with the potential buyers, the source said.

"Tom McKinlay has taken a leave of absence because he is pursuing a management buyout in order to maintain integrity of process," the source said.

A Murco spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment.
