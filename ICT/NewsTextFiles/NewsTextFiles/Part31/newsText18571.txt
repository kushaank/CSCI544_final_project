
Abu Hamza, the radical Muslim cleric, has been found guilty of supporting terrorism by a New York court.

He was accused of conspiring to aid organisations like al-Qaeda.

Abu Hamza, who was extradited from the UK in 2012 after an eight-year legal battle, denied all the charges. He now faces a possible life sentence.
