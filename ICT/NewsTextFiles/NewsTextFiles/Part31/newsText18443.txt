
BELFAST, May 19 (RIA Novosti), Mark Hirst – Gerry Adams, the President of Sinn Fein – the political party affiliated to the IRA - is to travel to Washington DC next week to hold talks with the US Department of State and other political leaders over fears the Anglo-Irish peace process is slipping into crisis.

In a statement Adams, who is a member of the Irish Parliament, Dáil Éireann, blamed the British Government for failing to progress the peace-agreement, known as the Good Friday Agreement, which brought an end to the 35 year conflict.

“The peace process is facing some turbulence at this time as a result of the failure of the British government to deal with outstanding issues arising from the Good Friday Agreement,” Adams said.

Adams accused the British Government of refusing to back compromise proposals drawn up by US diplomat Dr Richard Haass to deal with so-called “legacy cases” arising from the conflict which claimed over 3,500 lives.

“The negative stance of the British government is also encouraging the Unionist parties not to engage fully in the political process and institutions,” Adams added.

"My visit to Washington next week is to highlight these issues and concerns and to seek a renewed focus and support for the peace process and the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement,” Adams added.
