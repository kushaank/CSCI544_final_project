
TOKYO— A popular manga comic is setting off a public debate in Japan about the health effects of radiation following the Fukushima nuclear disaster — so much so the publisher issued a special edition Monday.

The April 28 issue of “Oishinbo,” by Tetsu Kariya, depicted a character getting a nosebleed after visiting Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant. Three of its reactors sank into meltdowns after the March 2011 tsunami, and radiation contaminates nearby towns.

Local governments say the manga comic’s portrayal fosters unfounded fears, even discrimination against Fukushima.

Big Comic Spirits magazine added a special section in its Monday’s issue with criticism and input it had received on “Oishinbo,” including views from medical experts.
