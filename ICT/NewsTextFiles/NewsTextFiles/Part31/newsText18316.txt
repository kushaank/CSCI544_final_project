
A GRANDMOTHER dubbed “Shirley Valentine on benefits” is demanding the right to return to Britain with her Tunisian toyboy husband.

Deborah Chniti, 43, attacked the Home Office for refusing her permission to bring 27-year-old North African labourer Ala Chniti here.

She gave up a life on disability allowance in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs, after she met Ala on Facebook and moved to Tunisia.

But the mother-of-three claims she is now stranded there and penniless because she cannot work and her husband only earns £5 a day.

Her plan to bring him home was torpedoed by new rules which say people must have £62,000 savings or a salary of £18,000 before a foreign spouse can be granted a visa.

“I need to go home,” she said yesterday. “I want to be with my children and grandchildren but I can’t leave my husband. I’m an emotional wreck.

"No one speaks English where we live. I’m stuck in the house all day.

“I can’t go to the shops because they don’t understand me. They don’t speak English and that’s the only ­language I speak.

“People stare at me because I don’t dress like them and women knock into me. It’s unfair to be apart when we’ve lived together two years.

Mrs Chniti left three children and four grandchildren behind in Britain in June 2012 after a whirlwind romance.

She believed she could return with her husband after four years and he would not need a visa.

But the rules changed the year she left the UK.

New financial requirements were brought in to discourage migrants from marrying Britons and sponging off the state.

Mrs Chniti said: “I can’t work, I have a bad back. I also have asthma and depression.
