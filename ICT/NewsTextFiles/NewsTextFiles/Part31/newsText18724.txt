An enthusiastic group of 60 people packed the council chambers this week for a workshop on Effective Marketing on a Shoestring Budget.

Workshop facilitator Karyn Taylor, a local marketing consultant, said the free workshop looked at how business owners could improve their marketing in cost-effective ways.

She said technology is changing all the time, particularly in terms of social media.

Brendan McHugh has a development application before council to start a business in Bathurst.

He wants to open a pet hotel for all pets, not just cats and dogs.

Mr McHugh attended council’s free social media workshop. He added that he is also taking part in council-sponsored evening classes in Micro Business Operations which will run for three months.

“Council really is investing in the success of small business,” Mr McHugh said.

Gavin Baker has just started his own small business Insulate Double Glazing on the Sydney Road. He has been in operation for the past six months.

“This workshop was perfect for me because of the stage I’m at, trying to grow awareness and target audiences,” he said.
