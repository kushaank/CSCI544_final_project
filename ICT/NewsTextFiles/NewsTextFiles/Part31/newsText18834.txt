Cushing worked with Joseph and Rose Kennedy to support the cause of mentally handicapped children, and his friendship with John F. Kennedy made him a prominent presence in the Kennedys' life.

Cushing officiated at John F. Kennedy's marriage to Jacqueline Bouvier on September 12, 1953 at St. Mary's Church in Newport, Rhode Island. He also supported Kennedy's presidential campaign in 1960.

When Kennedy was elected the first Roman Catholic president, Cushing delivered a prayer at his inauguration.

Still later, when an assassin's bullet struck Kennedy, Cushing presided over the slain president's funeral.

In a 1966 oral history interview for the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, Cushing said he was "bewildered and shocked" when he had heard the tragic news about the president's death.

"It was a very, very simple funeral, following as close as possible the services in memory of the martyred Lincoln. No fanfare, everyone bowed in sorrow, tears flowed in abundance," said Cardinal Cushing, now deceased, in the interview.

"On the way out, I was preceding the casket, and I went over to Jacqueline and shook hands with her. I kissed little Caroline and shook hands with her. John John was getting a little restless, so he was down in the rear of the church. Outside at the end of Mass, John John saluted the flag, the most touching thing I ever saw."
