Relatives of Scotland's told the newspaper that they thank the public for their concern but asked for prayers and privacy. Scotland’s name was first reported by WBZ-TV .

Meanwhile, Massachusetts elevator inspectors were at the ballpark over the weekend trying to figure out how Scotland fell down the elevator shaft - if both doors opened or only one, or if the bottom gave way.

Scotland's Facebook profile says that she was originally from Brigantine, but now lives in Boston.
