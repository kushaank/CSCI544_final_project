
A new direct flight service to the capital of Qatar will contribute £86m to Scotland’s economy over the next three years, VisitScotland has said.

The tourism quango said the Qatar Airways connection to Doha, which will run flights from Edinburgh Airport five days a week from 28 May, will bring in £33m in the first year alone through ‘business tourism’.

It is one of six new direct routes launching at Glasgow and Edinburgh airports later this month, connecting Scotland to Philadelphia, Chicago, Zurich, Verona, and the Dominican Republic.

The flights are being highlighted at the IMEX international tourism trade show in Frankfurt this week, where a VisitScotland delegation hopes to attract more international visitors and businesses to Scotland.

Neil Brownlee, head of business tourism at VisitScotland, told journalists: “Scotland is excelling in business tourism, evidenced by the wealth of major investments happening throughout the country including accommodation, venues and major new flight routes.

“We are looking forward to communicating the importance of doing business in Scotland to over 9,000 buyers at the event.

“With the Commonwealth Games, Ryder Cup and over 800 Homecoming events, 2014 is set to be a massive year for Scotland and this delivers great opportunities for not only business tourism, but for the whole of the Scottish economy.
