
Barisan Nasional (BN) candidate for the Teluk Intan parliamentary constituency Datuk Mah Siew Keong accepts that winning the Teluk Intan parliamentary by-election will be a daunting task.

However, in light of voters preference for a local over an outsider, he is confident of wresting the seat that he had held for two terms after winning in the 1999 and 2004 general elections.

Mah, who lost the seat in the 2008 and 2013 general elections, rated his chance of regaining it as 50:50.

The BN must show true grit to convince voters why it should be given the task of representing them, instead of the DAP, he told reporters at the close of the nomination of the Teluk Intan parliamentary by-election at SMK Seri Perak today.

Mah, 53, who is also Gerakan president, faces DAP's Dyana Sofya Mohd Daud, 27, in a straight fight in the by-election set for May 31.

Mah said at first, Gerakan wanted to field a newcomer in Teluk Intan, but eventually the party's leadership felt that he should vie for the seat as he was the party president and a local.

"The prime minister told me to go for it following a discussion. I have decided to join in the fray whatever the outcome may be.

"And I do not shirk my responsibility despite our wish of giving the opportunity to a new face," he said.

He hoped that everyone would steer clear of personal attacks, hurling abusive words, distorting facts, and playing with people's emotions as they were not the culture of Teluk Intan. â€“ Bernama, May 19, 2014.
