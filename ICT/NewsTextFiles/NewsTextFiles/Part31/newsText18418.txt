
LIVE FROM OPEN MOBILE SUMMIT, LONDON: Time is of the essence in efforts for Europe to tap into its technology potential, including the creation of a single telecoms market, according to Carlota Reyners Fontana (pictured), member of the cabinet of vice president Neelie Kroes.

Fontana outlined how the increase in internet traffic is taking place as revenue for the European economy declines, showing that businesses are not exploiting opportunities.

One of the main areas that Kroes and her team are looking to address is the relative lack of 4G coverage, which Fontana said “still represents a too small share” and a lack of penetration in rural areas.
