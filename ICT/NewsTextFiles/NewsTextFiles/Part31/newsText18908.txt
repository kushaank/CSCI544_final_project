
The government aims to provide, at the very least, public work to all working-age citizens of Hungary, State Secretary János Lázár said on Monday (May 19) at Csanádalbert. He particularly emphasized the importance of ensuring jobs and opportunities for citizens living in smaller cities and villages.

According to Lázár, who runs the Prime Minister’s Office, the latest EU funds make it possible to support SMEs engaged in industrial activities in smaller settlements. Infrastructure and public transport should also be developed to help citizens reach their workplaces.

The Hungarian government wants to change a scenario where 75% of land-based grants and rural development grants are taken by 10% of tender applicants. The unification of grant distribution is expected to create more jobs and reduce the unemployment rate in agriculture.

Lázár said that the transformation of local government systems is now considered complete, although local representative bodies must be involved. The government would help fund this, though the role of municipalities is also expected to grow.
