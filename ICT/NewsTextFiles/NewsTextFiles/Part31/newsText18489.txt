
CANNES, France (AP) â€” Famed British artist Damien Hirst has created a gilded woolly mammoth skeleton encased in a gold tank to be auctioned off at the annual amfAR Cinema Against AIDS gala this week.

Titled "Gone but not Forgotten," the three-meter mammal joins Hirst's famous shark in formaldehyde and bisected cow in his "Natural History" series.

The one-of-a kind piece is expected to raise millions of dollars for the charity's work in the fight against AIDS. Past auction items have included a trip to space with Leonardo DiCaprio and a kiss from George Clooney.
