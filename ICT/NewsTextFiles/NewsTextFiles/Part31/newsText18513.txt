
AstraZeneca chairman Leif Johansson: Pfizer bid 'too low'

UK drugs company AstraZeneca has rejected an improved "final" takeover offer from US drugs giant Pfizer.

AstraZeneca chairman Leif Johansson told the Today programme that the bid was rejected as the offer was "too low", the way it was set up was disruptive, and there would be "a long outdrawn procedure" before the takeover could be finalised.
