
BELGRADE --  Minor charges have been filed against 83 stores that decided to sell food and other items at significantly higher prices after the floods hit Serbia.

Deputy PM and Minister of Trade Rasim Ljajić explained late on Saturday that most of these stores are located in Belgrade and the municipalities that have not been affected by the disaster, and that inspectors ordered one such store to be closed.

In case of "serious abuses," the minister announced, criminal charges will also be brought.

Ljajić urged citizens to report such cases to local crisis HQ and local and regional inspectorates, and noted that those found guilty of the illegal practice will face fines of RSD 2 million and have their stores shut down for a period of six months to two years.
