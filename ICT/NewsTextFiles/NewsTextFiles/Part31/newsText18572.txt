
The search for four British sailors missing in the Atlantic has resumed after it was called off on Sunday.

Their boat got into difficulties in bad weather 620 miles east of Cape Cod in Massachusetts on Thursday, as it returned to the UK from a regatta in the Caribbean.

The sailors' families have said the men would have escaped in a life raft.

Alistair Hackett, from life raft suppliers Ocean Safety, explained to the BBC's Nick Higham how people survive inside a life raft, similar to one that would have been onboard the missing yacht.
