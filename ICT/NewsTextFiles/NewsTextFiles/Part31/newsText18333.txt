
The  award winning Zimpraise gospel outfit is currently  in the UK for a second tour and they  gave their loyal fans a scintillating performance at  the Watford Colossium on Saturday.

This is the second time that they are coming to UK and they did not disappoint .Zimpraise are being supported by the legendary Mechanic Manyeruke  who took his fans into yester year  with a polished and energetic  performance.

The hugely talented Sharon Manyonganise  gets better and better  and there seems  to be no limit to what  she can do on stage. When she does their flagship Sungano trademark  song , she looks like she is really singing from the heavenly realm.

The Watford Collossium performance proved that quality gospel music remains popular and that Zimpraise are the undoubted leading gospel outfit .

Manyeruke and Zimpraise may look like two groups from different eras but their performance backed by a competent band of musicians proved that quality is quality  no matter  what time it comes from “I really wanted to give my fans a treat before I proceed to  Canada next month” said the ever  smiling Manyeruke.

Wellington Kwenda and Manyeruke  are going to Canada after the UK for a further performance there.

Mr Joseph Madziyere the CEO and choir conductor said they would always treasure the support of their UK fans and each time they are in the country and will push to give their last ounce of energy to make their fans enjoy inspired Worship and Praise. “After all,it`s all about Jesus” he said.

Their next call is at the Maher centre in Leicester on  May 24. This show has been moved to start at six pm to allow those at work not to miss the show .
