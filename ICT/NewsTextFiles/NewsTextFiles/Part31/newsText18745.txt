
A YOUTH group, Urhobo Youth Leaders Association, has condemned the abduction of more than 200 school girls from Government Secondary School, Chibok, Borno State by Boko Haram insurgents over a month ago.

The group in a statement by its President, Comrade Francis Arhiyor, described the act as unreligious and barbaric, and called on the sect members to release the girls unconditionally.
