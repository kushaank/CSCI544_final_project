
Mr Cameron described his visit as “fascinating”.

He said: “I’m obviously very keen to support [Harlow MP] Robert [Halfon] and the work that he is doing locally, and he’s pushed really hard to get this University Technical College here.

“The building is going ahead well and it’s going to open this September. It’s got a full state of students coming and I think it will be a major addition to Harlow’s educational landscape and a really positive one for young people, parents and local employers.
