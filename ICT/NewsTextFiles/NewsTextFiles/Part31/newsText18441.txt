Supporters of Scottish independence are losing ground in their battle to breakaway from the United Kingdom, if a new opinion poll is to be believed.

The SNP, led by Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond, argues that independence would let oil-rich Scotland decide its own path rather than having often unpopular policies imposed from London.

But in the new survey, by ICM, just 34 per cent of people backed independence – that is 5 percentage points down on its previous poll a month ago and the lowest level since last September.

The same survey put the anti-independence campaign at 46 per cent – an increase of four percentage points compared to last month.

British Prime Minister David Cameron has urged Scots to stay in the UK when they vote in a referendum on September 18.
