
The governor of the Bank of England has castigated a mortgage assistance scheme similar to one being proposed by the  Government.

Britainâ€™s Help to Buy scheme,  launched in April 2013, should be curbed as it may be encouraging a return to risky home loans,  Mark Carney warned.

While the Irish scheme is restricted to first-time buyers and average-sized homes, the broad parameters are the same, and pose the same difficulties, experts here warn.

The Irish scheme will allow first-time buyers to buy  houses with smaller deposits, by giving out mortgages worth up to 95% of the value of the home.

Mr Lyons said the scheme is the wrong answer to the paucity of affordable homes.
