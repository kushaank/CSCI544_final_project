
Shropshire Council is turning to Europe in an effort to get almost £24 million to help roll out high-speed broadband across the county, it was revealed today.

The Government project Broadband Delivery UK has already offered the authority £11.38 million for the task - but only if it can match the funding by the end of June.

Patrick Cosgrove, spokesman for the Shropshire and Marches Campaign for Better Broadband pressure group voiced fears earlier this month, however, that the council could lose the cash as talks with Broadband Delivery UK had "hit a brick wall".

Former Labour MP Jeff Rooker sought clarification on the situation in the House of Lords last Tuesday.

Baron Rooker of Perry Barr, as he now is, told the House: "There were reports last weekend in some rural areas, I cite Shropshire, of Tory-led councils saying that they were not prepared to put in their £11 million of match funding.

"It will be disastrous for rural areas if local authorities cannot match the funding that is required."

Lord Rooker has since received a written update from the House's spokesman for Culture, Media and Sport, Lord Gardiner of Kimble, which confirmed Shropshire Council had expressed an interest in taking up the offer of the £11.38 million.

Lord Kimble said in a letter to Lord Rooker that the council had not yet been able to say it could match the funding and added: "Broadband Delivery UK is, however, in discussion with Shropshire County Council about potential options for matching the Government allocations, including exploring the possibility of using European funding sources."
