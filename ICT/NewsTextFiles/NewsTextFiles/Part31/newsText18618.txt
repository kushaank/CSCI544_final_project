
WAKEFIELD, Mass. & MAIDENHEAD, United Kingdom--( BUSINESS WIRE )--       Today, SDL (LSE: SDL) announces the next release of SDL        Web , the Web pillar of the Customer        Experience Cloud (CXC) . An industry first, SDL CXC now offers        context brokering, which enables businesses to provide personal and        contextualized interactive brand experiences for customers across all        channels and devices throughout their individual customer journeys.

With its unique real-time context brokering technology – capturing        insights from all sources and then utilizing the data to tailor online        experiences for both known and anonymous visitors – SDL is the first to        close the context gap in customer experience. SDL Web equips marketers        with the technology needed to create continuous, automatic interaction        cycles that meet customers’ engagement expectations, replacing        ineffective and sporadic campaign approaches.

“At KONE we strive to be first in customer loyalty and to deliver        outstanding customer experiences at every touch point. SDL’s technology        is a crucial component in making this happen in an online world and we        see SDL’s solution strategy enabling the delivery of engaging,        contextually relevant online experiences and it offers tremendous        opportunities for us,” says Kari Leppänen, owner, online marketing and        communication solutions, KONE.

Now, marketers are able to capture and apply data-driven insights, which        are generated when consumers visit a brand’s Web and mobile sites. As        noted in a recent SDL        global study of millennials , consumers are willing to provide brands        more personal information if they use it to customize their        interactions. With SDL Web, brands can broker a wide array of contextual        information to offer consumers immediate and actionable options and        relevant offerings depending on the device used, time of day, language,        browsing history and various other contexts, to always deliver an        optimized customer experience, arming marketers with the ability to        create brand advocates.

SDL Web is a key part of SDL Customer Experience Cloud and is made up of        a series of solutions that include SDL Tridion, SDL Mobile, SDL        SmartTarget, SDL Media Manager, SDL Safeguard and SDL Customer Analytics        that enables marketers to address everything needed to build an engaging        contextually relevant online presence. To further support these        endeavors, SDL has delivered numerous context-centric enhancements to        SDL Web including hyper-relevancy, advanced integrations and extended        cloud deployment. It is available for customers and partners who deploy        SDL on premise, through a hybrid model or in the cloud to provide the        ideal mix of business agility, integration options and scalability, for        any company’s current and future requirements.
