LONDON (AP) â€” The families of four missing British yachtsmen pleaded Monday for the U.S. Coast Guard to resume searching for the men, whose boat disappeared last week in the mid-Atlantic.

The high-performance Cheeki Rafiki yacht was returning from a regatta in Antigua when it ran into trouble Thursday about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) east of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The 40-foot-long (12-meter-long) Beneteau yacht diverted to the Azores before contact was lost Friday.

U.S. Coast Guard and Canadian aircraft, assisted by three merchant vessels, spent more than two days scouring the ocean for captain Andrew Bridge, 22, and crew members James Male, 23, Steve Warren, 52, and Paul Goslin, 56. The search was stopped Sunday amid treacherous weather.

Male's father, Graham, said the men could be adrift in a life raft. He said the families have asked the British government to lobby U.S. and Canadian authorities "to reinstate the search."

The cargo vessel Maersk Kure spotted an overturned hull Saturday that matched the description of the missing yacht, but saw no life raft or any signs of survivors.
