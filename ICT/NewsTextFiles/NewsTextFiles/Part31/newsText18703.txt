
The President of the Republic of Ghana and Chairman of Authority of ECOWAS Heads of State and Government, President John Dramani Mahama,  has warned that the activities of the terrorist sect, Boko Haram pose  a threat to the stabilisation of the ECOWAS sub-region, and not just to Nigeria.

He therefore called for greater co-operation among member states to work with Nigeria and the international community to defeat the sect.

Mahama said these while speaking at the opening of the 2014 First Ordinary Session of the Third Legislature of the ECOWAS Parliament in Abuja Monday.

Mahama, represented by the Vice President of Ghana, Dr. Kwesi Attah also condemned the abduction of over 200 school girls in Chibok, Borno state,  adding that it was unfortunate that the sect has unleashed terror on Nigerians and instilled fear in the hearts of the citizens.
