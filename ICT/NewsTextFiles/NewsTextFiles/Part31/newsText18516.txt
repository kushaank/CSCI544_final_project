
Despite the fact that Sony has set out its plans to expand its Amazing Spider-Man franchise with the sequels The Amazing Spider-Man 3 and The Amazing Spider-Man 4, as well as spin-offs for Venom and The Sinister Six, so far leading man Andrew Garfield been reluctant to commit himself beyond the third movie of the rebooted series.

However, if – and given the source, this is a huge if – the British tabloid The Daily Star is to be believed, Sony may have just reached a deal with Garfield which will see him remaining in the role of Spidey through to 2020. Presumably, this would include the at least one of the aforementioned spin-offs alongside the third and fourth Spider-Man movies (which are set for 2016 and 2018), leaving the studio enough time to shoehorn in a fifth in 2020, despite the fact that Garfield will be 36 by that time.

I don’t care if he stay as Spider-Man until he is 50. As far as I’m concerned he is Spider-Man. He is brilliant in the role. This is coming from a Spider-Man comic book fan my whole life so I know what I mean.

I can not get enough of his wit as spidey. Keep him as long as possible.

Actually the fourth film has been delayed from the 2018 slot and the slot will now be filled with one of the spin-offs although they haven’t decided which yet. It is also worthwhile pointing out that the article mentions (much like he has already confirmed) that the third film was already under his existing contract (which was for three films), although they say here he is currently signed on for another film in 2015 on top of these additional four, despite the fact Sony don’t have a movie lined up for 2015.

Needless to say, we all know what that 2015 film probably will be, and it is that fact that makes the whole story questionable.

Guess I won’t be seeing Spiderman movies for a while then. The new iteration is soulless drivel.
