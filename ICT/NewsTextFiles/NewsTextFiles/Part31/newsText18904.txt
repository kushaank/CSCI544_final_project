
New Delhi: With BJP winning in the Lok Sabha Elections with 283 seats, the party headed by the PM to be Narendra Modi will hold number of meetings on Monday so as to decided on the names who will be part of NaMo's cabinet.

As of now, there are just reports of some names, who will get top posts in the government, however, Modi and team are still disusing on the same and will continue doing it until the meeting of the BJP's lawmakers that will be held on Tuesday. In this meeting, the 282 members of the Lok Sabha will elect Modi as their leader and it is after that that NaMo will take the responsibility to form the government at the centre.

To discuss on the same, Modi met number of BJP leaders at the Gujarat Bhawan in Delhi. Also, he went to meet the party's veteran leader LK Advani at his residence and then went to meet Murli Manohar Joshi.

Narendra Modi will have to decide on some top BJP leaders including Sushma Swaraj who will play what role in his government. Reports suggest that Advani wants the Lok Sabha Speaker's post as the one on that position does not need to report to the PM directly, whereas Sushma might get an important post in the Cabinet.

RSS who generally plays an important role in taking decisions within BJP, said that they would not decide on the cabinet of Mr Modi. Talking on the same, RSS Spokesperson Ram Madhav said, "Sangh didn't give guideline to anyone. BJP set an agenda which nation accepted, they will decide how to take nation forward. Sangh isn't a remote control nor is it a political organization."
