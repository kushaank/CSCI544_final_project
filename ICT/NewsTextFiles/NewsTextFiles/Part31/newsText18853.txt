
Hong Kong: Asian markets mostly rose on Tuesday following gains on Wall Street, but Thailand’s main index slipped after the army declared martial law following months of deadly anti-government protests.

With little to drive buying action, investors were focusing on the release later in the week of several key economic indicators and minutes from the latest US Federal Reserve policy meeting.

Tokyo rose 0.49%, or 68.81 points, to 14,075.25 after four straight days of losses, Sydney gained 0.21%, or 11.4 points, to 5,420.4 and Hong Kong added 0.57%, or 130.18 points, to 22,834.68.

Shanghai was 0.15% higher, adding 2.94 points to 2,008.12. Seoul ended 0.19% lower, losing 3.88 points to 2,011.26.

US stocks were lifted by a rally in tech shares, which have suffered heavy selling in recent weeks on concerns big-ticket firms such as Twitter and Netflix were overvalued.

The upbeat atmosphere came after Apple and Google said late Friday they were dismissing lawsuits against each other and would work together on patent reform. The good news spread throughout Wall Street.

The Nasdaq rose 0.86%, the Dow added 0.12% and the S&P 500 gained 0.38% on Monday.

Attention now turns to the release of Japanese trade data on Wednesday as well as the Bank of Japan’s latest policy meeting. That will be followed by the release of minutes from the US Federal Reserve’s most recent policy meeting, which will give a better insight into the thinking of board members.

Thursday will see HSBC release its preliminary results on May manufacturing activity in China, with analysts hoping for signs of a pick-up in the world’s number two economy.

The British banking giant will also unveil its early results for the euro zone and United States later Thursday.

In Bangkok the Stock Exchange of Thailand was 1.00% lower after the army’s martial law announcement, which followed almost seven months of anti-government protests that have left 28 people dead and hundreds wounded.

Army officials said the move had been made “to restore peace and order for people from all sides”, stressing that it “is not a coup”.

However, the market pared initial losses of 1.50%, while the baht only eased slightly against the dollar as analysts indicated the move could prove positive for the economy in the long term.

The dollar edged up to 32.51 baht early on Tuesday from 32.47 baht on Monday.

Invesco fund manager Jalil Rasheed said the imposition of martial law was a surprise, given the military has stayed away from the political standoff.

He said Thailand’s brand “is definitely taking a beating” but from a markets perspective, “the largest participants are local retail investors, who have been through this before”.

Despite the long-running political stand-off the Thai stock exchange is still up more than seven percent this year.

It even edged up on Monday after data showed the economy shrank in the first three months of 2014 because of the impact of the disorder on tourism and consumer confidence. The contraction is the first since the end of 2011.
