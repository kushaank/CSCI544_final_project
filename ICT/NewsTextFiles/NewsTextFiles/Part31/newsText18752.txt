Tuesday will be a big day for Noorjan AR of Bagepalli. The PG chemistry student will receive six gold medals and three cash prizes. What the success of the daily wager's daughter sweeter is that she has braved great hardships to reach where she is.

Noorjan completed her BSc from Bagepalli, Chikkaballapur district. She shifted to Bangalore to pursue her dream and there has been no looking back since. She has been paying her examination and hostel fees through scholarships.

"I want to pursue a PhD in organic chemistry and become a professor," Noorjan says. She believes teaching is a noble profession. "I know how difficult it is for a poor student to go for higher studies. I want to conduct free tuitions in Chemistry for PUC, UG and PG students," she adds.

Her parents Abdul Rafiq and Shakila B live in Bagepalli.
