
Physicists are to test 1930s theory that smashing two light particles together at high speed may create matter.

A device that turns light into matter - reminiscent of the replicator gadget in Star Trek - could be created within months.

Physicists at Imperial College London are examining a theory, put forward in 1934, which proposed that smashing two photons - light particles - together could create matter.

The researchers now believe the theory can be tested using a device known as a photon-photon collider.

It will use two complicated methods to create two varied photons - which will then be smashed together to see whether matter is created.

First, a high-intensity laser will be used to speed electrons to nearly the speed of light, then they will then be fired at a slab of gold.

This will beam photons with a billion times more energy than the speed of light.

Secondly, a high-energy laser will be fired into a gold canister, creating thermal radiation equivalent to a star's light.

In a paper submitted to the Nature science journal, the researchers wrote: "This would provide the first realisation of a pure photonâ€“photon collider, representing the advent of a new type of high-energy physics experiment."

The experiment is scheduled to take place within the next year.
