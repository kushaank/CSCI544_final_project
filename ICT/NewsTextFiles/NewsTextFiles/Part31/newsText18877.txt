
KUALA LUMPUR (May 19): Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd (FGV) is expected to report strong first quarter earnings growth on higher crude palm oil (CPO) prices, TA Securities Holdings Bhd said.

Consolidation of Felda Holdings Bhd's (FHB) earnings would have strengthened FGV's financials in the first quarter ended March 31, 2014, according to TA's note today.

"FGV is one of the key beneficiaries of the rally in CPO price – a RM100/tonne change in CPO price will impact EPS by 8%. The company will be releasing its 1Q14 results on May 23.

"We expect strong earnings growth, propelled by higher CPO price and the first-quarterly consolidation of FHB’s earnings," TA said.

TA also commented on news reports regarding FGV's planned acquisition of a major stake in New Britain Palm Oil Ltd, which owns plantations in Papua New Guinea (PNG).

At this juncture, TA said it was still too early to say whether a deal would materialise. TA said it was skeptical that a deal could take place due potential hurdles from PNG regulators.

TA, which maintained its earnings forecasts for the company, said it had also retained its "buy" call for the stock. This came with an unchanged RM5.33 target price.
