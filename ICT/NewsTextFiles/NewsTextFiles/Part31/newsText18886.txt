
As a legislator, and more so as head of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), I intimately appreciate the value of accountability and individual political responsibility in the conduct of public affairs. Indeed accountability is a constitutional tenet. And a moral imperative. If you hold public office, this must inhere in your very soul. As spelt out in Article 73 of the Constitution, “â€¦authority assigned to a State officer is a public trust to be exercised in a manner thatâ€¦brings honour to the nation and dignity to the office, and promotes public confidence in the integrity of the office”. Article 226 (5) further enacts personal liability for financial misadventure.

Having also served as a Cabinet minister only recently, I have had the unique privilege of experiencing accountability and political responsibility from the dialectic angles of the hunter and the hunted. This unique “cocktail” of experiences has taught me that those who bear the mandate to oversight others bear a divine duty. A duty they must exercise with utmost honour and responsibility. In deploying the instruments of oversight they must be as accountable for their actions as those whose deeds they bring under scrutiny. Anything else is double standards. A classic case of preaching water and drinking wine. Ultimately, those who oversight must never forget that they are watchdogs , not bloodhounds.

Their brief is to watch over the public good. Not to hound to hell those mandated to exercise executive power.

It is against this backdrop that we must focus attention on impeachments in the counties. The Embu and Kericho county assemblies have respectively voted to impeach their governors. The first Kiambu county assembly speaker and the Nairobi county executive for Transport have also fallen on this sword. MCAs have been handed a legislative arsenal loaded with a variety of oversight weaponry. They include investigation, caution, naming and shaming, surcharge, censure and impeachment. Of all these, impeachment is the lethal missile.

You don’t fire unless you are crystal clear you have located and isolated the target. The right target. The target whose culpability is beyond doubt. When you press the launch button, you know you will cause maximum damage. And so you don’t take chances. It is not child’s play. Like the mythical Sword of Damocles, this missile’s most potent force lies not in how often it lands, but in the mere horror of the threat of its landing.

I lead from the front in encouraging MCAs to place county regimes under strict scrutiny.

I have personally championed efforts to develop Accountability Kenya, a nationwide joint initiative for all actors in financial accountability. Public Accounts Committees in all 47 counties are part of Accountability Kenya.

I have similarly been consistent in rebuking any county government showing the slightest signs of devolving the bad manners of national government, including corruption, indolence and inertia. And so my caution here must not be mistaken for excusing impropriety.
