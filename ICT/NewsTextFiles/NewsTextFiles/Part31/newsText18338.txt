
The owners of Corby’s Golden Wonder factory, will today announce a multi-million investment in the plant.

The funds have enabled the Tayto Group Limited to extend its technical capabilities to include a dedicated hand-fried line, creating around 60 new jobs for the local community, bringing the total number employed at the factory to more than 550.

The significant investment was commended by MP, Andy Sawford, and local councillors, who visited the factory for a tour of the new equipment.

Paul Allen, CEO of the Tayto Group, said: “Tayto is investing heavily in upgrading machinery and increasing efficiency across our sites.

“We were delighted to welcome the MP and local councillors along to hear our news and to view the new hand-fried line, which will produce around two million bags of handfried crisps per week.

“It will also allow us to expand into vegetable crisps and we hope to make some exciting announcements on this in due course.

“We have begun recruiting for 60-65 operators who will work on this line, which is a new technology for the factory.

“We have also recently upgraded other equipment across the Corby site, with 14 new, cutting-edge, packing machines now operational.

Corby and East Northamptonshire MP Andy Sawford, said: “It is great news that Tayto are investing in their Corby site and creating 60 new jobs for the town.

“Corby is the manufacturing capital of the UK and Tayto’s decision to expand its operations and begin production of a new line of crisp shows confidence in the skills and motivation of local workers.

“The company knows that both I and the Borough Council are keen to support local businesses to succeed.
