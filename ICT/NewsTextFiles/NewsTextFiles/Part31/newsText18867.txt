The president unveiled her plans to make a safer Korea and gave a tearful recognition to those who sacrificed their lives while saving ferry victims or searching for missing passengers.

Meanwhile, the presidential office says the president will appoint a new prime minister and carry out a Cabinet reshuffle after her current two-day trip to the UAE, where she will attend an event marking the installment of a nuclear reactor built by South Korea.
