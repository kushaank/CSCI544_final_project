
A housekeeper has been charged with stealing £500,000 of antiques and art including a Picasso sketch from her aristocratic boss.

Kim Roberts, 58, of Colyton, Devon, is accused of taking valuable items from the Dowager Countess Bathurst, while working at her grand Cotswolds estate and Kensington home.

Roberts appeared at Gloucester Crown Court on Friday facing three counts of theft, including one count from another previous employer.

She is accused of theft between April 30 and May 21 last year of of art  and antiques to the value of approximately £500,000 from Gloria, the Dowager Countess Bathurst at her Cirencester home.

The Crown Prosecution Service also say she stole antique vases between  April 30 2013 and August 20 2013 from the Dowager's west London home.

A timetable for progress of her case was set and she was told to return to court for a plea and case management hearing on August 8.

Her trial, expected to last three days, was listed to begin in the week of November 3.

The Dowager Countess, who lives in a farmhouse on her family's vast Cirencester Park Estate, is the widow of the eighth Earl Bathurst, Henry, who died in 2011 aged 84.

Their son Allen, formerly Lord Apsley, is now the 9th Earl and lives in the Cirencester Park mansion house with his wife Sara.

Bailing Ms Roberts, the judge made it a condition that she resides at her Devon home and notifies the court if she moves address.
