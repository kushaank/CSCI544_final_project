
Representatives from the Mississippi Board of Animal Health, Natural Resource Conservation Service, Farm Service Agency, U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency were on hand to answer farmers’ questions about recovery resources.

Information about the recovery process was also provided by personnel from the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce, MSU Extension Service, Mississippi Cattlemen’s Association, Mississippi Farm Bureau Federation, Mississippi Forestry Commission and the Mississippi Poultry Association.

The four-hour event was offered to address specific recovery needs related to poultry, cattle and timber.

The MSU Extension Service organized the event at the request of Winston County Emergency Management Director Buddy King, who said he hopes it will be a pattern for the future.

Winston County poultry growers Brenda Goodin and her mother, Marie Myers, lost two poultry houses, several thousand birds, their homes, barn and other farm buildings. They met with Natural Resource Conservation Service representatives at the center.

What Goodin and Myers are experiencing is typical of what is happening to many farm families in Winston and surrounding counties hit by the late April tornadoes, said Extension Poultry Specialist Tom Tabler.

While the Agriculture Disaster Center in Winston County may be a first, Extension Service partnerships at the local level are nothing new, said MSU Extension Director Gary Jackson.
