
(ANSA)-Rome, May 19 - Britain's Prince Harry climaxed his trip to Italy with a surprise visit to the Colosseum on Monday, marking the first time he has gone inside the Flavian amphitheatre.      The prince was met by the director of the monument, Rossella Rea, and Barbara Nazaro, the young architect who accompanied U.S. President Obama on his visit to the Colosseum in March.      Harry wore jeans, an open-necked shirt and Clarks shoes for the trip and was accompanied by Barbara Nazaro, who guided Michelle Obama and her daughters around the Colosseum in 2009.      Harry paid for his own entrance ticket and treated his staff to tickets he also paid for as other tourists continued to throng the monument despite cloudy skies over the Eternal City.
