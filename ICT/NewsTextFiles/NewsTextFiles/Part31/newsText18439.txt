
While Canadian Prime Minister Stephan Harper has had two mentions and Russian President Putin received warm words on Monday, Modi has conspicuously made no reference at all to the leaders of the world's superpower.

Had a telephonic conversation with @pmharper . Thanked him for his wishes & talked about our commitment to strengthen India-Canada relations.

Washington, along with European powers, had boycotted the 63-year-old for a decade and denied him a visa over the 2002 Gujarat riots. Modi was refused the diplomatic visa by the US in 2005.

Kerry tweeted congratulations to Modi on Friday after a landslide win for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), saying he looked forward to "growing shared prosperity/security".

US President Barack Obama telephoned Modi but is yet to comment in person. He had warm words for Modi's predecessor on Saturday, however.

Japanese premier Shinzo Abe meanwhile was thanked for his good wishes.

"Hoping to further strengthen India-UK relations," Modi wrote.
