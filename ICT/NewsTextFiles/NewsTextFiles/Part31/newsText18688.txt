
Former Member of Parliament for Okaikoi South, Nana Akomea has blamed lack of due diligence in the award of contracts for the numerous corruption scandals in government.

He described as unfortunate the wanton dissipation of public funds by government appointees at the expense of the ordinary Ghanaian who are wallowing in abject poverty.

Nana Akomea made the comment while discussing a 14 –member technical committee’s report that justified the payment of 74 million cedis to IT firm, Suba Info Solutions Limited.

Subah was alleged to have collected 144 million cedis for no work done after it was contracted by the Ghana Revenue Authority in 2010 to provide telecom traffic monitoring services for revenue verification for the tax agency.

But a government investigative committee exonerated the firm arguing that Subah justifiably incurred cost in executing the contract for which reason it was paid 74.3 million cedis and not 144 million cedis.

The Ghana Chamber of Telecommunications has rejected the committee’s report maintaining that the IT firm has been paid for no work done.

In support, Nana Akomea on Asempa FM’s Ekosii Sen programme Monday said the Subah rot is a clear case of “create, loot and share”.

He intimated that in its bid to ensure all its cronies get their share of the national cake; government has “deliberately” created the enabling environment for people to loot.

Citing similar corruption scandals involving the Ghana Youth and Entrepreneurial Development Agency (GYEEDA) and the Savannah Accelerated Development Authority (SADA), dubious judgement debts paid to Woyome, Waterville and CP, the Okaikoi South MP said “it is like there is a pattern to steal from the state”.

Obviously appalled by the situation, he stressed that “If this is not a calculated ploy to steal monies, how does this happen? It is amazing how the government can sit down and pay monies for no work done”.
