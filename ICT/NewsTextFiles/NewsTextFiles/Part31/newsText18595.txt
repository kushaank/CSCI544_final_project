
NEW YORK - The London imam Abu Hamza al-Masri was convicted of terrorism charges in New York on Monday, following a four-week trial that shined a spotlight on the preacher's controversial anti-Western statements.

A jury of eight men and four women found Abu Hamza, 56, guilty on all 11 counts he faced, handing Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara his second high-profile terrorism conviction in three months. The defendant could face life in prison.

In March, a different jury found Osama bin Laden's son-in-law Suleiman Abu Ghaith guilty of terrorism-related charges.
