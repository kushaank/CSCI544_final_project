
OXON HILL, Md. (WNEW) — A take-out restaurant in Prince George’s County may be closed for an extended period of time after a vehicle crashed through the front of its building early Monday morning.

Authorities say a burgundy SUV barreled into the Danny’s Carryout in the 6200 block of Oxon Hill Road in Oxon Hill while the store still was open Monday morning. The vehicle came to rest at the restaurant’s front counter.

One person was seriously injured in the crash but authorities haven’t disclosed if it was the driver or someone inside the restaurant.

Police don’t know what caused the driver to lose control of the vehicle.

A building inspector has been called to the scene to determine if towing the vehicle will cause more damage to the building.

This is the second time a vehicle has crashed into a Danny’s restaurant in the past three months. An SUV crashed into the side of a Danny’s in Temple Hills back in March.
