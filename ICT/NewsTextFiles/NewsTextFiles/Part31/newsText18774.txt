
MOGADISHU: A Somali politician was wounded Monday in a bomb blast in the latest in a string of attacks in the war ravaged capital Mogadishu, a local official said.

"The bomb was attached to his car... seriously injuring him," local district commissioner Abdulkadir Mohamed Abdulkadir told AFP.

The politician, former city commissioner Farah Dahir Jimale, was rushed to hospital. One passerby was also wounded.

No group claimed immediate responsibility, but Somalia's Al-Qaeda-linked Shebab rebels carry out regular attacks, and have vowed to topple the internationally-backed government.

The Shebab have been driven out of fixed positions in Somalia's major towns by the UN-mandated AU force, but still launch attacks that include bombings and guerrilla-style raids.

Recent Shebab attacks have targeted key areas of government or the security forces, in an apparent bid to discredit claims by the authorities that they are winning the war against the fighters.

The Shebab on Monday said it had attacked an army convoy across the border in Kenya and killed several soldiers, but Kenya's army denied it suffered any casualties.
