A memorial Service has been organised Monday at the Flagstaff House in honour of the late Chairman of the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC) Dr PV Obeng who died last Saturday.

Led by the Catholic Priest Father Campbell, the President John Mahama, his ministers and other appointees of government all gathered at the Â seat of government to pay respect to a fallen hero, a statesman who had played a pivotal role in Ghana's young democracy.

PV Obeng collapsed while driving along the Spintex road in Accra and died shortly before he was driven to the Lekma Hospital in Teshie.

He was suspected to have died from an asthma attack.

Tributes have since been pouring in from political leaders and people from all walks of life, applauding the calmness and cool-headedness PV brought to Ghana's politics.

Addressing a group of mourners at a memorial service organised in honour of the late Senior Presidential Advisor, Reverend Father Andrew Campbell, the Parish Priest of Christ the King Catholic Church said the late PV Obeng was a God fearing man who went about his job with diligence and selflessness.

Joy News' presidential correspondent, Seth Kwame Boateng reported the Catholic Priest as saying, PV also contributed immensely towards the development of the Catholic Church.

The family is however yet to make public funeral activities of the late PV Obeng.
