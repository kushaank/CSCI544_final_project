
The Ghana Journalists Association (GJA), has condemned Daily Guide’s front page story on the death of Mr Paul Victor Obeng, which, showed his mortal remains being stretchered off to the morgue.

The GJA described the front-page story on the death of Mr Obeng in the Monday edition of the Daily Guide newspaper headlined: “How PV Died” and a photograph showing him as not only inhumane but in bad taste.

“This is a violation of the GJA Code of Ethics and should be totally condemned.” it added.

A statement issued by the President of the Association Mr Affail Monney after an executive emergency meeting, said: Article 2 of the GJA Code of Ethics required that “In collecting and disseminating information, the journalist should bear in mind his/her responsibility to the public at large and the various interests in society”.

“There is no doubt that the paper’s coverage had shown gross insensitivity and disrespect on an issue concerning the death of a mortal. This is bound to hurt family members, other relations and friends of PV,” it said.

The statement stated portions of Article 5 of the Code on Respect for Privacy and Human Dignity request that “journalists should respect the right of the individual to privacy and human dignity. Enquiries and intrusions into a person’s private life can only be justified when done in the public interest.

It said Daily Guide has willfully disregarded Article 16 of the GJA Code which states that “in cases of personal grief, distress, journalists should exercise tact and diplomacy in seeking information and publishing”.
