
the muttahida qaumi movement (mqm) chief altaf hussain has revealed that the british government has frozen all his bank accounts in the united kingdom.

regarding his national identity card altaf said he has warts on his legs and feet and therefore cannot walk properly. however he managed to come to the mqm’s secretariat in london where nadra officials carried out the procedure.

“now they are saying the data has gone corrupt? do the prime minister and the interior minister want me to beg for my pakistaniat (pakistani identity)? i don’t want this charity from them.” he said he was disappointed with the sindh governor for remaining silent in the recent meeting with nawaz sharif. “they were putting false accusations on us but the governor did not say anything and remained quiet.

meanwhile the mqm has deferred planned protest rallies over non-issuance of identity card and passport to altaf hussain following firm assurance from the federal government in this regard.

earlier interior minister chaudhry nisar ali khan had stated that the mqm chief had not followed prescribed procedures for applying the two facilities.

he had further stated that former high commissioner wajid shamsul hasan had violated rules by taking a staffer of the embassy along with equipment for finger prints to the residence of altaf hussain only a day before leaving his office. the data was automatically deleted in the nadra system because proper procedures were not adopted.
