
A Sentinel reconnaissance aircraft left RAF Waddington bound for the Ghanian capital of Accra, west of Nigeria and close to where Islamist terror group Boko Haram are believed to be holding the Chibok girls.

The high-tech surveillance jet will assist US aircraft in attempting to find the schoolgirls, who were abducted in their school on April 15.

British Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: “The kidnap of these girls is a reprehensible act which has drawn international condemnation.

The plane is fitted with radar which can locate moving targets and provide detailed pictures of activity on the ground.

The jet is operated by a five-man crew and is capable of flying for significant periods of time at high altitude.

“The Sentinel with its wide area search capability and long endurance is perfect for this task,” said Rich Barrow, RAF Waddington’s station commander.

On Saturday, Foreign Secretary William Hague urged West African countries to unite in order to defeat Boko Haram during a crisis meeting in Paris.

Mr Hague added that the UK and other nations must do more to support regions where Boko Haram operates.

“More will need to be done in the north of Nigeria in terms of clean water, healthcare, education and so on,” he said.
