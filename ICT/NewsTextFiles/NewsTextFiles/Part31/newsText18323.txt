
Previously known as Game Retail, the company, which has 560 stores across the UK and Spain, yesterday revealed its intention to list on the London Stock Exchange within the next month to help clear debts of more than £120m.

Game has since halved its UK store count to 327 but maintained market share by growing its online gaming presence and capitalising on last year’s launches of Xbox One and Playstation 4. Mr Gibbs said it had also reduced its reliance on new releases of games and consoles.

Game, now owned by the hedge fund firm Elliott Advisors, expects to make £12m from the float, after costs, including underwriting fees, of £8m. The funds will be reinvested in the business to support growth, Game said.

Mr Gibbs denied that the company was looking to ride the recent IPO wave among retailers, as investors begin to exercise caution. Last week shares in Card Factory slid as much as 10 per cent, while  Patisserie Valerie was priced at the bottom end of its price range.

Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said investors are still nursing “burnt fingers” over Game’s administration. He added, however,  that its rationalised store base and digital development have improved its prospects.
