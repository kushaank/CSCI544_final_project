Thousands of children may be left homeless by the end of the year and those already affected are suffering “fear, uncertainty and isolation”, Barnardos has warned.

Mr Finlay said many of the children of families left homeless were living in overcrowded places with nowhere to play. More than 1,350 parents and children are without their own home in Dublin.

“In some of the accommodation that’s available, children will see violence, abuse and drug use.

He called on the Government to act quickly to address rising rents, discrimination in the private rental sector, inappropriateness of emergency accommodation and lack of social housing.

“The lack of investment in social housing in recent years, cuts to rent supplement and the rising cost of renting in the private market are creating a perfect storm for homelessness. We should have been able to predict and prevent this,” he said.

Emma Jane Nulty, Barnardos’ project leader, said the charity was seeing an “escalating” number of cases of families being evicted  from their rented accommodation and left homeless daily.

“Absolutely there’s a crises and it's snowballing,” she said.

Ms Nulty said in some cases the housing issues were so severe they had raised child welfare issues due to unsafe accommodation or the impact on parents.

“It’s awful to see because you know it’s costing everyone more, both in terms of the impact it’s having on children and parents and the financial cost to the State,” she said.
