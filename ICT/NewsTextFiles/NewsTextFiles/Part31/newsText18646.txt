
The UK government has signed a "letter of intent" with the Israeli government about joint funding for cyber research.

The letter follows a memorandum of understanding signed by The Office of Cyber Security and Information Assurance in the Cabinet Office and the Israeli government in 2013.

There is an agreement that Â£1.2 million of joint funding will be used to fund a cyber research initiative through the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).

These areas are identity management, governance - regulating cyber security, privacy assurance and perceptions, mobile and cloud security, human aspects of security or usable security, and cryptography.

The EPSRC is asking for proposals for joint research activities to be submitted until 24 June 2014.
