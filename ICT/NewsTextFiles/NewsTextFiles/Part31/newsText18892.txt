
Information related to the Maltese delegation to the Eurovision Song Contest were not given out after a parliamentary question, with the government saying the information was of a commercial nature and would not be divulged.

Last week, The Malta Independent queried the cost that was involved, but while PBS assured the public that the visit was not funded by taxpayers money, no solid information was given.

Opposition MP Francis Zammit Dimech asked Minister Manuel Mallia about the composition of the government and PBS delegation for the Eurovision Song Contest, the names of the delegation members, their role and the expenses made from public funds. But while the minister said that he wanted to assure the MP that the delegation was not any bigger than the pastÂ  and the costs were lower, he did not divulge more information.

He said that this year this initiative was taken on a commercial basis and therefore the information that was requested was of a commercial nature.

What a load of nonsense. This is a Public matter as it was the public that voted them in to be elected to participate in the Eurovision, so get on with it, publish it and govern in the right way.

... ahhh the transparency we were promised before the election - they don't even honour it on the small matters let alone the big contracts! Tmejlu bil-pajjiz u issa qed jiffangaw qishom imgewhin!
