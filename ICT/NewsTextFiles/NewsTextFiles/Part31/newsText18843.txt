
BANGALORE: The fact that the BJP has won a landslide victory in the 16th Lok Sabha polls has, inevitably, drawn Chief executives and leading corporate lawyers to pitch for a tough stand. With the new government coming in the worrisome issue of taxation would be the top priority, to restore the confidence of investors in India, as reported by Rediff.

The retrospective taxation issue passed by the UPA government has certainly troubled the global investors as well as the local players in which many projects are stuck with billions of investment with the government for approvals.

Rabindra Jhunjhunwala, partner, Khaitan & Co said that, â€œThe retrospective taxation issue has deterred foreign investors since the law was passed by the UPA government." With that, he also made it clear that the new government can state a tax on transactions that will not be applied on a retrospective basis. He also stated that, this it will be a huge sentiment booster and a follow-up decision can be taken in the coming Budget, which will henceforth help companies such as Vodafone, Nokia and Shell, in a legal battle with the government over old tax issues.
