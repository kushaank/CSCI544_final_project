
Instead, they protested after the Vietnam Veterans Chapter was told to not bring its tiger cage. Even the police and fire color guards sat out in solidarity.

“To tell them they can’t be there or that they have to change their history to be there is just wrong,” said one person at the meeting.

“At least three cages were in the parade this year with live people in them,” said Ben Wiese.

Council Bluffs Mayor Mat Walsh apologized to the veterans even though the City Council reiterated that the city didn’t organize the Celebrate CB event.

“I don’t think anyone intentionally tried to slight the organization. I honestly believe that. I don’t think they had an appreciation for how deeply it offended you,” said Walsh.

There will likely be a meeting Wednesday with members of the veteran community, specifically Vietnam Veterans Chapter 798 who uses the tiger cage as a reminder and members of Celebrate CB.
