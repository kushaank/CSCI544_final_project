
Pfizer raises the stakes â€” and some eyebrows â€” in its offer for AstraZeneca.

Pfizer made what it's calling its fourth and final offer for AstraZeneca , submitting a proposal to buy the company for $117 billion â€” after previously bidding $106 billion on May 2.

The latest proposal increases the cash component of the offer to 45 percent from 33 percent.

In addition, Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) said it will not make a hostile offer directly to AstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN) shareholders, meaning it will only proceed with a deal if it gets the recommendation of AstraZenecaâ€™s board.

Pfizerâ€™s plan to merge with AstraZeneca would include putting the combined company's headquarters in London to take advantage of substantial tax savings. A deal would also bolster Pfizerâ€™s pipeline of new drug candidates, particularly new therapies for treating cancer, at a time when Pfizer is dealing with generic competition for Lipitor and the looming loss of patent protection for Viagra.

The two companies have strong ties to the local region. AstraZeneca, based in London, has its U.S. headquarters in Wilmington, Del. Pfizer, based in New York, has operations in Collegeville, Pa. Elected officials in Delaware have expressed concerns about job losses in their state should the merger happen.

Ian Read , chairman and CEO of Pizer, in a prepared statement, said he believes the revised offer is â€œcompellingâ€� for AstraZeneca's shareholders and that a Pfizer-AstraZeneca combination â€œis in the best interestsâ€� of all stakeholders.
