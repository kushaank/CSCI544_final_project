
The Croatia center back has heard reports the Champions League side is interested in his services but isn't in a rush to leave St. Mary's.

Southampton defender Dejan Lovren will not attempt to engineer a move to Liverpool amid reported interest from the Merseyside club.

The Croatia international has emerged as one the most reliable center backs in the Premier League, and Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has reportedly taken note of his eye-catching displays.

Lovren is thought to be in demand from other top-flight clubs and, although the 24-year-old is not actively seeking a move, he is not ruling out a switch from St. Mary's ahead of next season.

"I have heard about the speculation as well, that is I read about the Liverpool interest in a newspaper," he told Croatian newspaper Sportske Novosti. "That is all I know so far. I feel great at Southampton and I have three years left on my contract, meaning the club will decide on my future."

Lovren joined the South-coast club from Lyon on a four-year deal last June and made 31 appearances in the English top flight in his debut campaign.
