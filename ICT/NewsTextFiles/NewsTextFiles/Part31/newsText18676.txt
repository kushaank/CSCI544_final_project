
Recently, the two who have kept their affair public since their romantic heat blared after they met during the continental reality show met in Ghana where Elikem proposed to Pokello.

“If we are not already married, you will hear wedding bells soon,” Elikem is quoted as having said building speculations that they are already living under one roof.

Elikem actually proposed to Pokello on stage during the 2014 Vodafone Ghana Music Awards, which were held at the Accra International Conference Centre (AICC) about two weeks ago.

The two were on stage to present the award for Best collaboration of the Year when Elikem suddenly went down on one knee and popped the question; “Will you marry me?”.

Surprised Pokello said; “Yes!” However, all might not be well as a 28-year-old fashion designer Theresa Boateng has announced that she is pregnant with Elikem’s child.

It will be interesting to note what “Stunner” will do next. Perhaps he will sing another song, “Inga mahure anotozochata”. Its getting worse than he had in mind.

Well dun pokello let them call you names okusalayo u are happy .
