A Colombian presidential ticket never had two men that were so rude and low as Santos and Vice  president Germán Vargas Lleras treating an elected official as a "gamin" or "street ( abandoned ) child", an urchin, and even if never elected nobody should be treated as "Gamín".

Juan Manuel Santos in his villainy says that Oscar Ivan Zuluaga is a "Puppet" and OIZ retorts and replicates very seriously and firmly telling him to respect other candidates.

Juan Manuel Santos is not only coarse but a Superliar --- He denies that Zuluaga saved Colombia from Recession ( being Finance Minister ) while the Rest of the World was in great trouble.

And Oscar Ivan retorts back with pride: "You are in pain, because I was so cataloged inernationally, I was minister during the worst time of global recession and saved Colombia from great economic pain."

Juan Manuel Santos is violating the separation of powers and becomes Prosecutor and Judge against Andrés Sepúlveda condemning this man as "Delinquent", "Offender", "Criminal" and "Hacker" and hints that OIZ and his friends are criminals and hackers .

No one has proven that Sepulveda is a hacker or criminal. That's up to justice and not the president.

Santos has been continuously violating the Constitution and laws, to give Heaven and Earth to FARC Narcos and terrorists.

Santos wants to be reelected with the help of FARC BOMBS in populated places, FARC using Kids as Bombs ( they died in the process ! ), FARC plants field Explosive Mines, booby traps, and recruits children to throw them against the Colombian Army while FARC leaders take shelter behind to be out of danger.
