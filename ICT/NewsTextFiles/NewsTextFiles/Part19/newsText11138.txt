South Bend, Ind. The last of the Downtown South Bend businesses transitioned off generator power Monday, as the City’s shops and restaurants assessed the damage of up to 3 days without power.

“It's definitely going to make a dent,” said Philip Schreiber, owner of Chicory Café, which was in the dark the entire weekend.

Schreiber said he plans to file a lost business claim with his insurance company.

And it wasn’t just businesses that were feeling the hurt. More than 800 residents we’re affected by the outage, and many of them were residential.

“Elevators weren't working there were some elderly people living in my apartment. So definitely, it was some trouble,” said Rudy Reyes, General Manager of Jimmy John's, who also lives in South Bend.

The St. Joseph County Public Library also experienced some serious technical difficulties as a result of the blackout.

The library is the database hub for several area libraries, which were in turn affected by South Bend’s outage.

“We have been working during the power outage on some contingencies plans and things to make sure that this doesn't happen again if it can at all be prevented,” Schafer said.
