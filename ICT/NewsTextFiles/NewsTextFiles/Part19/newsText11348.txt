
In the Journal’s Top Workplaces special section published Sunday, companies responding to a question of how they are adjusting to the effects of the Affordable Care Act said it has not been a major issue so far, but it has required a commitment of employees and time to make sure they understand it and are in compliance.

The 20 of the top 40 businesses and organizations that responded to the question said employee health care remains a key benefit.

Small to medium organizations and businesses such as the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center, Hosanna/Faith Comes By Hearing, Santa Ana Star Casino, New Mexico Military Institute, Range Cafe and Mark Pardo SalonSpa said the health-care overhaul has not required much of an adjustment.

Most don’t need to make any changes until next year because of their size. Several said they are keeping employees informed and are working with a broker or insurance agency to make sure they are in compliance.

But several noted increased costs associated with the ACA.

Hematology Oncology Associates PC said it is seeing higher costs for patients.

“We are finding that patients are experiencing changes to their insurance plans that are creating higher amounts of co-insurance and patient out-of-pockets than they have ever experienced before,” the company said in an online response.

Several companies specifically noted they have shifted focus to full-time employees because of ACA requirements.

The home-care business said field staff may well decide they would rather pay a little extra for more benefits.

Many of the Top Workplaces said wellness programs have become an important component of what they offer.
