
BENIN CITY – Nigerians in Diaspora have been enjoined to come back home and invest in their country, rather than encouraging ‘capital flight’.

Head of Administration, Faith Triumphant Wordship, Ikpoba Hill, Benin City, Evangelist Eddison Oduagbon Erhaighewu gave the charge during the commissioning of an Education centre in Uvbe, Uhunmwode Local Government Area.

Evang. Erhaighewu noted that investing in Nigeria will lead to opening of avenues for job creation for the teeming youths that are roaming the streets.

He affirmed that the ministry established since about 17 years ago was desirous to giving back to the society through quality education, hence the establishment of the educational arm of the ministry.

He pointed out that the donor, Pastor Lucky Erhaighewu established the education centre because of his passion to improve and advance the wellbeing of the downtrodden educationally.

Djalma Barroso who led the Brazilian born missionaries lauded the donor’s initiative, describing it as a welcome development for the people.
