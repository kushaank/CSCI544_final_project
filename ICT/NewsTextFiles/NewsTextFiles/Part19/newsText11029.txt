
Mining giant Rio Tinto expects to sign an agreement to push ahead with the troubled $US20 billion ($A21.64 billion) Simandou iron ore project in Guinea.

The company expects to sign an "investment framework" later this month to formalise its partnership with the government of Guinea in west Africa, Chinese-owned corporation Chalco and the World Bank's International Finance Corporation, Rio Tinto chief executive Sam Walsh says.

"This has taken some time to bring to fruition and I think this signing will inject the project with renewed momentum," Mr Walsh said in a speech in Washington over the weekend.

Mr Walsh said Rio had committed to revenue sharing through the government of Guinea's ownership stake in the mine and the company expected to pay taxes and royalties to Guinea of about $US1.2 billon ($A1.30 billon).

"This isn't just a partnership between a mining company and a government," he said.

"It is also a partnership with a customer, and a development financier."

The Simandou range has one of the largest, high-grade iron-ore deposits in the world, but it is around 650 kilometres from a Guinean port.

Rio is suing Brazilian miner Vale and an Israeli company over the rights to develop the Simandou iron ore deposit.

The complaint relates to the loss of half of Rio Tinto's mining concession in the Simandou region in 2008.

The company alleges billionaire Beny Steinmetz and his company BSG Resources bribed officials and conspired with Vale to steal mining rights.
