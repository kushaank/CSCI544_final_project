
Banco do Brasil Americas filed plans to open its first branch in Orlando.

The Miami-based bank, a subsidiary of one of the largest banks in Brazil, told regulators it wants to put a branch at 5403 International Drive.That would be its sixth office.

The bank currently has two branches in Boca Raton, its main office on Miami's Brickell Avenue and a branch in Pompano Beach. It previously filed an application to open a branch in Doral.

Since entering South Florida though the acquisition of a small bank several years ago, Banco do Brasil has been growing by attracting customers from the large population of Brazilians here. As of March 31, the bank had $153 million in assets, $110.6 million in deposits and $69.1 million in loans. Its largest lending category was residential mortgages, followed by commercial real estate loans.

Banco do Brasil Americas had enough capital to more than double in size.

Florida is the top U.S. destination for Brazilian tourists, so it makes sense that Banco do Brasil would want to be on Mickey Mouse's doorstep.
