SMALL Business Advisory Service program manager Sue Rudd has a passion for supporting small business operators and building their capacity to be successful.

For seven years, Sue has been involved with Sunraysia Rural Counselling Service (SRCS), which oversees the small business program, as part of a team established to “build resilient rural communities” in the Murray-Mallee region.

Sue said while there were numerous workshops available, many of her clients preferred to access advice and information on a one-to-one basis.

“Being involved in a home-based business, I’m familiar with the difficulties and issues that small businesses face,” she said.

Within her role, Sue is supported to develop flexible and innovative solutions to local issues.

“An example of this approach is the recent formation of the ‘Women Advancing Rural Communities’ – a group established to build the capacity of women in our region.

Being involved in this group, Sue was exposed to the Northern Mallee Leaders Program and was accepted into the 2014 participant intake for the 10-month skills development course that started in February.

Sue has been working closely with Mildura Tourism and Mildura City where she put together two workshops specifically designed to optimise the opportunities for small business during last weekend’s triple j One Night Stand event.
