
Hanwha SolarOne Co. Ltd. (Shanghai) has completed construction of a 31 MW solar photovoltaic (PV) project located on multiple rooftop sites in Southern China's Guangdong Province.

The company describes the project as part of a business development agreement with a “large, well-established” state-owned company. The agreement includes plans for Hanwha SolarOne and the company to build additional PV plants across China.

“We have successfully completed other large-scale engineering, procurement and construction contracts in China and will use this track record to assist us in developing our PV project portfolio as an IPP, as well as other additional downstream activities,” noted Hanwha SolarOne CEO Jay Seo.

Hanwha SolarOne notes that the Chinese government is encouraging the development of distributed generation across the United States with new incentives and other policies.
