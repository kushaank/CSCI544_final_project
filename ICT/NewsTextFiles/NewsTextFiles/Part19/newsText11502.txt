
COLORADO SPRINGS,Colo.--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Storage industry innovator X-IO Technologies has underlined the        capability of its ISE performance storage array to support long term        business growth and its five-year relationship with Shepherd Chemical        Company (SCC).

SCC has a vast and growing amount of mission critical data which needs        to be accessed and shared on continual basis. SCC installed X-IO’s ISE        solution five years ago as part of its move to a modern, efficient and        reliable IT infrastructure. The ISE has since ensured business        continuity for SCC during a period of rapid growth. It has also provided        faster data storage access, increased capacity and reduced bottlenecks.

X-IO’s ISE delivers predictable and consistent performance for SCC, and        reduces the need for IT staff to manage and watch over data.

X-IO Technologies is the only hardware company to have solved some of        the fundamental challenges of Enterprise Storage. X-IO’s Intelligent        Storage Element (ISE) architecture, invented as a division of Seagate        Technology, addresses the demand of customers for long duty cycle        storage, the demand of 100% capacity utilization without loss of        performance, and uniquely does not require service intervention during        its lifetime.

Based in Colorado, the organization has offices throughout North        America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa and has a proven        installation of over 6,000 units across in excess of 1,200 customers        worldwide.
