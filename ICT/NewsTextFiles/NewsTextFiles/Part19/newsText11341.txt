
Regulation-compliant cloud services provider Online Tech is expanding into Indianapolis with a $10 million data center investment, the company announced Wednesday. Online Tech has purchased the property for what will be a 44,000 square foot data center supporting a three megawatt electrical load.

The facility is connected to an extensive fiber optic network which will provide customers with choices among network providers.

The Indianapolis facility will be the company’s first outside of Michigan, and will provide services to local businesses as well as benefitting existing customers with the disaster recovery and back up assurances of geographic separation.

The new data center will be staffed by 25 permanent IT workers, and is expected to become operational in Q3.

Indianapolis was chosen after consideration of “the entire Great Lakes region” according to Co-CEO Yan Ness, and the company plans to eventually expand into other Great Lakes markets.
