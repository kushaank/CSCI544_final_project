BARBADOS may be in danger of running afoul of international life-saving standards by having little more than half of the minimum number of required lifeguards on its beaches.

DAILY NATION investigations revealed yesterday that, as of May 15 (last Thursday), only 55 lifeguards were on daily duty at the 17 stations.

In fact, sources revealed that only 67 lifeguards were currently employed by the National Conservation Commission (NCC), when ideally there should be a minimum of 102, based on international practice.

“As of [May 15], there are 67 actual lifeguards; five are currently on leave, seven are senior staff, which is one instructor, one supervisor, one chief lifeguard and four seniors, so 55 are active on the sites,” one source explained.

Three are on sick leave, one on maternity leave and the other on leave without pay.
