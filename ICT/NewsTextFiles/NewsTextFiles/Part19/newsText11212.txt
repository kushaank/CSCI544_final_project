
New Zealand's wine industry has undergone a massive $1 billion export increase over the past 10 years.

Wine is now the country's eighth biggest export good, worth $1.3 billion currently, with that expected to grow to more than $2 billion by 2024.

However, industry experts are worried the high NZ dollar could threaten the advance of the flourishing industry.

"The NZ dollar is too high. If we could get that down that would be a major plus," said Lindsay McLachlan, managing director of Peregrine Wines in Central Otago.

New Zealand currently produces less than 1% of the world's wine, but growers are slowly beginning to push their way into overseas markets.

London-based wine taster Bob Campbell believes the quality of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir is starting to get worldwide recognition.

"But others are coming through as well," he said. "And they open the door for other styles and it's a snowball effect."

Just like quality bottles, the country's wine industry as a whole is also set to improve with age, said Mr McLachlan.

"We are starting to see some benefit from vine age, which is just at the very start of that process and we'll see better and better fruit come, I think also though we're seeing significant increases in abilities and expertise in the vineyard," he said.

"There's enormous future in China. We're really at the start and an amazing amount of education is required there, they're definitely going to be a significant player."
