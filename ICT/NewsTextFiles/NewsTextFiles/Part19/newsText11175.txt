
The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has issued a circular outlining detailed procedure to be followed by insurers to ensure timely payment of unclaimed insurance benefits. The SECP has observed that significant amounts are lying with the insurers on account of unclaimed benefits. The large chunk relates to unclaimed life insurance maturity benefits.

The circular requires the insurers to disclose the unclaimed benefits in their financial statements separately. It also requires that as a matter of accounting policy no insurer can write back, ie remove its liabilities on account of unclaimed benefits. A format for the regulatory reporting has also been introduced to ensure that the insurers hand down benefits in a timely manner.

In addition, the SECP has required the insurers to carry out a search process for the unclaimed maturity benefits due under a life insurance policy. For this purpose, an insurer may establish and subsequently use a procedure to utilise the Nadra's database to get up-to-date information about the policyholders and their beneficiaries. Similar requirements have been placed in respect of unclaimed death and other benefits.
