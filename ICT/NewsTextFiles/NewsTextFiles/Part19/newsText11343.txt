KANSAS CITY, Mo., May 19, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- APT Group, Inc., a propulsion technology company that manufactures and distributes advanced, environmentally friendly transportation, recreation and utility powersport products (www.powerapt.com), today announced that it has been invited to present the Sonic Flow CSI engine to space industry leaders and experts in the Space Power Systems category at the upcoming Space Resources and Planetary & Terrestrial Mining Sciences Symposium at the Colorado School of Mines.

The specific focus of these meetings is to advance prospects for the commercial development of space resources.  The meeting convenes on June 10-11, 2014 at the Colorado School of Mines, in Golden, CO.

Space exploration organizations such as NASA are seeking an ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) Solar Independent Propulsion for Lunar Polar Exploration rovers.  The challenge is recharging Rover battery power systems without access to solar energy.  The Sonic Flow CSI is an exotic ICE (internal combustion engine) and is considered to be one of the leading prospects for this solicitation.

The meeting will be organized to accommodate technical presentations, expert panels on specific topics, and roundtable discussions with all conference attendants. As with all past SRR conferences, the white papers generated from these discussions provide decision makers with technically sound recommendations for incorporating space resources into new exploration programs.

"The SonicFlow(TM) engine holds mission critical advancements necessary for the hyper technological demands of Space Exploration and also able to satisfy current environmental crises.  The SF CFI Engine is a light weight multi-fuel ultra low emission, high output two stroke ZERO oil consumption engine.   The ICE development community continues to return to two stroke operating principles such as the SF CFI.   Two strokes offer the greatest promise for high density powerplants," said Corey Dyess, Inventor and Senior Vice President of Research and Development at APT Group, Inc.

This is yet another invitation and engagement directed at APT from expert and leading organizations that are seeking ICE technologies such as the SF CSI engine.  APT Group, Inc. is honored to be selected to participate in this elite symposium.
