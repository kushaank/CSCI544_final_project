
Californian Tech company Aerofex Corp recently announced their plan to launch a personal hoverbike Aero-X in 2017, which shall be made available for everyone. The company claims to be already testing this vehicle, but adds that there’s a lot more room for developments before they let it out for general public. Aero X could revolutionize the concept of personal flight, and if one sits to fantasize, it’s also the most desired mode of transport right now.

The Aero-X will have a positive impact on agriculture, herd management, and geo-surveying – particularly in those parts of the world lacking general aviation. Its intuitive operation, low cost, and unique capabilities make it suitable for disaster relief, search and rescue, and patrolling borders and game parks. We believe it will enable low-altitude utility previously unavailable due to cost and training barriers.

The estimated price of Aero X is US $85,000. The company’s already accepting $5000 refundable deposits on its website, so that interested people may reserve their flight of the future now itself. The first flights are reserved for 2016. The dimensions of the hoverbike are - .5 m (14.8 ft) in length, 2.1 m (6.8 ft) in width and 4.1 feet (1.25 m) in height. Additional features under consideration in Aero X include airbags, flotation pontoons for water operations and transport trailers.
