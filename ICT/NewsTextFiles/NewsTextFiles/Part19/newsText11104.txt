
The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Monday extended its stay order, restraining Shikarpur police from arresting Pakistan Muslim League Functional (PML-F) lawmaker Ghous Bux Mahar in the Shikarpur jirga case. Chief Justice Mabool Baqar, who headed a division bench, put off the hearing of the case till May 26 when Assistant Prosecutor General Muntazir Mehdi requested the court to adjourn the case for enabling him to file comments on the petition.

The suspect, Mahar, has approached the court challenging inclusion of section 310-A of the PPC in the charge-sheet submitted before the Judicial Magistrate of Lakhi Ghulam Shah in the case. Section 310-A called for punishment for giving a female in marriage or otherwise in badla-e-sulh, wanni or sawara in consideration of settling a civil dispute or a criminal liability.

Haider Waheed counsel for Mahar said that the Shikarpur police had inserted the section 310-A in the charge-sheet with malafide intention in order to harass his client, though, no case under 310-A was made out against Mahar. He said that police submitted the charge-sheet before the Judicial Magistrate of Lakhi Ghulam Shah who accepted the same with Section 310-A. He requested the court to declare as illegal the inclusion of Section 310-A in the PML-F lawmaker case, who allegedly supervised the jirga, and 11 others were booked by the Lakhi Ghulam Shah police for holding jirga in Shikarpur.

According to media reports, a jirga held in Wazirabad found some Jagirani tribesmen guilty of having illicit relationships with two girls of the Mahar tribe in a karo-kari (honour killing) case. The jirga, which was held reportedly under the supervision of PML-F lawmaker Ghous Bux Mahar, imposed a fine of Rs 2.4 million on the Jagiranis payable to Mahars.
