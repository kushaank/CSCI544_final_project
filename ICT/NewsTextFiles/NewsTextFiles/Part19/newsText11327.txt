LAS VEGAS — Stationary upholstery house Decor-Rest Furniture will open a permanent showroom in the World Market Center here in time for this summer’s Las Vegas Market, which runs July 27-31.

The 10,000-square-foot showroom in space A-554 is slightly larger than the company’s High Point showroom, said Angelo Marzilli, Jr., executive vice president of the family-owned and operated business. “We will also be showing more of our offerings and it will all be displayed on one floor,” he added.

The company plans to show a cross-section of its casual, condo-sized and urban living collections.

Marzilli said he believes “Made in North America” is becoming more important to furniture retailers, suggesting there are growth opportunities to be had by taking part in the Las Vegas Market.

The model 2344 upholstery suite will be featured in Decor-Rest’s new permanent showroom at the World Market Center, which will open for the summer edition of the Las Vegas Market.
