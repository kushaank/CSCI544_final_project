
Following my appearance on the Daily Show, Iâve received emails and phone calls from people who donât agree with my views about energy and the advantages Americaâs energy abundance providesâbenefits that drive both progress and prosperity.

Some of the emails canât be read in polite company, but one that can asked: âPlease explain how energy from mountain top removal, fracking, and tar sands makes America great.â The word choices Greg selected tell me that he isnât truly seeking enlightenment and is instead aiming to antagonize me. The next day, he sent another: âI have yet to hear back on this simple question. Please respond.â It does seem like a simple question. One I should be able to answer in an instant. But I didnât want to offer platitudes. I felt the question deserved a thoughtful answer. So, Greg, here you are.

Iâve spent the past couple of days at a conference on âEnergy, Economics and Liberty.â There discussions took place on the energy debate, governmentâs role, market solutions, and the geo-politics of energy. About twenty menâall experts in various aspects of energyâattended. I wasnât just the only female I was the only energy advocate. The topics brought Gregâs request to mind and the conversations helped form the answers.

The Energy, Economics and Liberty conference was hosted by the Liberty Fund. On its website , it offers this definition of liberty: âthe beginning and the source of happiness from which all beneficial things flow in return.â Much like liberty, energy is the source from which many beneficial things flow. Energy has been a source of Americaâs freedom, a big part of what has made America great.

Gregâs email to me used terms that lead to three different energy sources: coal, natural gas, and oilâand each have been big contributors to Americaâs progress and prosperity. Each has made the personal lives of Americans more pleasant and less painful. Together these energy sources have made America energy secure.

The email used the term âmountain top removal,â which is a method by which coal can be mined. It is safer than underground mines because it removes the risk of mine accidents, the horror of which weâve recently witnessed in Turkey . (Note: America has far more stringent mining regulations today than does most of the world.) Greg likely selected the term âmountain top removalâ because it sounds harsh. In fact, in the mountainous regions of Eastern Kentucky and West Virginia, this surface mining process allows for hospitals, housing developments, shopping centers to be builtâall which bring more economic development and much needed jobs.

Iâve toured regions where âmountain top removalâ is being done and stood on top of the massive coal seam. The procedure is amazing. Picture the region like lots of upside down ice cream cones next to each other. Hills and valleysâbut no place to create a community. In that mountain is a thick layer of coal that goes all the way through the mountain, north to south, east to west. To access it, the dirt, the tip of the ice cream cone, is taken off and the coal is removed.

In the past, when the coal had been extracted, a private landowner could ask the mining company to level out the landâmaking it economically productive. However, todayâs regulations take away that property ownerâs rights and require that the mountain be rebuilt and put back to its original condition. If the landowner wants to turn his land into a housing development, he then has to incur the expense of, once again, removing the peak and leveling the land.

The coal provides, and has provided, America with low-cost, base-load electricityâwhich, as weâve already addressed, has given us a competitive advantage in the global marketplace and unmatched personal progress. And, therefore, energy from mountain top removal makes America Great.

Frackingâshort for hydraulic fracturingâcombined with the amazing technology of horizontal drilling, has brought America into a new era of energy abundance. Clarkson states: âGas using industries are expanding while we enjoy a distinct advantage over the rest of the world.â He explains: âShale gas lay worthless beneath the earthâs surface for the whole of manâs previous existence until human intelligence made it valuableââand that was done with fracking.

Unlike the pariah Greg presumes fracking to be, it is responsible for the shale gas phenomena.

Last, Greg asked about tar sands and how they make America great. Tar sands, or oil sands, allow America to get oil from our friendly Canadian neighbor and reduce our need to import OPECâs oil. We then refine that oil into gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel that fuels our transportation fleetâsomething that wind and solar power cannot do.

I have been to the oil sands of Canada and what they are doing there is, like fracking and horizontal drilling, a technological miracle.

If you have ever walked on a California beach and stepped on a tar ball (created when the oil seeps out of the ground and is washed ashore mixed with sand), you have a clue what the tar sands are like. The naturally occurring tar sands are a layer in the earth (much like coal). This layer has raw crude oil mixed with the dirt/sands. I recall driving to the tar sands from the town where we stayed. As the elevation increased, I noticed that trees reached a certain height and then died. It was explained that as soon as the roots hit the bitumen (or tar) it kills the tree.

At the extraction site, the tar sands are bulldozed and dumped into giant trucks (much like surface coal mining). The tar and sand mixture is processed to separate the oil and the sand. (Think of taking that tar ball from the beach and boiling it. The oil melts and floats while the sand drops to the bottom.) The oil is now available for use and the clean sand is put back into the earthâonly now the trees can actually grow. The reclaimed land is teeming with wildlife that lives in the healthy forest the extraction process provides. As a result, when the Keystone pipeline is approved, America would be far less dependent on people who aim to do us harm and OPEC couldnât cause an instant recession as it did in 1973. Plus, Keystone will be safer and cheaperânot to mention creating more jobsâthan shipping the oil via rail as we are currently doing.

And that, Greg, is how tar sands can make America greater.
