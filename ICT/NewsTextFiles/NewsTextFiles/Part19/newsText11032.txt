
Paraguayan journalists demonstrated Saturday in front of the Interior Ministry in Asuncion, demanding that the government solve the murder of Fausto Gabriel Alcaraz, the journalist known for his reports on drug trafficking who was gunned down Friday in the city of Pedro Juan Caballero.

The demonstration was called by the Journalists Union of Paraguay, or SPP, whose leaders met with Javier Ibarra, deputy minister of Internal Security at the Interior Ministry.

“We asked him to see to it that the crime against our colleague is cleared up and he told us that the ministry has designated a special team of police to find out what happened,” SPP Secretary Vicente Paez told Efe.

Alcaraz, 28, a journalist at Radio Amambay, was shot in the street by two armed individuals on a motorcycle as the victim was headed back to his home in Pedro Juan Caballero in Amambay province, bordering on Brazil.

The victim was shot 12 times, mostly in the face, according to the autopsy.

Paez confirmed that Alcaraz had made several reports on drug-trafficking rings and their connections with institutions of the province, where last year another journalist was murdered.

“It’s one of the most dangerous places in Paraguay to practice the profession. Organized crime has penetrated the province’s judiciary and legislature,” Paez said.
