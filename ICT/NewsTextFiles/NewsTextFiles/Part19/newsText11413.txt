Cora's Cafe is set to open in the Anderson House Office Building on Monday and will offer breakfast and lunch choices. The cafe and the House Office Building are named after former state Rep. Cora Reynolds Anderson. She served in the House from 1925 to 1926.

The cafe was first announced in February and will offer a food station as well as options such as sandwiches, croissants and salads. It will largely feature products made by Michigan businesses.

The Michigan Bureau of Services for Blind Persons will run the cafe and offer a business training program for blind individuals.
