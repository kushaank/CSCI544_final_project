
Datuk Huan Cheng Guan, Parti Cinta Malaysia’s (PCM) candidate for the Bukit Gelugor by-election, this Monday claimed to solve the problems faced by the traders at the market in Taman Tun Sardon if he wins the election.

During a walkabout this morning where he met up with traders, Huan told that he was informed that some of the problems they faced were minor like roof leakages and minor floods caused by rainfall which could be easily solved. Despite traders paying for their trading licences, which they said had increased by 50%, facilities were yet to be upgraded Huan was informed.  “It’s not a big issue. The problem can be solved and upgrading is not a problem,” he said, adding that he had promised to do the same when he stood for election in the 13th General Election, which he lost. He further added that the nearby flats were in a worse condition and needed help.
