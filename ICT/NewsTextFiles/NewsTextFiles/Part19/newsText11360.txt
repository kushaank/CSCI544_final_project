
The Norwegian Post and Telecommunications Authority’s new report The Norwegian Ecom Market in 2013, positions Get as the fastest growing TV operator and internet service provider in Norway regardless of the technology.

“Companies are always looking to expand their share of the market. We are very pleased to be customers’ first choice when they choose a television and broadband provider. It is a strong vote of confidence from the Norwegian people that we appreciate very much,” said Gunnar Evensen, CEO of Get.

Post and Telecommunications Authority’s report shows that Get is the only company in Norway to increase market share in both broadband and TV markets.

“Last week we were awarded Norway’s best customer service for broadband, and now we are ranked as the fastest growing company within our sector in Norway. It’s very inspiring to see that the work we do is appreciated, and I would like to thank all our employees who do a fantastic job every day providing the best customer experience possible,” added Evensen.
