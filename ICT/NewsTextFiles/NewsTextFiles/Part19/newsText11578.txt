
Mayor Tom Henry has announced the Blue Star Banner Program to recognize Fort Wayne residents and city government employees who are actively deployed with the military. The first service member to be honored is Command Sgt. Maj. Brian Kiess, a member of the Army Reserve who works in the cityâ€™s Division of Public Works. The banner for Kiess will be displayed beginning later this month.

Family and friends of deployed military personnel are encouraged to complete an application at www.cityoffortwayne.org/bluestarbanner . Once the applications are reviewed, banners will be made and displayed on light poles along West Jefferson Boulevard from the Time Corners area to Swinney Park. Banners will be displayed through November, then removed during the winter months before returning in April.
