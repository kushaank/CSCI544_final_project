
Stockholm-based  online payments provider Klarna is accelerating its European rollout  with the acquisition of Germany's market leader Sofort AG, instantly  increasing its market share in greater Europe’s $100 billion e-commerce  market to 10 percent.

"Together we have an incredible opportunity to provide the  most trusted payment solution to our merchants and make it simpler and  safer for consumers to shop online," said Klarna's CEO and co-founder,  Sebastian Siemiatkowski.

The two companies will together form Klarna Group and become Europe’s  leading alternative online payments provider. Their network will cover  43,000 merchants across 14 countries in the region. Between them,  they’ll have 25 million users and partnerships with more than half of  Germany’s online merchants.

Klarna also recently announced it had raised another €90 million from  its investors to finance the acquisition. The fundraising was led by  Klarna’s founders, with participation from existing investors like  Sequoia Capital, General Atlantic and Atomico.

Siemiatkowski said the additional funding is a vote of confidence for  the company's long-term vision to become the world’s favourite way to  buy. The Sofort deal made headlines in business and technology  publications across the globe.

"[Klarna] has become one of the success stories of European  technology and particularly Stockholm start-ups, valued at close to $1bn  in its last fundraising two years ago," the Financial Times wrote.

The New York Times said "Sebastian Siemiatkowski has come a long way  in almost a decade", and that the company is just the latest of a number  of Swedish technology firms with international ambitions.
