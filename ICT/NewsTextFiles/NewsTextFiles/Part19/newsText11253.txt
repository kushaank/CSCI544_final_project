
One of downtownâ€™s most successful home builders has his eye on two new developments downtown and one in Beavercreek.

Charlie Simms , president of Charles Simms Development , said he is looking at two sites for new construction near the riverfront and the ballpark.

Simms has had tremendous success with his condo developments at Patterson Place and Patterson Square, and is looking to add more downtown housing options. He said he wants to see the Water Street apartments begin construction because that will improve the market for his condo product.

More housing is one of the most crucial aspects of the Greater Downtown Dayton Plan, which aims to revitalize downtown and continue to improve it as a regional destination for business and recreation. Increasing the downtown population will support the return of retail to the core.

Simms said a slight dip in home buying activity isnâ€™t curbing his enthusiasm for downtown development.

Simms said the two developments he is looking at would have between 30 and 50 new units each.

Simms also has an 18-acre lot under contract in Beavercreek across the street from Reynolds & Reynolds. He plans to build another community with 80 to 120 units by next spring, but he hasnâ€™t decided what type of housing to build yet.
