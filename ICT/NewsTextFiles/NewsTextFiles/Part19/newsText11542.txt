
Sepialine’s Argos OnBoard for Kyocera keeps printing costs under control.

Sepialine today announced Argos OnBoard for Kyocera, a print management and tracking application that supports HyPAS-enabled Multifunction Products (MFPs) from KYOCERA Document Solutions America, one of the world’s leading document solutions companies.

Argos OnBoard for Kyocera is part of the Argos Print Management solution, which tracks and controls print and copy activity on a wide variety of printers. It also provides user authentication and print, copy and scan tracking to any HyPAS-enabled and HyPAS-capable Kyocera MFP.

To access an Argos-enabled Kyocera MFP, users enter a PIN code on the MFP panel, or swipe a proximity card/badge. Login information is stored centrally in Argos and can be integrated with many user authentication and accounting systems, including Microsoft Active Directory and Oracle.

By tracking every print, copy and scan made on Kyocera MFPs, Argos gives administrators a better understanding of how printing equipment is used, identifies possible areas of abuse and provides analysis into user print behavior.

For legal, architectural, engineering and other professional services firms which pass print costs onto their clients, Argos can require users to enter project or client billing information after every print, copy and/or scan. Argos Round Trip accounting integration keeps an active list of billing codes at the user’s fingertips, and sends monthly billing data back to the accounting system for automatic invoicing.
