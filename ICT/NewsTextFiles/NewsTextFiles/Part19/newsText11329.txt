
Aereo, which uses antennas to allow subscribers to view live broadcast television over the Internet, is in the midst of a Supreme Court battle with TV networks.

Because Aereo does not pay a fee for its content it is able to charge just $10 per month for its services. The court will be asked to determine whether Aereo should have to pay a content fee.

ABC, NBC, CBS and 21st Century Fox are alleging that Aereo has taken advantage of a legal loophole. Aereo contends that the use of antennas is within its rights.

“We would be the first and only company” required to pay copyright fees, says Kanojia. “I would be happy to pay the broadcast fees if they came up with a rule” that subjected the networks to the same obligations.

Aereo, whose investors include Barry Diller’s IAC, FirstMark Capital, and Highland Capital Partners, launched in February 2012. It is headquartered in Long Island City, New York.

FOX Business is owned by 21st Century Fox.
