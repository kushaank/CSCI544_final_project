The fabric hurricane panels are definitely better than steel or aluminum panels since they are flexible, durable, and highly resistant to the effects of hurricanes. These panels are made from PVC coated woven fabric and hence, they are highly beneficial in blocking wind, storm-driven projectiles and rain. Moreover, the fabric hurricane panels are extremely easy to handle and install. Professionals at StormFitters have years of experience in installing these panels.
