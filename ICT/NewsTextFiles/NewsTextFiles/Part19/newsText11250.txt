
HOUSTON (AP) - Texas Gov. Rick Perry has written a letter to President Barack Obama slamming his energy policies, EPA regulations and a lack of movement on whether to build a cross-border pipeline to carry crude oil from Canada to Gulf Coast refineries.

The letter is dated Friday. It largely reiterates much of Perry's long-standing opposition to the Obama administration's energy policies.

But it comes as a bipartisan energy bill stalled in Congress when GOP Senators demanded a vote on the Keystone XL Canada-to-Texas pipeline and on the EPA's move to put greenhouse gas regulations on existing coal-fired power plants.

Perry's letter touts Texas' economy and what he called the state's success at having both a robust energy industry and sound environmental regulations.

Perry is considered a possible presidential contender in 2016.
