
Itâ€™s happening now in Arizona â€” at least, for some policyholders.

The Arizona Department of Insurance is allowing insurers to decide whether they will allow people to keep their policies. Insurers have the option to renew plans that otherwise would have been canceled under the Affordable Care Act.

Policyholders affected are those who purchased plans between March 24, 2010, when the ACA was enacted, and Dec. 31, 2013. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona will give its enrollees the option to keep their plans intact.

When the ACA was enacted, any insurance plans purchased before that date were considered grandfathered. Other health plans purchased after that needed to be in compliance with the ACA, with richer benefits, but also could be more expensive.

Many Americans who purchased plans between March 23, 2010, and Dec. 31, 2013, thought they could keep their health plans â€” because Obama told them they could.

It was a mess last year when policy- holders across the state and nation were left with canceled health plans.

â€œIt really is a customer-friendly decision made by the DOI with the support of the governor,â€� Stelnik said.

The state insurance department is not forcing insurance companies to decide one way or the other, leaving the decision in the hands of the carriers. Henry GrosJean , a small-business insurance broker, said this solution may be temporary. â€œItâ€™s naturally a good thing that they can keep their current plans, irrespective of what the ACA holds for them at their new renewal date, where changes to their plans or premiums will see more reality,â€� he said.

Iâ€™m still waiting to hear what other insurers plan to do.
