
Coal India Limited (CIL) chairman and managing director S Narsing Rao is rumoured to be quitting his post to work in the new state of Telangana. He is likely to head the chief minister’s office as principal secretary.

Rao hails from Medak, the home district of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) president K Chandrasekhara Rao (KCR) who is all set to become the chief minister early next month following the formation of the two states.

Local media channels flashed a report stating KCR met the Governor accompanied by Narsing Rao on the issue of cadre allocation. Phone calls made to Narsing Rao’s mobile went unanswered.

A 1986-batch IAS officer, Narsing Rao belongs to the Andhra Pradesh cadre and is expected to be allocated to Telangana when the All India Services officers are divided between the two states before the appointed day on June 2. He took over as Coal India CMD in April, 2012, emerging successfully amid a stiff competition for the job. He was appointed with a five-year tenure.

Before joining Coal India, Rao worked as CMD of Singareni Collieries owned by state and central governments with 51 and 49 per cent holding respectively.
