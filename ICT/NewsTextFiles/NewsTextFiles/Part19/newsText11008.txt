"Brazil was the main buyer of fresh fruits, with $60.6 million, 25.2% of the total," they said.

As for production, the IES recalled that after falling 1% in the 2012/13 campaign, fruit production in the 2013/14 cycle would decline by nearly 20%, as the harvest of the main fruits would total 3.6 million tonnes in the current year. "The production of the major fruits (pears, apples, limes, oranges, tangerines and grapefruit), which representing 90% of the total will decline for the third year in a row. Total fruit production for 2014 would decrease by 21.2% when compared to the previous cycle, due to the fall in the harvest of peaches and plums," it noted.
