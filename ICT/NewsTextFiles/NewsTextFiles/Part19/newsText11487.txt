
Potomac Point Winery is proud to announce the addition of David Pagan Castaño as head winemaker.  David is a third generation winemaker from Yecla, Spain beginning with his grandfather who founded what is now Bodegas Castaño, one of Southeast Spain’s premier wineries.  After obtaining his Master’s degree in Oenology and Viticulture from Polytechnic University of Valencia, Spain with post-graduate Master classes at the prestigious Ecole Superieure d’Agriculture d’Angers & De Toulouse, France; David officially began his career in winemaking at his family’s winery, Bodegas Castaño.  His experience with his family’s 1,000 acre vineyard and winery instilled a deep appreciation for quality fruit and family values.  “I come from a family of winemakers and vine growers, and in my family every celebration or family gathering happens at the winery with lots of food and wine.  Wine and family are inextricably intertwined.  I am so grateful to Virginia for giving me so much; my wife is from here, my son was born here...my own little family.  The way I give back, naturally, is through wine” says David.

PPW owners, Skip and Cindi Causey, had the pleasure of initially meeting David and his wife, Nicole, during David’s 30th Birthday celebration at Potomac Point.  They look forward to celebrating many more birthdays and milestones with David and his family.  Cindi feels that “our Potomac Point family along with David’s is a perfect blend”.

David’s experience in Cotes-du-Rhone, France; Mallorca, Spain; Sonoma, California; Marlborough, New Zealand; and most recently Loudoun County, Virginia has helped to shape his wine making style and vineyard expertise.  Throughout his career, David has worked with over 40 different grape varietals and over the past five years he has won more than a dozen gold and platinum international awards for his wines.  We feel David’s life experiences have instilled a deep appreciation in him for sharing his love of what he does best, winemaking.
