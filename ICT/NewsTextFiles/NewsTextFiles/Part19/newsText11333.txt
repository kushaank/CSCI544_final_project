
ARCTIC Circle Air will be resuming flight and cargo operations by the end of the month.

Arctic Circle Air clarified that its plane is in the Philippines for a bi-annual inspection and for various upgrades.

“[The] aircraft is expected to return to Saipan by the end of the month and resume passenger and cargo service,” Arctic Circle Air said.

Arctic Circle Air suspended its operations in the islands last month.

Arctic Circle began operating in 2012 following the acquisition of the nine-seat Britten Norman BN-2T aircraft from the U.K. which underwent recertification from the Federal Aviation Administration in Alaska before it was flown to Saipan.

Arctic Circle Air was the brainchild of businessman Tony Pellegrino who wanted to revive the islands’ agricultural economy and transport the islands’ produce between the islands and elsewhere in the region.

It was acquired by JMSH LLC, owner of Rota Resort, last year.

JMSH LLC was previously planning to buy more planes so they could provide air and cargo service to more people.

Arctic Circle Air had been providing charter service to Tinian and Rota.

Earlier, the airline was also looking at delivering mail across the islands to pick up the slack.

Back in January 2013, JMSH LLC announced its intention to acquire Arctic Circle Air and it was planning to invest $70 million to purchase up to 10 planes.

It was looking into acquiring a Y-12 aircraft from China that costs between $5 million and $7 million each.

A Harbin Y-12 aircraft is a high wing, twin-engine turboprop utility aircraft with a maximum payload of 12,600 lbs and can seat 17 passengers and two crew members.
