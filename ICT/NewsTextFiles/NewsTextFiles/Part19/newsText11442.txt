
CAIRO May 19 (Reuters) - Egypt's central bank allowed the Egyptian pound to weaken further at a dollar sale on Monday, after the currency hit an all-time low in the official market last week.

Sustained dollar shortages have fuelled a thriving black market in Egypt as political turmoil following the 2011 uprising against Hosni Mubarak has unnerved foreign investors and tourists, traditionally major sources of foreign currency.

The central bank said it sold $37.6 million at a cut-off price of 7.1068 pounds, weaker than the rate of 7.1026 pounds at its last sale on Thursday. It had offered $40 million.

Forex traders and economists have described the central bank's decision to allow the pound to gradually weaken as a managed depreciation.

Some have suggested is it is aimed at giving the government "breathing room" if a presidential election due on May 26-27, which former army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is expected to easily win, triggers more violence.

The rates at which banks are allowed to trade dollars  are determined by the results of the central bank sales, giving the bank effective control over official exchange rates.

One black market trader put Monday's rates at 7.53/55, unchanged from a day earlier. The pound had strengthened temporarily on the black market after an exceptional central bank forex auction on Wednesday provided the official market with $1.1 billion.

After the exceptional auction, black market traders offered dollars for around 7.46/50.
