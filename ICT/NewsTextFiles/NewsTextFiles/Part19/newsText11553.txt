That is the title of his new book, which discusses the role that community and attitude play in regard to launching a successful business or any endeavor in life.

In the book, he discusses how important it is that the customer gets a positive first impression of an establishment in order to guarantee repeat business and glowing reviews to family and friends through conversation and social media. He also discusses how this same positive attitude, along with educating clients/customers while networking, can help build healthy congregations in synagogues and churches.

�I can�t begin to tell you how many times I have gone to a restaurant, business, or place of worship and not having been greeted by anyone,� Lanzkron-Tamarazo said. �The first thing I think is, �does this establishment want me here or not?� That first contact with a potential customer or client has to be friendly, warm, and sincere, or face the consequences of having them not return. The key to launching and building a successful business is establishing long lasting relationships, and that starts with the first impression, whether it�s a simple hello from the owner or an employee.

Aromas abound at Chazzano Coffee Roasters ( chazzanocoffee.com ), 1737 E. Nine Mile Road, because coffee is roasted inside the small caf�, which opened in 2006.
