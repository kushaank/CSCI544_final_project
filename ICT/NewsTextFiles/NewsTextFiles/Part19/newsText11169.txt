Legislation proposed in North Carolina would open the door for exploratory shale gas drilling this spring and add protections for the environment and residents, according to the newsobserver.com. The legislation would also allow energy exploration companies to exempt from public disclosure a list of chemicals used in fracking.

The state geologist, under confidentiality provisions, would know the fracking chemicals used. The list of materials would be released to first responders and medical personnel in the event of an emergency, the Observer reported.

Fracking has emerged as a controversial issue in St. Tammany Parish . Helis Oil & Gas Co. of New Orleans wants to drill a well on an undeveloped tract of land northeast of Mandeville and use the fracking process to extract oil. The proposal has drawn heavy opposition from some citizens and environmental groups who fear damage to the area's drinking water, among other concerns.
