
Kenya: He was raised in a Christian home and credits this with teaching him the value of patience, a virtue that has proved indispensable in his entrepreneurial journey.

Mr Obadiah Maina, 35, has risen from the turbulence of abject poverty in Mathira, Nyeri County, to set up a financial institution.

Three years ago, the idea of owning a savings and credit co-operative (Sacco) was not even in his wildest dreams.

Then, Mr Maina was an instructor at a Nairobi-based IT college, and got paid just enough to get by.

To supplement his income, he started selling vegetables. His side business did surprisingly well, and he was soon able to buy a pickup to ease the transport of groceries.

He decided to research what it would take to open a Sacco. He wanted to enable people pool their money and lend it on to individuals in need of affordable credit.

Further, from his experience as a grocer, he knew micro and small enterprises find it difficult or too costly to borrow money from mainstream financial institutions, so he felt sure there would be a market for his services.

To reflect his business’ aspirational nature, he named it Good Life Sacco. He spread the word about his company, and within six months, had 30 members. He decided to quit his job.

“I wanted to give my Sacco my full attention to see it grow to a fully fledged bank in a few years’ time, even as we opened more branches across the country,” Maina said.
