
Kentucky House Bill 5, which was signed by Gov. Steve Beshear in April, is a data privacy bill that imposes data-security requirements, investigation requirements and breach notification requirements on governmental agencies and â€œnonaffiliated third partiesâ€� that do business with governmental agencies.

The law is set to go into effect Jan. 1.

The law applies to businesses working with governmental agencies. But Lisa Underwood , partner and leader of the data privacy and security team with Wyatt Tarrant & Combs LLP's Lexington office, said it could affect more businesses than people might realize at first glance.

She explained the law applies to agencies that work with governments within the state. For example, the law could  extend a private high school that sends personal information for a scholarship through a state program if the school has a contract with the state and if it receives personal information from the state.

"If a private entity does business with a governmental agency â€¦ if you receive information back from that governmental entity that is personal information, then you are under this House Bill 5," Underwood said.

The cost for businesses to comply with the law is unknown, Underwood said, because it will depend on what kind of security measures the business already has in place.

Security procedures are required to be in writing.

Security measures need to be in compliance with the state office with which the third party has the contract.

If the nonaffiliated third party enters into a new contract after Jan. 1, then the agreement must include language requiring the nonaffiliated third party to implement, maintain and update a certain level of security and breach investigation procedures, and it must specify how the cost of any required notification and investigation are to be apportioned.
