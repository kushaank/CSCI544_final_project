
MINISTER OF Education Ronald Jones welcomes any independent scientific study into the cancer-related deaths of people connected to the Louis Lynch Secondary School.

However, he said it was “passing strange” the illnesses appeared so isolated.

“One should also take a look at the community that surrounds it because it is passing strange that only people within the space occupied by Louis Lynch would have all of these things being spoken about, but somebody three metres below or just cross the road – a whole community – [are not]. Something is not on all fours,” he said, suggesting this was something THE NATION could look into.

Jones was referring to a story carried on the front page of yesterday’s SUNDAY SUN, which said that more than 20 former students had died from various cancers and at least nine former teachers had either been diagnosed with cancer or were suffering from acute respiratory illnesses.
