
In case of private companies, there was absolute liberty as to the manner of appointment of directors. The articles could have named all directors, or the articles could have laid the manner of appointment of directors.

In case of public companies, at least two third of the total number had to be those appointed by general meetings. That is, public companies had the right to self-regulate appointment of one third of the total board strength.

The board could, subject to articles, appoint additional directors. These were pro-tem directors â€“ they will lay down their office at the AGM and may be regularised there.

The board could also appoint alternate directors.
