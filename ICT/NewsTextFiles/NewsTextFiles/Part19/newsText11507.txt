The servers at Bottoms Up in Clovis are friendly as ever, but just a touch more modest.

The servers at Bottoms Up in Clovis are friendly as ever, but just a touch more modest. Little sweaters cover their bikini tops and the bottoms are well, less than you'd see at the beach. Drink names implying sexual acts are off the menu.

"So we just pretty much put stickers over the ones that were bad, and we changed the whole menu to where the names are a little safer and everyone is a lot happier," manager Kristyn Wool explained.

Candice Eslick, the chief critic who led a petition drive to protest the place, is pleased.

"I'm happy for something being done, it shows what a community can do to change things that they don't think are acceptable," she said.

The city of Clovis looked at the operation and found no violations of the law. But Council Member Nathan Magsig is glad the company settled the matter.

"I'm very pleased that the owner of this particular coffee shop has listened of course to the neighbors," he said.

Wool says business is brisk at Bottoms Up thanks in some part to this controversy.

"Business is doing great; we got a lot of advertisement from it, got a lot of business from it, so we are kind of thankful for that part. But the negative, we're glad that we're clearing that up right away," she said.
