
Holland, Mich.

In the past 2� years, Mark Kinsler has trotted the globe as Michigan Economic Development Corporation�s vice president for international business development. He accompanied Gov. Rick Snyder and Lt. Gov. Brian Calley on trade missions to The Netherlands and China, and made business trips to Israel, Italy, Germany and Canada.

He�s going to stick closer to home beginning next month.

Kinsler has been appointed chief operating officer of Trendway Corporation, a Holland-based office furniture manufacturer, he told The Sentinel. He starts his new job June 2.

�It�s a good time for me to make this move,� Kinsler said. �I�ve traveled around the world over the course of the last 2� years. I�ve learned a lot. I was brought in (by the MEDC) to help them build their global outreach. I went to Europe. I was overseas 11 times in those 2� years, including five trips to China.

Kinsler spent 25 years at Zeeland-based office furniture manufacturer Herman Miller, where he started in sales and moved into management roles as senior vice president of strategic account management and senior vice president of North American sales at the company.

At Herman Miller, Bundy served as a senior vice president and SQA Division senior manager.

The chance to reunite with Bundy and help oversee Trendway was a perfect fit for him, Kinsler said.

�This position gives me an opportunity to do more of a general manager�s role than what I�ve done in the past,� he said. �I�ve got a really good relationship with Bill. They recruited me. In the past couple of months, he reached out again. It was really attractive to me.

The optimistic outlook in the office furniture industry, as well as the rebounding economic conditions in Michigan and nationally, prompted Kinsler to make the career move.
