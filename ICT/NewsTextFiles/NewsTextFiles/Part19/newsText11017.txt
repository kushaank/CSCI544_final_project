EXCEPTIONAL:  Tighes Hill TAFE Refrigeration Department head teacher Geoff McDonald, Jay Riddett and Garry Clements.

Jay Riddett, a refrigeration apprentice from Clements Air Conditioning, Refrigeration and Electrical at Rutherford, recently took out first prize at the World Skills regional competition and will now represent the Hunter at the National Refrigeration Competition in Melbourne.

World Skills International Competition.

Clements service supervisor Mark Anderson said he was thrilled for his young apprentice.

“He’s just a very ­well-adjusted, nice young man, a gem to have around the place.

Competitors undergo a work skills trade test and complete tasks set for them in a certain time limit that relate to their industry.

Mr Anderson said he was impressed at the level of commitment Mr Riddett had shown.

“It’s a huge commitment for a young bloke, to basically give up his life for six or 12 months just to get to the regional competition,” he said.

“Jay works here his normal hours and then two or three nights a week he attends TAFE after hours, where the teachers very generously give up their time to train him to help him compete.

The competition started in Melbourne on Friday and will continue throughout this week.
