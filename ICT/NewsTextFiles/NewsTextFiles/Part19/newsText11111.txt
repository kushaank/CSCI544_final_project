When asked, if tanks will be manufactured in Latvia, Saciks said: "Are you kidding? Of course, we do not plan to do that. We have a decent civil project. In reality, Latvia has never manufactured freight cars. And now it is a pilot-project for Latvia as a country, which will now own its own industry it did not have before."
