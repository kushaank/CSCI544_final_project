Europe's solar industry is weighing whether to build a massive solar-panel factory to better compete with China, German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported Tuesday. Research institutes are leading a consortium that is sounding out the idea, the newspaper said, citing unidentified sources. The plant would employ 1,200 workers and have annual capacity of a gigawatt, the newspaper said. It would cost around EUR1 billion.

But the newspaper said it was an open question whether the plans would be fulfilled.

While many solar companies back the plan, a major one, SolarWorld, rejected the plan, citing large risks for investors and the sector itself, the newspaper reported.
