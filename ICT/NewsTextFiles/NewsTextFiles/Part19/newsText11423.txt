
A deal that paves the way for a Sonic Drive-In to be built in downtown Wichita closed as expected Friday.

I reported then that a land deal for Sonic to purchase the property at 504 S. Broadway was imminent.

Patrick Lenow , a Sonic spokesman, tells me the company plans to use a local contractor to build the restaurant. Sonic has a select list of contractors it will consider proposals from.

Lenow says bids are due this week, and the contract is expected to be awarded in the next couple weeks.

Wilkus Architects of Eden Prairie, N.M. is Sonicâ€™s national architect of record.

Once construction starts, work is typically completed in 90 to 120 days, Lenow says.

Oklahoma City-based Sonic plans to build a 1,800-square-foot restaurant on the South Broadway site, which is near the southeast corner of the intersection of Broadway and Lewis.

The property, which until recently housed Golden House Chinese Restaurant, will be razed to make room for the Sonic.
