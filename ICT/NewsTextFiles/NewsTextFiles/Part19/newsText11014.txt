
It is reported that integra has laid off 500 workers from the Glennies Creek underground and Camberwell open cut mines near Singleton in the NSW Hunter Valley, blaming coal prices.

Employees said that although operations would be shut down, facilities would be maintained.

Integra, which is part of Brazilian mining giant Vale, has blamed poor coal prices for its decision.

Mr Peter Jordan of the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union said that the news comes as a shock and will have a big economic impact.

Mr Jordan said that "We're talking all up about 500 jobs there, so that's going to have a massive impact on the Singleton and surrounding towns where most of those workers and their families live."

He said that "I'd like to think that this is not going to happen but we're hearing that this might be an arrangement to shut down the mines temporarily and restart it under some operation."

He added that the 500 workers face an uncertain future.

He further added that "I'd like to think that this is not going to happen but we're hearing that this just might be an arrangement to shut down mine temporarily and restart it under some other arrangement."
