
In excess of 50 MEPs have promised they will put fire safety first if they are elected in this week's (May 22nd) elections.

Such aÂ campaign was launched in January. It beckons Members and candidate Members of the European Parliament to collaborate with firefighters on the frontline and those in the building industry, to enhance fire safety standards and practices in different premises. These include homes, shops, hospitals and schools - places where Europeans tend to spend their time.

"We want buildings that make us comfortable, that keep us safe from intruders, and that use less energy," she said.

"It is essential for us to take action to improve fire safety in Europe, and all citizens should be equally protected," she stated.

Commercial buildings, non-domestic and multi-occupancy premises in England and Wales are already forced to undertake a 'suitable and sufficient' fire risk assessment carried out under the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005.

While the overwhelming majority of premises do this, if the assessment is thought to have been carried out to an insufficient extent, the Responsible Person can face an unlimited fine or up to two years in prison.
