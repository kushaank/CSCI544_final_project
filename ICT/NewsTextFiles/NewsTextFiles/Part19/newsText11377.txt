The provisions at issue are intended to protect employees from retaliation by their employers for bringing to OSHA’s attention potential violations by the employers of the OSH Act.  These whistleblower provisions have not been updated since the law was passed in 1970, and OSHA is now seeking to strengthen them.

Expanding the current 30-day statute of limitations to 180 days, so that it is the same as other more recently passed laws, such as the Dodd-Frank amendments to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  Michaels explained that OSHA cannot address more than 200 OSH Act whistleblower allegations annually because employees do learn of the employer’s retaliatory motive until more than 30 days after the adverse employment action.

Authorizing OSHA to order the “immediate preliminary reinstatement” of employees whom the agency believes have been wrongly discharged for reporting possible safety issues.

Including “individual right of action” provisions that would allow whistleblowers to pursue actions in directly in federal court after a certain length of time if the agency has not acted, as permitted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

It remains to be seen whether Congress will act on Michaels’ proposals, and what concrete recommendations the advisory committee develops.  As always, any important developments will be reported here on this blog.
