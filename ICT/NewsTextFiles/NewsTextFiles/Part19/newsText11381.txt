[Twitch] has not only become the leading player in ‘game broadcasting’ but also one of the largest providers of online streaming video. More than 45mn users each month use Twitch to broadcast, watch and chat about gaming (e.g., League of Legends, Minecraft, etc.). Twitch is also a video platform that is used by publishers, developers and others (e.g., Sony’s PS4 and Microsoft’s XBOX) to incorporate community and interactivity into their services [...] We do not have financial data on the business, but do have a few operating metrics – which are impressive: 1) reached 45 million unique viewers per month in 2013, up from 20 million the year prior and 3mn in 2011 (#1 video site in comScore’s gaming category); 2) delivered viewing-minutes doubled in 2013 to 12 billion per month (or ~106 minutes per user per month); 3) has more than 900,000 broadcasters of gaming content, along with 5,100 professional content and other developer partners; and 4) Internet broadband data provider Sandvine’s 1H14 report cited that Twitch.TV has emerged as a ‘top-ranked applications in many regions across the globe’ and that ‘the service now generates more traffic than HBO GO in the US’ (or 1.35% share of all broadband application streaming).

Google shares today are up $8.76, or 1.7%, at $537.06.
