
(MENAFN - Muscat Daily) The Mining and Quarrying Oman 2014 conference, which started at the Crowne Plaza Muscat on Sunday, highlighted that the key factors for the future growth of the metals and minerals industry in Oman were developing the export market through the sultanate's ports and freeÂ zones and generating a successful investment environment.

Speaking at the event, Edwin Lammers, executive commercial director, Sohar Port and Freezone, commented on the contribution of the economic zone, saying, ''Sohar Port and Freezone has developed into the nerve centre of an industrial and economic powerhouse. Without doubt the past couple of years have been successful, with growth of 52 per cent in 2012 and further growth in 2013.''

''The highpoint was the achievement of an aggregate cargo throughput of nearly 50mn tons, in just 11 years from start-up. Our ongoing goal is to leverage Sohar's geographical location, world-class deepwater harbour facilities and excellent infrastructure facilities to provide investors with a robust manufacturing and export platform to achieve global competitive advantages, cost efficiencies and access to new markets,'' he added.

At an interactive panel discussion on 'Maximising the potential of an export market for Oman's metals and minerals industry' at the event, Lammers was joined by Eng Hashim Taher al Ibrahim, deputy director of the commercial department at the Port of Duqm, and Mohammed Amer al Mashani, commercial manager for general cargo at the Port of Salalah.

The panel discussed the potential export opportunities and value addition by the metals and minerals industry and reviewed the challenges faced by exporters.
