Decision Inc will be showcasing its business intelligence (BI) technologies at the 36th annual SAPICS Conference and Exhibition for supply chain professionals taking place from 1 to 3 June at Sun City.

The company will use the event, considered to be the most influential of its kind on the continent, to illustrate how it uses best-of-breed technologies combined with supply chain knowledge and business experience to enable effective, rapid decision making.

"It is expected that more than 1 000 supply chain professionals will attend SAPICS this year. As a BI provider with extensive supply chain experience and a number of logistics clients, Decision Inc is excited about the potential that demonstrating our solutions to such an influential audience will have for our brand," says Nick Bell, CEO of Decision Inc.

While the conference is geared to providing delegates with valuable knowledge sharing sessions, the exhibition will feature more than 50 different companies sharing insights and demonstrations of progressive technology and supply chain best practices and solutions.

"When we formed Decision Inc, our vision was to add real value to clients by providing business and process knowledge and leveraging the power of information through robust data and "best-of-breed" platform technologies. This event gives us an opportunity to discuss with executives how they can realise real value from their investment in decision support technology. We will demonstrate that the provision of technical and relevant business knowledge across the BI value chain will help them make better decisions, faster," says Bell.

Decision Inc was launched earlier this year following the merger between ASYST Intelligence, BusinessIntelligent, and the Microsoft division of DigiQuill,

Although predominantly in South Africa, Decision Inc services clients in Botswana, Namibia, Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Ghana, and Zambia.

"Our combination of business and technical competence helps business gain critical insight from their data," said Bell.

We look forward to interacting with SAPICS delegates to show them how this technology can assist in improving their supply chain processes and business efficiencies."
