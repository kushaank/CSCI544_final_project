
The Yellowknife Food Bank is looking for ways to help fund its very first rent payment, after moving locations on Saturday.

The organization used to be in the basement of Overlanders Sport, where it didn't pay any rent . But the shop has decided to expand its store into the basement, so the food bank had to find a new home.

But the change does come at a cost for the organization. Pryznyk expects to pay $1,500 per month for rent and electricity at the food bank's new location at 6 Coronation Dr. in the Kam Lake Industrial Park, a cost he didn't have before now.

"So we're going to have to kick it up a notch and start some fundraising program to make up that difference now," Prynyk said."

"The community has been great for us in the past, and we hope that they'll be able to step up and help us with this one too."

Pryznyk thinks the new location is ideal for clients because it has "street-level access, not too far off the beaten trail."

"Hopefully we can serve our clients better," he said.
