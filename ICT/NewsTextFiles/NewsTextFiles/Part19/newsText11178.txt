
[ClickPress, Mon May 19 2014] The Slovenian life insurance segment declined at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of -1.8% during the review period (2008-2012). This was primarily due to the banking crisis which, by the end of 2012, resulted in recession for Slovenia. However, increased investment in fixed capital creation and a recovery in private consumption managed to bring Slovenia out of recession by the end of 2013. Over the forecast period (2012-2017), the life insurance segment is projected to post a CAGR of 4.2% as the demand for traditional life insurance products, such as term life and annuities, is expected to grow. In addition, the new pension law and the amendments made to the prevalent insurance law in 2013 are further expected to support the segment's growth.
