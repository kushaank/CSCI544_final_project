The only way to be sure meat is cooked to kill all harmful bacteria is to use a thermometer to measure the internal temperature.

These temperatures are sufficient: ground beef 160 degrees; fish 145 degrees; beef, pork and lamb chops/steaks/roasts 145 degrees with a three-minute rest time; poultry 165 degrees, and hot dogs 160°F or steaming hot.

To further reduce the risk of foodborne illness, the USDA offers these tips.

■ Wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw meat and poultry.

■ Wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot, soapy water. Immediately clean up spills.

■ Keep raw meat, including fish and poultry, away from food that will not be cooked.

■ Use separate cutting boards for raw meat and cooked foods.

■ Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase or one hour if temperatures exceed 90º F. Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.

The recall of 1.8 million pounds of ground beef products from a Detroit-based business had public health officials once again reminding the public of the dangers of undercooked meat.

The beef products tainted with E. coli O157:H7  the source of at least 11 illnesses across four states including three hospitalizations  were traced to Wolverine Packing, according to the U.S. Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service .

They were produced between March 31 and April 18 and shipped to distributors for restaurant use throughout Michigan and into Ohio, Massachusetts and Missouri, federal officials said.

Officials with Wolverine Packing issued a statement through a public relations firm.

Company officials did not respond to calls for further comment.

Illness from E. coli O157:H7  a particular strain that releases toxins  can be miserable, with severe abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhea and vomiting.

If its not controlled, it kills young children and the elderly, said Evangelyn Alocilja, a Michigan State University researcher who has helped develop sensors to rapidly detect and identify infectious agents.

In fact, it has been estimated that just 23 of the bacteria  invisible to the naked eye even if they were clumped together  can kill a human. In contrast, it takes 1,000 or more of a salmonella to do the same damage, she said.

Other kinds of E. coli  those that do not release toxins  are not as harmful.

The bacteria enters the food supply through animal feces, and an infected human who prepares food can then pass it on to others, she said.

In the latest case, all of the people who got sick were expected to fully recover, state health officials have said .

Federal officials were alerted May 12 and have been working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health officials. Federal staff will spot-check restaurants to make sure that any meat that could possibly be contaminated is removed so that it wont be served to consumers, a spokeswoman for the USDA said.

She said the USDA does not release a list of restaurants where the meat might have been shipped.

The meat would have passed its expiration date, but there is a concern that some of it might have been frozen, said Jennifer Holton, spokeswoman with the Michigan Department of Agriculture & Rural Development.

Its hopeful that we wont see any more cases, Horton said.

Most people recover from E. coli O157:H7 in five to seven days. In the three-year period ending last year, 689 cases of E. coli sickness  including outbreaks traced to raw clover sprouts and frozen foods  were reported to the Michigan Department of Community Health.

The ground beef was produced between March 31 and April 18 and shipped to distributors for restaurant use throughout Michigan and into Ohio, Massachusetts and Missouri, federal officials said.
