
Southwest will begin nonstop routes from BWI to Dallas in October.

Southwest Airlines Co. will begin three daily roundtrip flights from Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport to Dallas Love Field starting Oct. 13.

The flights come as the 35-year-old Wright Amendment expires in October . The law was put in place to limit nonstop flights out of Love Field to mostly adjoining states, putting the majority of U.S. destinations out of reach without making connection flights. It was intended to strengthen Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport as the regionâ€™s main airport.

As part of the move, Southwest is also adding nonstop service from Washington Reagan National to Dallas.

Meantime, Dallas-based Southwest (NYSE: LUV) will start BWI-to-Punta Canta routes starting Nov. 2. Southwest will take over the flights from AirTran Airways, which it acquired in 2011.

Southwest said Monday it expects to fully integrate AirTran into the company by the end of 2014. On Dec. 28, Southwest will operate the last AirTran flight, set for Atlanta to Tampa. The flight was AirTran's first route on Oct. 26, 1993.

Southwest is the largest carrier at BWI with a nearly 70 percent market share.

Southwest will also takeover AirTran's international flights from BWI to Aruba, the Bahamas and Montego Bay, Jamaica.

Southwest will also assume AirTran's BWI-to-Cancun international service on Aug. 10.
