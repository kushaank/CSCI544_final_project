
LEBANON, Maine – According to Pastor Mark Kraines,the First Parish Congregational Church of Lebanon, Maine was founded in 1765 and has been helping people of the area since then.

The First Parish Congregational Food Pantry was created and became allied with The Good Shepherd Food Bank, an organization that has offices throughout the state of Maine.

“We work in conjunction with The Good Shepherd Food Bank out of Biddeford,” explained Lorrie Lovely a Deacon of the Church and Sunday School Supervisor as well as one of the parishioners involved with the Food Bank.

“Almost all the members of the parish are involved in some manner, but this is our first Open House,” she said, as she pointed to several people dining on soup and bread as part of the day's fund raiser.

“The Good Shepherd people gave us a fund-raising challenge that if we came up with $300, they would match it. That is why we are here today working toward that goal.

Foodstuffs for the Church Food Bank are also dropped off at the Lebanon Post Office.

One of the parishioners who have given assistance to the pantry in the past and present is Abigail Kraines, daughter of Pastor Mark.  Abigail, 18, is a senior at Spaulding High School in Rochester and bound for Northeastern University next year.
