
The Teluk Intan by-election will see a straight fight between Gerakan president Datuk Mah Siew Keong and the DAP’s political greenhorn, Dyana Sofya Mohd Daud.

Both were the only candidates to file papers at the close of nomination today for the by-election on May 31.

The by-election will provide Mah and his party an opportunity to revive its fortunes which took a bashing at the last general election, while the DAP hopes that by fielding Dyana (pic), it will be able to change perception that it is a Chinese-centric party and boost the number of Malay MPs among its ranks.

To date, the DAP has two Malay MPs &ndash; Bukit Bendera's Zairil Khir Johari and Raub's Datuk Ariff Sabri &ndash; both of whom lead Chinese-majority seats.

Mah, the former deputy minister for Agriculture and Agro-based Industry, was the Teluk Intan MP until 2008, having won the seat in the 1999 and 2004 general elections. In 2008, he lost to DAP's M. Manogaran, and to the late Seah Leong Peng in 2013, who also managed to garner25% of the 23,000 Malay votes.

The by-election in Teluk Intan was triggered by Seah’s death due to cancer on May 1.

The 53-year-old Mah (pic, right) graduated from the London School of Economics and has a law degree from the University of East London, while the 27-year-old lawyer Dyana is the political secretary to Lim Kit Siang and will be the party’s first Malay DAP woman MP if elected.

The seat has 23,301 Malay voters (38.6%), 25,310 Chinese voters (41.9%) and 11,468 Indian voters A total of 60,349 registered voters consisting of 59,927 ordinary voters, 410 early voters and 12 overseas absentee voters are eligible to vote in the by-election.

The early voting will be held on May 27 while the polling day is on May 31.

On fielding Dyana, Merdeka Center executive director Ibrahim Suffian said yesterday the party will have a challenging task ahead in changing the perception of the electorate.

“This is something that will take time because perception takes a longer time to build up. DAP has a long-term view of this by trying to recast their image from being a communal to a national party,” Ibrahim told The Malaysian Insider over the weekend.

The respected pollster said that tentative change could be gauged from the upcoming by-election, saying that if DAP managed to poll “a bit more” of support from the Malays, this would be a vindication to the party that it is slowly gaining traction with the community.

The DAP first won the seat, then known as Teluk Anson, in the 1969 parliamentary election when Chan Fu King defeated then MCA Minister for Health Dr Ng Kam Poh in one of the major upsets.

However, since the redelineation of the parliamentary constituencies in 1974, 1984 and 1993, the constituency of Teluk Anson in 1969 had changed with regard to the composition and character of its voters &ndash; allowing Gerakan candidates to win the seat continuously from 1974 until the 1995 general election, when M. Kula Segaran broke the DAP’s losing streak. &ndash; May 19, 2014.
