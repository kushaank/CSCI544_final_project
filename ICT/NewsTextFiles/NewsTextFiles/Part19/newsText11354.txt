
This summer, Dresser-Rand Co. will test a 10-megawatt compressor for undersea oil and gas production at a new test facility in Olean.

The facility, which is under construction and nearly complete, includes what amounts to a giant in-ground pool to submerge a DATUM ICS, a line of custom-built compressors that pump gas into a reservoir to pressurize the well to lift the oil out.

Natural gas is often burned off at the offshore oil rig. But it can be injected back into the ground to create more pressure and get more oil out of the well. One company that wants to do that is Norwegian oil and gas producer Statoil , which is looking to run Dresser-Randâ€™s compressors on the ocean floor.

As part of the test area upgrades, a giant water tank is being built in Olean to house the compressor and drive motor assembly and test its compressor in an undersea environment.

A Dresser-Rand spokesman said the 10-megawatt DATUM ICS separates liquids from the gas stream inside the unitâ€™s casing, and uses a high-speed electric motor thatâ€™s oil-free. This is possible because Dresser-Rand integrated a magnetic bearing technology so the machine can run without oil. This is made possible through a January 2012 acquisition of Synchrony, a technology development company with a portfolio of technologies and products, including active magnetic bearings, high speed motors and generators and power electronics for clean, efficient and reliable rotating machinery.

Figures were not disclosed on the size of the project or the total project investment.
