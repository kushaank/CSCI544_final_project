One popular perception of Wal-Mart Stores is that the retail behemoth from Bentonville has done its part to devastate the U.S. manufacturing sector by buying so many of its goods from China and other overseas locations in its quest for low-cost products to put on its shelves.

But thatâ€™s not how it looks from Steve Grahamâ€™s perspective. The owner of three plastics plants in New England, Graham has been a longtime supplier to Wal-Mart. His fortunes improved significantly, however, last fall after Wal-Mart contracted with him to make the Wonder Loom bracelet-making kit, the only licensed American-made version of the popular Rainbow Loom toy.

He says the Wonder Loom business is supporting 100 new jobs, including temp agency workers and jobs at local suppliers. He says his factories have added about 20 full-time jobs in the past year, largely due to the success of the Wonder Loom. (He now employs about 120 people among his three locations.) And his Toner Plastics business is preparing to move from 25,000 square feet, in two locations in Agawam, to 125,000 square feet in a former box plant in East Longmeadow by the end of June.

This is an outgrowth of Wal-Martâ€™s â€œbuy Americanâ€� initiative that began last year. The countryâ€™s largest brick and mortar retailer committed to procuring an additional $250 billion worth of goods from domestic manufacturers over a 10-year period, including an extra $50 billion in the final year compared to 2013 levels.
