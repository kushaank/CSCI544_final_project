
The P.E.I. Potato Board has joined a campaign to improve perceptions of agriculture, with the hope of attracting more people into the industry.

The board is joining Farm Credit Canada's Agriculture More Than Ever program, which launched a year ago.

The campaign encourages farmers and others in the industry to be agvocates, advocates for agriculture, and to avoid unnecessary negative talk about the industry. Potato Board executive director Greg Donald agrees too much negative talk could be discouraging some from getting into agriculture.

"I don't think it's any different than other businesses. If there is optimism and excitement it certainly is more attractive," said Donald.

"Those of us that are involved, we're very proud of the industry. And this is kind of a neat initiative to allow us to interact with other folks across the country and then share our stories with the general public."

The P.E.I. Federation of Agriculture, the P.E.I. Agriculture Sector Council and the Dairy Farmers of Canada are some of the other partners in the Agriculture More Than Ever program.

Donald said the board doesn't have to invest any money to take part.
