Rydges will receive an overhaul from industry leader in hotel guest experience, Amalgamated Holdings Limited (AHL).

The overhaul will see the Rydges brand add a wider range of additions, including genuine service, unique offerings, world-class facilities and top-shelf amenities all at affordable prices, with the result of this overhaul expected to attract the brand’s leisure and corporate guests.

The new look will see guests enjoying; free WI-FI, a healthier, buffet-style breakfast, new designs for Rydges mini bar options with the AHL style trademark, a wider selection of local and international wines, new staff uniforms and a new, improved, user-friendly website.

“The Rydges brand served our iconic Australasian hotel chain well for many years, but as we embarked on a project to expand the hotel offering, we felt the brand needed refreshing also to suitably reflect the significantly improved guest experience,” AHL group managing director David Seargeant said.

The attention to detail and high level of service offered, have made this Emirates flight experience excellent all round.
