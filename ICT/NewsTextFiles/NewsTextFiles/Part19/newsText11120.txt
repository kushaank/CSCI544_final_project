
Mooresville wants the state to build a taller N.C. 150 bridge between Iredell and Catawba counties when it widens the road in coming years.

The Mooresville Board of Commissioners on Monday night unanimously approved a resolution supporting a taller bridge. Commissioners said it could spur housing growth and higher property values on the north side of Lake Norman.

Built in 1961, the two-lane bridge is only 9 feet to 12 feet above water. That prevents sailboats and commercial charters from accessing the northern part of the lake, including Lake Norman State Park in Troutman, Stan Thompson, a Mooresville-South Iredell Chamber of Commerce member, told commissioners at their May 5 meeting.

The N.C. Department of Transportation continues to welcome such input on its planned widening of the road from two to four lanes, spokeswoman Jordan-Ashley Baker said Monday.

The state plans to expand N.C. 150 from Interstate 77 Exit 36 in Mooresville to four-lane N.C. 16 Bypass in Catawba County.

Right-of-way acquisition on the 13.5-mile stretch scheduled for expansion is expected to begin in 2017, and construction is due to start in 2019.

As the lake areaâ€™s population exploded in recent decades, traffic mounted. N.C. 150 has grown infamous for backups several miles long each morning and afternoon heading to and from the interstate.

N.C. 150 in the Lake Norman area is four lanes for only about a mile, from the interstate west to a Best Buy-anchored retail center at Morrison Plantation Parkway in Mooresville.
