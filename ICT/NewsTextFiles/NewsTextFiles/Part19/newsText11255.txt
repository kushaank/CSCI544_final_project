
LONDON, May 19 (Reuters) - Coal miner Asia Resource Minerals (ARMS) said on Monday it does not intend to go ahead with a proposed delisting of the company from London because the plan lacked shareholder support.

ARMS, formerly known as Bumi Plc, is overhauling itself after its shares dropped almost 80 percent since its flotation in 2010, hit by shareholder in-fighting and a tough trading climate.

On May 6 the company said it would consider a proposal made by its largest shareholder and former chairman Samin Tan, to  distribute shares in its sole subsidiary, Indonesian PT Berau , to existing shareholders and delisting the parent company from London.

Shareholders were split on the proposal.
