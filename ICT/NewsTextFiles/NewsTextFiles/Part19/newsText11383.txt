
Investment firm Lord Abbett & Co. has launched three fixed income funds to provide access to their strategies to non-US institutions and non-US resident investors.

The trio of Ucits-compliant funds mark a major step into the European market for the firm, which oversees $139 billion in assets.

The new launches are mirrors of existing US mutual funds, these are the Lord Abbett Short Duration Income Fund , the Lord Abbett High Yield Fund and the Lord Abbett Strategic Income Fund.

The funds, listed on the Irish Stock Exchange, are currently being marketed in the UK, Ireland, Netherlands, Denmark, Finland and Norway and they will be registered in other markets as well.

‘The launch of these products presents an opportunity for a wide range of investors outside the US, especially in Europe and the Middle East, to access US fixed income markets at a time when we are seeing attractive income opportunities there,’ said Stephen Hillebrecht, fixed income product strategist at Lord Abbett.

The Lord Abbett Short Duration Income Fund focuses on sectors which have demonstrated superior return profiles historically, such as investment grade and high yield short duration mortgage, corporate, government and asset backed securities.

Finally, the Lord Abbett High Yield Fund, is designed to emphasise asset-rich companies with strong management teams, while seeking investment opportunities across the credit spectrum. The High Yield fund will be run by Steven F. Rocco.
