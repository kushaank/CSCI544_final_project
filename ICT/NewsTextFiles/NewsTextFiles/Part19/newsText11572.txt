
Five people, including two foreign nationals, were arrested here with 2.5 kg cocaine and heroin valued Rs.6.25 crore in the international market, police said Monday.

The arrests helped police bust four drug-smuggling rings.

The first ring was busted May 5 after Nigerian national Chijoke Ejikeme, 31, was arrested near Vikas Marg in New Delhi and 50 gram cocaine was recovered from him.

"Ejikeme had come to India in 2009 but stayed on even after his visa expired. After a loss in automobile export business, he took to drug trafficking and came to Delhi a month ago," said Additional Commissioner of Police (Crime Branch) Ashok Chand.

The second drug racket was blown off May 16 when an Uttar Pradesh resident, Jane Alam, 50, was caught at Kashmere Gate in north Delhi with 500 gram heroin.

Alam used to manufacture heroin from opium at his makeshift laboratory located in his residence.

The third and fourth drug operations were finished May 17 with the arrest of Vicky, 20, and Afghan national Rahmatullah, 25, from Samaipur Badli in west Delhi and Saket in south Delhi respectively.

Over 450 gram heroin was recovered from Vicky while Rahmatullah was found to be carrying one kg of the drug.

Rahmatullah's local associate, Arbaz, 22, was also arrested Sunday with 500 gram heroin.
