
LEXINGTON, Mass.--( BUSINESS WIRE )-- N-of-One, the leader in clinical interpretation for precision medicine in        oncology, today announced an agreement with Guardant Health to provide        clinical decision support for Guardant360™, a breakthrough blood test        that enables next generation sequencing of solid tumor DNA. Financial        terms of the agreement are not disclosed.

Guardant360 is the first pan-cancer blood test that helps oncologists        prescribe the right treatments at the right time based on the changing        genomics of a patient's cancer. The test uses trace fragments of tumor        DNA that are shed into the bloodstream ("cell-free DNA") for        reconstructing and sequencing a patient’s cancer to detect emergent        alterations that can help oncologists better match patients to potential        therapeutic options.

N-of-One’s clinical interpretation provides relevant biological and        clinical knowledge related to the mutation profile of the identified        tumor DNA, and links this state-of-the-art knowledge to relevant        therapeutic strategies, including clinical trials, to support        oncologists in making molecularly-informed, personalized treatment        decisions.

"Guardant360 is the first comprehensive, non-invasive tumor sequencing        test providing real-time answers," said Helmy Eltoukhy, Ph.D., Guardant        Health's co-founder and chief executive officer. “Knowledge of genomic        alterations in combination with potential therapies can be most helpful        to an oncologist and the treatment of their patients."

N-of-One, a leader in precision medicine for oncology, leverages its        world-class team of experts to translate molecular data specific to each        patient into state-of-the-art, clinical        insights and therapeutic options. N-of-One’s team of experts has        interpreted more than 7,000 tumors for oncologists and patients        worldwide, through partnerships to provide clinical interpretation for        leading diagnostic companies (such as Foundation Medicine and Clarient),        through agreements with provider networks (such as Fox Chase Cancer        Center in Philadelphia), directly to oncologists and through employee        access benefit programs (such as Life Technologies). N-of-One does not        provide medical advice or promote any product or service. For more        information, please visit www.n-of-one.com or call 617-202-9808.
