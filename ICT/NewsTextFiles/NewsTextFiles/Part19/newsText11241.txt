According to police, Crockett was one of three people caught in the act of stealing from Deborah Nielsen's Buxton home. She was then tied up. According to court papers, Crockett beat Nielsen with a belt sander, a heavy piece of equipment that uses a rotating belt to sand things. prove he's innocent.

Meanwhile, Crockett's attorney, Amy Fairfield, said she has text messages and sworn affidavits that put Crockett in Portland that night, far away from the robbery. He, and at least two friends, say that he was playing pool.

Fairfield said, "It kind of undercuts the state's theory that he was in Buxton and committing a robbery and aggravated assault at 9:15 pm."

Fairfield said she is hoping businesses near the pool hall will be able to provide surveillance video to confirm his alibi.

Crockett is being held at the York County Jail. He turned himself in last night after hiding in the woods for several days. Police said he asked for Mountain Dew and chocolate milk in exchange for his surrender.
