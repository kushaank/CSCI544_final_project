
Shareholders of offshore drilling giant Transocean Ltd. (NYSE: RIG ) approved its $3.00 per share annual dividend payment at the 2014 Annual General Meeting. Most importantly, the latest annual dividend is roughly 33.9% higher than the $2.24 per share dividend approved by shareholders in the 2013 Annual General Meeting. Transocean stated that the increased dividend will likely be paid in four installments slated for Jun 2014, Sep 2014, Dec 2014 and Mar 2015.

On a separate note, on May 15, 2014, Transocean offered a fleet status report for the period commencing Apr 17, 2014 to the reported date. The estimated value of all the new deals and contract extensions in the same time frame is roughly $953.0 million. The update covers the company's offshore drilling rig status and contract information. The expected out-of-service time for 2014 is up by 485 days. However, the projected out-of-service time for 2015 is down by 84 days.

Per the report, Dhirubhai Deepwater KG1− a dynamic positioning drillship − has been contracted to work off the coast of Brazil for a period of three years. The rig will be working at a dayrate of $440,000, lower than the prior rate of $510,000. The deal will likely add roughly $482 million to the company's backlog.

Moreover, Paul B. Loyd Jr − a semisubmersible rig – received a contract extension offer to operate for two additional years at the UK North Sea. The rig is expected to work at a dayrate of $430,000, which is below the previous rate of $447,000. Transocean believes the agreement will contribute $314 million to the backlog project.

Additionally, GSF Development Driller II – a semisubmersible rig – has been contracted to operate three offshore wells located at Black Sea, Romania. The rig will work at a dayrate of $360,000 and will add $97 million to the backlog.

GSF Constellation II − an independent leg cantilever jackup – will likely operate off the coast of Gabon, as a one-year option has been exercised by the customer. Additionally, the company has transferred the residual backlog from Sedco 710 to Sedco 706, a semisubmersible rig.

Switzerland-based Transocean currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that it is expected to perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.
