
May 20, 2014 (LBT) - SriLankan Airlines, the newest member of oneworld alliance, is set to begin offering new codeshares with fellow oneworld member Finnair, a reciprocal arrangement that deepens both airlines’ networks and helps boost travel and tourism between the Nordic countries and Sri Lanka.

As part of the agreement between the two airlines, from  June 2, 2014 Finnair’s AY* code will be added to select SriLankan Airlines services between the Sri Lankan capital Colombo and Frankfurt, Paris, Rome, London, Bangkok and Hong Kong. SriLankan Airlines’ UL* code will accordingly be added to select Finnair services between Helsinki and Frankfurt, Paris, Rome, London, Stockholm, Oslo and Copenhagen.

The codeshare arrangements are subject to relevant regulatory approvals from the territories concerned.

SriLankan Airlines already codeshares with oneworld members Malaysia Airlines and Royal Jordanian, and is also launching new codeshares with S7 Airlines. Discussions on further codeshare arrangements with more oneworld members are at advanced stage.
