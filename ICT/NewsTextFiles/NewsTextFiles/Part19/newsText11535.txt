
Ryanair suffered its first profit fall in five years, but shares surged as investors welcomed a bullish forecast for this year.

Pre-tax earnings for its last financial year fell 9 per cent to £482million, despite a 3 per cent rise in both passenger numbers and revenue.

Ryanair – which has issued two profit warnings in the past year – blamed the impact of the strong pound, high fuel costs and increased competition that forced the airline to cut fares.

The increase helped offset the effect of higher fuel costs and lower fares, which were 4 per cent down amid heightened competition but are forecast by the airline to recover by 2 per cent this year.

Passenger numbers were up 3 per cent for the year to 81.7million. But the Irish carrier is taking no chances with its bid to improve its image and will increase its spend on marketing from £8million to £28.5million.

Part of Ryanair’s image change has been an overhaul of its website, which boss Michael O’Leary said had cut the number of ‘clicks’ needed to buy a flight from 17 to five.

In the autumn it will launch features to attract more business customers, a response to arch-rival easyJet’s highly successful strategy of luring corporate travellers.
