
Barack Obamas plans to shut down the Guantanamo Bay prison are unlikely to see the light of day.

They are already in limbo as legal hurdles, one after another, kept popping up. The latest to surface is another unclassified report which revealed how the Justice Department and the Pentagon tried to convince Congress that existing laws provided robust protection of the national security, and if prisoners are brought to the mainland, they won’t simply walk free on the orders of the court of law.

The point is that Congress doesn’t want itself to be surprised by the judiciary through proactive decisions of releasing the inmates once they come under civil litigation. It is all about the trust deficit, and a lacuna in the relevant laws, which could inevitably come to the rescue of the detainees of yesteryear wars. It’s high time Obama rejigged his priorities and got the camp shut down before its inmates breathed their last.
