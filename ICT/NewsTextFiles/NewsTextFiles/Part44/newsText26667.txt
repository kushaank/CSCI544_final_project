NEW YORK-- Abu Hamza al-Masri, an Egyptian-born British cleric, was convicted of 11 terrorism charges on Monday by a federal jury in Manhattan, a verdict likely to strengthen the hand of those who want terror suspects tried in civilian courts, rather than military commissions.

The monthlong trial marked the second time this year that federal prosecutors in the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office secured a swift conviction in a high-profile terrorism case.

"When there are additional terrorism cases to pursue and to prosecute and to bring swift justice to the people who deserve it...our office is up to the task," U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said during a news conference.

Some critics contend military commissions are the more suitable venue for such trials, arguing that many of the rights afforded defendants in civilian courts, the unpredictability of juries and the challenges of handling classified evidence could lead to acquittals.

The verdict was delivered on the 15th floor of the Manhattan federal courthouse, with the newly constructed One World Trade Center visible just a few blocks away.

Mr. al-Masri's trial was the second of three terrorism cases to be tried in the Southern District of New York in lower Manhattan this year. In March, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Osama bin Laden's son-in-law and former al Qaeda spokesman, was found guilty of conspiracy to kill Americans. The trial of three men accused of helping plot the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania is expected to begin later this year.

Mr. al-Masri, also known as Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. His sentencing is scheduled for September.

As the verdict was read after two days of deliberations, Mr. al-Masri sat silently, wearing a blue jumpsuit. Outside the courtroom, his attorney Joshua Dratel said he would appeal. "It was not about the evidence but about a visceral reaction to the defendant," Mr. Dratel told reporters.

The defense argued that the government's case primarily was built on a series of inflammatory statements Mr. al-Masri had made--such as comparing infidels to cows and pigs, and declaring it acceptable to behead and enslave them--during his career as a preacher.

The government's case was bolstered by several cooperating witnesses who testified against Mr. al-Masri in exchange for protection, government stipends and leniency in their own cases.

Faxes, voice-mail messages and phone records further supported the prosecution's claims that Mr. al-Masri played a key role in a 1998 kidnapping of 16 Western tourists in Yemen, an attempt to found a jihadi training camp in Oregon, and the dispatch of recruits to fight with the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan.

The trial's climax came when Mr. al-Masri testified, a relatively rare occurrence in terrorism trials. He tangled with Assistant U.S. Attorney John Cronan in a combative cross-examination.

Jury foreman Howard Bailynson said Mr. al-Masri is a "skilled orator," but noted that he seemed to have "embellished" his testimony at times.

Mr. Bailynson said he and the other jurors were sensitive to sitting on a high profile terrorism trial, but tried to focus on the facts.

"I feel he got a fair trial," Mr. Bailynson said. "There's no doubt in my mind about that."
