The Muslim Tatars – who are strongly opposed to Moscow’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine – defied a ban on mass gatherings by the new Russian-backed rulers.

As Russian military helicopters circled overhead, the crowd chanted “People, homeland, Crimea!” and heard speeches calling for greater autonomy for Tatars, who make up 12 percent of the region’s population.

In Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, hundreds of Tatars also gathered to commemorate the anniversary.

They have expressed a deep mistrust of the Russian authorities, many associating Moscow’s rule with oppression, exile and suffering.
