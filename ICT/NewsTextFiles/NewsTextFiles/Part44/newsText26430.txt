
SAN FRANCISCO and MUNICH, May 19, 2014 /CNW/ - The high-tech start-up tado° has just launched tado° Cooling - a device designed to make remote controlled air conditioning systems smart. Using tado° saves up to 40% on the electricity bill. People from around the world can back the project on Kickstarter USA and be the first to receive the useful gadget this summer.

The Internet of Things device comes with an intelligent smartphone app. Using location services the app detects when the last person has left the house, and automatically turns down the air conditioning. When any person is on the way home, tado° begins to pre-cool the house. tado°'s indoor positioning system, based on Bluetooth Low Energy/iBeacon® technology, allows one to move throughout the house without turning on and off the ACs. tado°'s room-to-room feature knows what room to cool and when. Even users without a smartphone can take advantage of tado°'s intelligence thanks to its array of ambient light, motion and noise sensors.

With the tado° app on your smartphone you can monitor and adjust temperatures and humidity at home - even while on the move. The tado° Cooling device itself has a translucent LED display and a capacitive touch interface for quick adjustments.

The new tado° device is compatible with any remote controlled wall mounted, split, in-window, or portable AC unit. It connects to the AC via infrared and links it to the Internet via WiFi.
