
(Reuters) - The Thai army's declaration of martial law on Tuesday is designed to restore peace and order and does not constitute a coup, Agence France-Presse said, quoting an announcement on military-run television.

Earlier, media quoted an army statement issued in Bangkok as saying that martial law had been declared after six months of anti-government protests and political crisis.
