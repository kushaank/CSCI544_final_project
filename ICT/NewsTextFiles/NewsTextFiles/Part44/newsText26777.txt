
While the situation in Ukraine remains uncertain, travel businesses that head to the area are taking steps to keep their customers safe. Exeter International, for example, has already canceled its trips to Ukraine, and now Silversea Cruises has modified the itineraries for four Black Sea voyages originally scheduled to call inYalta, Sevastopol, or Odessa this year.

Silver Spirit’s July 21 seven-day sailing will remain entirely a Black Sea itinerary with Trabzon replacing Odessa, while three new nine-day voyages will focus on destinations in Greece and Turkey, and also retain the original Black Sea ports of Constanza and Nessebur.
