
Still nursing his wounds from his recent scandal, Christie tries to win supporters by taking a shot at Obama's 'disappointing' foreign policy.

Christie was speaking to Jewish leaders at the Champions of Jewish Values International Awards Dinner when he criticized President Obama's handling of Russia, Iran, and Syria.

"Once you draw that red line, you enforce it, because if you don't, America's credibility will be at stake," he said on Syria.

This event was sponsored by billionaire Republican donor Sheldon Adelson , to whom Christie had to apologize after he referred to the Israeli-controlled West Bank as "occupied territories." That is just one of the flubs the embattled governor is trying to fix as he gears up for a possible 2016 presidential run. Diverting attention from the Bridgegate scandal, which lowered his approval ratings, Christie took a hard line on foreign policy.

"We will either lead, or we will disappoint," he said. "Today in my opinion America is disappointing. But it's not too late...It is time for us to stand up again and lead."
