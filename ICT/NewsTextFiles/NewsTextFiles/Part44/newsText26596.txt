
Galatasaray  attacker  Didier Drogba  has donated €1 million to the families of the victims of the mining disaster in Soma, Turkey.

The Istanbul giants’ players wore helmets ahead of their league game against Kayseri Erciyesspor at the weekend to show their support and the Cote d’Ivoire international has gone one step further in his role as U.N. ambassador.

“I am a U.N. ambassador of goodwill and I will do all that I can to help the people in Soma,” Drogba told reporters.

On May 13 an explosion at a coal mine in Soma, Turkey, caused an underground mine fire, which burned until 15 May.
