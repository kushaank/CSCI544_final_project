
Swedish DJ and music producer Avicii nabbed the award for top dance song at the American Billboard Music Awards last night. His song "Wake me up" has become a world wide hit.

Avicii, or Tim Bergling, released his album "True" last autumn and has since won the MTV award for best electronic music in November as well as the Swedish government's Music Export Prize in February.

Justin Timberlake was without doubt the evening's biggest winner. He took home seven awards, including the one for top artist.
