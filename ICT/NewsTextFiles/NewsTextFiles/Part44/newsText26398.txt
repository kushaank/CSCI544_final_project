
There was rioting in eastern districts of Solomon Islands' capital Honiara on 16 and 17 May, with one shopping centre looted and burnt.

Radio Australia reported on 19 May that more than 400 people were involved in the riots. The Solomon Islands riot control unit responded to the unrest, with the support of the international police mission in the country, using teargas to disperse the rioters. Around 50 people have been arrested.

The riots follow flooding in April that killed 21 people and left an estimated 10,000 people homeless in Honiara. According to the local police, the rioters were primarily people affected by the flooding.
