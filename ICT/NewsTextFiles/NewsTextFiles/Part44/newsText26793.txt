
An 11-year old Russian girl, who has been staying in Slavyansk in eastern Ukraine without her parents since February, a major hotspot in the military stand-off between Kiev and pro-federalization forces, was brought back home after a special operation.

â€œIt took a month to get the operation ready and two days to   carry it out,â€� Pavel Astakhov, Russiaâ€™s ombudsman for   childrenâ€™s rights who worked in cooperation with the Foreign   Ministry, to secure the girlâ€™s return, told RIA Novosti.

The girl, Anya Vasilenko, was sent by her parents to spend some   time with her aunt in Slavyansk in the Donetsk region in   February, while her family was moving from Primorsky Kray, in the   Far East, to Belgorod situated in a southwestern region,   bordering Ukraine.

When tension between Kiev and the eastern regions started to   grow, Anyaâ€™s parents tried to get their daughter back. They were,   however, denied entry to Ukraine, so they decided to seek help at   the ombudsmanâ€™s office.

Anyaâ€™s father, who used to serve in the Russian military, said he   was ready to do anything, even cross the border illegally.

The conflict between the government and the pro-federalization   movement worsened in mid-April, when several cities in the   Lugansk and Donetsk regions took control of local   administrations. Kiev responded with a military crackdown on   protesters. Anya eventually found herself in a place where some   of the fiercest fighting has taken place.

During the last month and a half, Anya and her relatives didnâ€™t   even go out, as they could here gunshots and blasts every day.   Only the men went outside to get food.

â€œIt was of course scary there, I had to hide in the   basement,â€� the girl told an Itar-Tass correspondent on her   return.

Anya was eventually spirited out of Slavyansk in a car with a   diplomatic number plate. It took her and her two cousins through   four check-points up to the border with Russia.

Russian diplomats managed to arrange things in a way that Annaâ€™s   crossing the border was an absolutely legal one. Pavel Astakhov   said the Ukrainians checked her documents at the border for about   an hour, but eventually let the girl out.

â€œIn this way, Russian authorities not only helped the child   to be reunited with her family, but also tried once again to draw   the attention of the international community to the obligations   of Ukrainian authorities to ensure the safety of peaceful   citizens, to protect lives and to organize safe corridors for   children, women and the elderly, who want to leave zones of   military conflit,â€� Astakhov said.

The childrenâ€™s rights ombudsman said he was going to address the   UN and the European Council, asking the organizations to take   note of Ukraineâ€™s failure to comply with the Geneva Convention   for the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War.
