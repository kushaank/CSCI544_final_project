
Russian gas giant Gazprom is seeking a stock listing in Singapore, complementing its current listings on several exchanges worldwide, according to a report by Reuters.

The move could come as early as July.

Gazprom is also negotiating a deal to supply natural gas to China as tensions between Russia and the West over the Ukraine crisis raise questions about its markets in Europe.

"I consider the chances (of obtaining a listing in Singapore) are high, if Gazprom said it should be done," said Viktor Zubkov, chairman of Gazprom's board of directors.

Already, Gazprom's shares are traded on exchanges in Moscow, Frankfurt, and London, while the state owns a controlling stake of just over half the company, according to Gazprom'sÂ  website .

Sanctions placed on Russia by the U.S. and European Union (EU) were reported to have affected oil markets this spring.
