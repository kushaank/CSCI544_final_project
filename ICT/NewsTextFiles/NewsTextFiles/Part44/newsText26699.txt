"The election campaign has started, but many fear an escalation of violence, particularly in view of the elections. Anything could happen", explained Archbishop Marayati. He added that the news coming out of the embattled city of Homs is not reassuring. "The siege of the government army has prevailed over the rebels, who evacuated the city center", said the archbishop, "but since then gangs have plundered everything they find in houses that are still abandoned, even in the neighborhood where Christians lived."
