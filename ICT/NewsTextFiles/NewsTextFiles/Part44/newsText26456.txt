
The CEO explains the company's work on the Utsira High electrification project has been thorough.

Experts and politicians have criticised Statoil for operating with excessively high cost figures regarding electrification of Utsira High.

A much higher electricity price than the market expects forward is part of what Statoil have included in their assessment.

Extra costs for Ivar Aasen field electrification will be quadrupled if this process is carried out simultaneously with the Utsira High's Johan Sverdrup field, oil company Det norske say.

The company has also built in a higher loss regarding transmitting electricity from land to the Utsira High platforms. The level exceeds experts' opinions of what this should be.

"We work extremely thoroughly on all our projects, which of course includes Johan Sverdrup. We use the same overall project assumptions, irrespective of whether it is Johan Sverdrup or other projects," Helge Lund told Aftenbladet, Friday.

He added he thinks Statoil has presented a good solution for the first phase of Johan Sverdrup.

"This solution covers 60-70 per cent of the CO2 and balances many considerations in an acceptable way.
