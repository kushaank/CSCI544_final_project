
KOTA KINABALU: The High Court here yesterday heard that security forces seized clothing after a skirmish in Kampung Tanjung Batu, Lahad Datu last year, with words associated with the Sulu militants imprinted on the garments.

On his fifth day of identifying items seized on March 7, last year, ASP Mursalim Mohd Salleh identified 18 t-shirts, of which six were in camouflage print, 10 (white), one (black) and another yellow.

He said the camouflage t-shirts bore the words, ‘Royal Security Force’ imprinted on the front of the garments, while the initial ‘RSF’ were imprinted on the back.

The prosecution’s 27th witness, who is a General Operations Force (GOF) platoon commander, said the white t-shirts also had the words, ‘Royal Security Force’ imprinted along with the words, ‘North Borneo Sultanate Republic’.

He identified one black t-shirt and another in yellow, with the words, ‘Royal Sulu Force’.

Mursalim also identified six camouflage uniform shirts, seven camouflage uniform pants and three camouflage lace-up boots as the items he seized from the village.

Thirty accused, comprising 27 Filipinos and three local residents, are being tried in the case, in which some are facing multiple charges of being members of a terrorist group or waging war against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, recruiting members for a terrorist group or wilfully harbouring individuals they knew to be members of a terrorist group.

They allegedly committed the offences between Feb 12 and April 10 last year.
