To be clear, we’re not saying that MERS – a respiratory syndrome -is anything sinister. It’s just a bug. But it is contagious and potentially deadly.

Health officials say MERS made its way to Indiana and Florida after people reportedly picked it up in Saudi Arabia. Then a business interaction sent it over to Illinois too.

So far it seems the victims are all okay. Still, hospitals and healthcare workers are prepping for the worst.
