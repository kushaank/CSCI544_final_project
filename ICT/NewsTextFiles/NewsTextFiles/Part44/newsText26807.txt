
Ukraine must build a pattern of relations with Russia that would guarantee security for Ukrainian citizens, said independent Ukrainian lawmaker and presidential candidate Petro Poroshenko.

"If a country is to deal with Russia as an equal, it must be strong," Poroshenko said at a press conference in Zaporizhia on Sunday. He said solidarity from Ukraine's partners - the United States, the European Union and the G7 group of industrialized states - is needed here.

Poroshenko also said, "We must build a pattern of relation with our neighbor, Russia, that world guarantee security to Ukrainian citizens in the first place."

Ukraine must demand that Russia honor all of its international obligations, he said. "Our third task in succession, but first in importance is to take very resolute measures and use all levers to get Crimea back," the Ukrainian politician said.

No compromises must be allowed with Russia on Ukraine's European choice, he said. "Immediately following the elections I will get the Association Agreement urgently ratified," Poroshenko said.
