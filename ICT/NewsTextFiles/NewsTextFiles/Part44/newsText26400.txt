
The Police Commissioner in Solomon Islands has appealed for residents in Honiara to stay home unless they have a reason to be out tonight as police try to avoid a repeat of riots on Friday and Saturday night.

Our correspondent in Honiara, Dorothy Wickham, says the police have significantly increased their presence in the city after being caught off guard on Friday when a shopping centre was destroyed by fire.

About 50 people were arrested, 35 of whom have been granted bail.

However, Dorothy Wickham says people are anticipating that violence will descend upon Honiara again this evening, with many businesses remaining closed today, and private security guards standing out front.
