
DONETSK, May 19. /ITAR-TASS/. Representatives from the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) will not take part in nationwide roundtable on national unity in Donetsk, announced by the Kiev-appointed Donetsk Region Governor, Sergei Taruta.

“Our representatives are not going to take part in it,” sources from the press centre of the self-proclaimed republic said.

“A roundtable on national unity under the patronage of former Ukrainian presidents Leonid Kravchuk and Leonid Kuchma will be held in Donetsk on May 21,” Taruta said at a news conference earlier on Monday, adding that it will be held with consultative support of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).

Co-chairman of the DNR’s presidium, Miroslav Rudenko, said on May 14 that Taruta had “no real authority” in the region.

“Kiev’s protege Taruta can call himself governor as much as he likes, but he has no real authority,” he said then.

Earlier, roundtables on national unity were held in capital Kiev and Kharkiv, eastern Ukraine, on May 14 and 17 accordingly. These consultations were held amid a continuing punitive operation, carried out by Kiev-controlled army units and paramilitary groups in the southeast of Ukraine. Some Ukrainian politicians said they had failed and had no prospects because of giving no heed to people’s opinion.
