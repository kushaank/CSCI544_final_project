
MILWAUKEE-Sheriff David Clarke issued the following statement Monday regarding a violent weekend in the Milwaukee where shootings claimed three lives.

 "This uptick in violence is not new.  It has been going on since 2010.  The only period of calm we  get is when winter sets in.  The reason crime and violence rise in the summer is NOT due to the hot weather, leading to short tempers, like so many think.  It rises in summer months because you have more human interaction due to more people being on the streets enjoying what little summer we have.  Any time you have human interaction you have the potential for conflict, thus we see more violence.
