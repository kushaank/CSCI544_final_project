
A large multinational crisis management exercise has kicked off in Larnaca, with the participation of thirteen countries.

The drill is being executed in the framework of the national crisis management action plan “Estia”, providing for the mass evacuation of citizens from the Middle East via Cyprus.

The countries taking part are Australia, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Canada, the UK, the USA, Norway and Holland.

For the past few years Cyprus has prepared to provide temporary shelter to foreign nationals fleeing from the neighbouring region in the event the Syrian crisis deteriorates.

In 2006, France, the USA, UK and Italy shipped citizens to Cyprus during the crisis in Lebanon.
