
Five Chinese individuals have been indicted Monday by a U.S. grand jury of cyber spying charges on six U.S. companies and allegedly stealing trade secrets.

This is the first time that U.S. publicly accused China of cyber espionage.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation traced the computer attacks to Unit 61398 of the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army, stationed in a building in Shanghai, China.

The U.S. Justice Department said the Chinese hackers targeted U.S. companies in the nuclear power, metals and solar products industries to steal information useful to competitors in China.

Officials gave an example of hacking done by the indicted Chinese individuals. They said the hackers stole cost, pricing and strategy information from SolarWorld at the very time the company was losing market share to Chinese rivals.

Senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International studies James Lewis said it sends a strong message to the Chinese.

It is not yet clear how the hackers would be brought to justice in the United States.
