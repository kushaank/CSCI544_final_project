
Vietnam’s relevant agencies have created favourable conditions for China to repatriate Chinese workers at the Formosa project in central Ha Tinh province by air and by sea, at the request of the Chinese Embassy in Hanoi and the Chinese contractor.

Following the incident at the Formosa project invested by Taiwan (China) in central Ha Tinh province’s Vung Ang Economic Zone, the provincial authorities and relevant agencies have taken a series of measures to support both domestic and foreign organisations and individuals that suffered from damages in terms of health and asset.

They also worked to strengthen security and order, while detaining and launching legal proceedings against extremists who committed law violations.

The situation at Formosa and other projects in Vung Ang Economic Zone has returned to normal.

Formosa project’s owner, contractors, engineers and workers from China and Taiwan recognised the Vietnamese side’s support and thanked them for handling the incident in a prompt and effective manner.

The Formosa project’s General Director Yang Hong Zhi from Taiwan affirmed the investor will continue to implement the project in accordance with schedule.

On May 14, a parade in the Vung Ang Economic Zone opposing China’s illegal placement of a drilling rig in Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone turned into a clash with foreign experts and workers at the project.

Taking advantage of the situation, some people set fire to the houses of foreign workers and stole company assets, machinery and other equipment.
