
SINGAPORE — Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong wrote today (May 19) to Mr Narendra Modi, Prime Minister-elect of India, to express his “heartiest congratulations” on the victory of Mr Modi’s Bharatiya Janata (BJP) Party in India’s general elections.

The BJP won 282 seats in the 543 member parliament, the biggest victory in 30 years. Describing the results as a “resounding victory” for Mr Modi’s party, Mr Goh recalled their previous meetings and frank exchange of views. These began with Mr Goh’s 2006 visit to Gujarat, where Mr Modi served as Chief Minister.
