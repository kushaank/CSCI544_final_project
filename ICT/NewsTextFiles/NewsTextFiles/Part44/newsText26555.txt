
PHUKET: A police officer working in Phuket’s provincial narcotics unit turned himself in on Saturday (May 17) to answer charges that he shot and killed a karaoke hostess on the street on Friday (May 16).

Emergency workers try to save Ms Nootsika after the shooting. They were not able to revive her.

Nootsika Glaseuk, 36, from Ranong, had just walked out of the Saraphan Pleng pub near Chalong Circle when she was hit in the head by a bullet fired from a passing pickup truck.

Pol Col Peerayut Karajedi, Deputy Commander of Phuket Police, told The Phuket News today that the officer, Pol Sen Sgt Maj Sompong Santathiwong, turned himself in on Saturday to deny that he murdered Ms Nootsika.

“From our initial investigation, we suspected that it might be him who fired the shot. He came to meet the investigators to declare his innocence. He denied shooting her and has said he will defend himself in court,” said Col Peerayut.

“The legal process is proceeding, and the charges will be depend on the evidence. Right now, nothing is clear, it’s all just suspicion.

Pol Lt Kraisorn Boonprasob, who is in charge of the investigation, said that SSM Sompong has denied shooting anything or anyone.

Officers, he added, had retrieved the bullet casing from the scene and it will be sent for DNA analysis to see if SSM Sompong handled it.

Col Peerayut explained, “We need to question witnesses and look at circumstantial, physical and documentary evidence and so on.

“At this point we cannot confirm that he did it or that he did not do it; he can tell us anything he wants.
