BAGHDAD – At least 10 people were killed and 11 others injured Monday in separate attacks in the Iraqi capital Baghdad, a security source said.

Three people were killed and 5 others injured when a roadside bomb exploded in the predominantly Sunni Ghazaliya district of Baghdad, said the source, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

Two pro-government Sahwa militiamen were also killed and six others injured in an attack by unidentified militants on their checkpoint in Abu Gharib in western Baghdad, he added.

The source said five bodies of slain civilians were found with gunshot wounds in the Hussainia and Zafraniya districts of the capital.

Recent months have seen an uptick in violence across Iraq. Although most attacks go unclaimed, Iraqi authorities usually point the finger at Al-Qaeda-linked militants.
