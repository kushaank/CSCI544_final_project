
ORLANDO, Fla. (May 19, 2014) A man from Saudi Arabia who is one of three patients diagnosed with an infection from a Middle East respiratory virus in the United States has been released from a hospital, officials from the state health department and Dr. P. Phillips Hospital said in a news release Monday.

The unidentified 44-year-old man has recovered from the virus and is now testing negative for Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, they said.

Officials say at least 20 health care workers at two Orlando hospitals came into contact with the man, and they all have tested negative, too.

A man in Indiana was the first to be diagnosed in the U.S. with a case of the MERS virus, and an Illinois man picked up a MERS-related infection from that man.
