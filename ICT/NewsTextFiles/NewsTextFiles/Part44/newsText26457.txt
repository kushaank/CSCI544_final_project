A frontal system today brought heavy rainfall for northeastern Minnesota with precipitation totaling over an inch.

Paynesville, Minnesota reported a midday total of 1.29 inches of rain, and flood advisories have been issued from Duluth, to Ely, and Grand Marais.

Meanwhile, to the south, this low pressure system created a trough of low pressure that extended down the Plains and pulled warm air northward from Mexico.

This created above normal temperatures with highs approaching 100 degrees for Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. The back side of this system brought cooler air into the Western states from the North and allowed for breezy conditions to move off the Rockies and into the Plains.

Thus, high fire danger remained a matter of concern from Arizona and New Mexico, into southern Colorado and the southern Plains. Red flag warnings have been issued due to 25 mph winds, gusting to 45 mph and very dry conditions with relative humidity near 10 percent.

Further west, a low pressure system off the coast of the Pacific Northwest slowly approached the West Coast. This pushed some moisture onshore, which kicked up scattered showers over northern California as well as Oregon and Washington.

-HIGHEST WIND GUST (MPH).................................56 Mt. Washington, New Hampshire.

-HIGHEST PRECIPITATION (INCHES)..........................1.29 Paynesville, Minn.

-An extraordinary aurora borealis over Ludvika, Sweden was described as an "ice-covered lake on which the moon was shining" on this date in 1883. The aurora began as a faint band of light parallel to the horizon, but grew much broader and brighter.
