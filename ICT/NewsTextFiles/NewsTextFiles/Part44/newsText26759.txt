
BERLIN, May 19 (Reuters) - Europe's Energy Commissioner said on Monday progress had been made in the gas price dispute between Russia and Ukraine after talks with Russia's energy minister and Gazprom and said a fresh round of negotiations was scheduled for May 26.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has urged EU leaders to do more to help Ukraine through its economic crisis and resolve the standoff over gas. He has threatened to cut exports if Kiev fails to pay in advance for June deliveries.

"We have in the last few days made progress on a number of issues but we still have no agreement," said the EU's Guenther Oettinger, adding further talks between Russia, Ukraine and the EU would take place next Monday, probably in Berlin.

He added that he expected Kiev to use any forthcoming aid packages from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and European Union to pay for past and future gas deliveries.

"We want to solve the problems before June 1," Oettinger said, adding the EU would do all it could to ensure Ukraine pays its outstanding bills and to safeguard Europe's supplies.
