
Bangkok: Thailand's acting prime minister was huddled with senators here Monday to find a way out of a protracted political crisis, as anti-government protestors stepped up pressure to remove him and install a new administration, media reports said.

Thailand has been stuck in political limbo following the dismissal of prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra and nine of her ministers May 7 after a court found them guilty of abuse of power.

The government and its supporters view a new general election as the best way to solve the crisis but a vote tentatively scheduled for July 20 now appears a far cry. The ruling Puea Thai Party is touted as well placed to win.
