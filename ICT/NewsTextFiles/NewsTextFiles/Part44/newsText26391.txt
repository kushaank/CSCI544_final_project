
(MENAFN) Singapore Airlines said it will stop its flights to Riyadh and Cairo, but continue operating its flights to Jeddah, however, according to Arab News.

The company said that the last flight to Riyadh will be operated on September 28 2014 and the last flight to Cairo will be operated on September 30 2014.

It said the "difficult decision to suspend the services was taken as a result of the sustained weak performance of both routes."
