
The Justice Ministry of Ukraine, in close cooperation with law enforcement officers, is collecting evidence for an appeal to court to prohibit the activities of the Communist Party of Ukraine.

"We're collecting an evidence base in close contact with police officers, and we will file relevant lawsuits as soon as we receive the full package of documents from the Prosecutor General's Office and the Security Service of Ukraine," Justice Ministry Pavlo Petrenko said at a briefing in Kyiv on Monday.

He said that after they receive a relevant presentation of the Justice Ministry on Monday, they will send a request to the Prosecutor General's Office and the Security Service of Ukraine to investigate possible criminal violations committed by the leadership of the Communist Party.

As reported, Ukraine's Acting President Oleksandr Turchynov wrote a letter to Justice Minister Pavlo Petrenko asking him to examine whether the Communist Party of Ukraine was involved in activities aimed at violating the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

"I hereby ask the Ukrainian Justice Ministry to examine whether the Communist Party of Ukraine was involved in the actions aimed at violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity or our state, undermining its security, the illegal takeover of government buildings, and to immediately take statutory measures to ban the Communist Party of Ukraine," reads the letter which was posted on the acting president's Web site on Monday.

In particular, data analysis from the Ukrainian Security Service suggests that certain Communist leaders and activists in the southeastern regions of Ukraine provide "not only verbal support for terrorists but also practical, technical and material assistance to representatives of the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics," the acting president said.
