
KIGALI, May 19 (Reuters) - Growth in African economies is set to accelerate to 4.8 percent on average this year while financial flows into the continent will top $200 billion, or quadruple levels seen in 2000, the African Development Bank said on Monday.

At the start of its annual meeting in the Rwandan capital Kigali, the bank had a positive message on the continent's economic growth outlook, but it tempered it with warnings on insecurity in parts of the continent and the need to ensure jobs were being created to stave off the risk of social discontent.

"Africa's medium-term growth prospects have improved on the back of broader political and social stability at home and recovering economic conditions abroad," the bank (AfDB) said in its annual African Economic Outlook report.

It forecast economic growth across the continent would reach 5.7 percent on average in 2015, putting its trajectory back on the path it was before the global financial crisis of 2009.
