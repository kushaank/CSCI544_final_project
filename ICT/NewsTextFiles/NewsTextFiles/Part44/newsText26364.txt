Self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) will not recognise elections of the President of Ukraine on the 25th of May, as they are illegal and violate the Constitution. “People’s governor” of Donbas Pavlo Gubaryov announced this during his interview to the channel “Russia 24″. Reports  LIGABusinessInform .

“We consider the presidentials election on the 25th of may illegitimate, they violate art. 103 of the Constitution. Holding them on the territory of our Independent States (Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics) is illegal, and I think that they will not even attempt to do so. Of course, I can say that we do not recognize these elections,” – he stated.

At the same time Gubaryov admits that Europe, the U.S. and the international financial community will recognize these elections. “They will sign a fettering association agreement, projects of the development of shale gas in Ukraine will be continued, the rights of the Russian-speakers will continue to be infringed and veterans will have their ribbons ripped off,” – said the self-proclaimed leader of the “DPR”.

The first round of the presidential elections in Ukraine will be held May 25, 2014.

According to the Head of the President Administration Sergiy Pashinskiy, it will be problematic to hold elections on the half of the territory of Donbas.

This law is registered as No4835. It will allow to change address of the district electoral commissions, will strengthen protection of the commissions and registrars of voters and documentation, the Security Services can be involved in the protection.
