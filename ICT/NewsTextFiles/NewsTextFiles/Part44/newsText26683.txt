
Members of the Boko Haram have killed a Chinese worker and kidnapped 10 others in Cameroon, piling more pressure on leaders meeting in Paris to thrash out a tougher strategy against the Islamists.

Militants stormed an encampment used by Chinese road workers on Friday night in a region of northern Cameroon,  just across the border from the strongholds where they sparked global outrage by abducting more than 200 schoolgirls in April.

An official in Waza, a town near the site of the attack said that the Boko Haram militants were heavily armed and came in five vehicles.

He said that the camp where the Chinese road workers stayed was usually guarded by soldiers from Cameroon’s elite Rapid Intervention Battalion, but many of the troops were in Yaounde for a military parade ahead of National Day on May 20.

A local police chief added that Cameroonian soldiers retaliated and the fighting lasted for several hours.
