Evangelical Fellowship of Zambia (EFZ) Executive Director Pukuta Mwanza says there is no guarantee that the Patriotic Front will bounce back to power after the 2016 elections considering their performance so far.

Reverend Mwanza has told QFM News in an interview that the PF government should ensure that they fulfill the promises they made to the people of Zambia prior to the 2011 election before the 2016 polls.

He says with 2016 fast approaching, the Zambian people will decided whether to keep the PF in power or vote them out based on the promises they made.

Rev Mwanza singles out the delivery of a new people driven constitution as one of the key promises the Patriotic Front made to the people of Zambia.

He states that Zambians are anxiously waiting for the delivery of a new constitution as promised.

Meanwhile Reverend Mwanza says the Patriotic Front government should ensure that they pay up all the debts they have contracted before 2016.

He says when the Patriotic Front took office, they found the country debt free, and therefore they should leave no outstanding debt.

The next goverment should withhold gratuity for all pf MPs and use that money towards the repayment of all these loans and secondly sata’s pension and other monthly retirement allowances shud be servicing this debit.

That could be a valid observation, I urge you and your and your fellow clergy  to lead Zambians in fasting for forty days for PF leaders to be financial prudence, and for new leaders. Otherwise it is wishful thinking. Bola ni ninety minutes.

The man of God hs seen our future 2016 pf is out, pliz don’t leave in debt.
