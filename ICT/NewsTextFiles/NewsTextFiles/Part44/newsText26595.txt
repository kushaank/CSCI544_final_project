
ANKARA - Turkey has sent a team of experts to identify the needs and coordinate Turkey's relief aid in flood-hit Bosnia, as it struggles in the aftermath of floods which have left at least 35 people dead and forced tens of thousands to evacuate their homes across the Balkan Peninsula.

The floods across Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia are believed to be the heaviest in the region in a century. Officials expect the death toll to rise.

An estimated 300,000 people in Serbia and an additional 50,000 in Bosnia are without access to electricity or drinking water, many living in unsafe and unsanitary conditions.

As rescue coordinators appeal for food, water and essential needs to help those affected, humanitarian support has streamed from across the world.

"Turkish Coordination Agency and our embassy in Sarajevo are reaching those in need as well, Turkey's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Sunday. Turkish Red Crescent will also send a total of 2,250 blankets and 432 kitchen supplies to the area."
