
Gunmen travelling in a car opened fire early on Tuesday on a group of Egyptian policemen near Cairo's Al-Azhar university, killing three and wounding nine others, the interior ministry said.

The attack comes just days ahead of a presidential election on May 26-27, which former army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is expected to win.
