
FREETOWN — The Planning Board will hold a public hearing Tuesday to discuss the adoption of the revised National Flood Insurance Rate Maps.

The meeting is at 7 p.m. at the Senior Center, 227 Chace Road.

Building Commissioner Mary McNeil said the revised maps are based on studies of coastal and river line areas of the town. “It’s a truer reflection,” she said. These are the first revisions since 2009.

McNeil said the areas affected by the revisions include Main Street, Narrows Road, Route 79, South Main Street and Assonet Bay Shores.

The changes vary, she said, with some maps getting larger and some decreasing in size.

The new Flood Insurance Rate Maps will go into effect on July 16. Freetown residents will vote on whether to adopt the revised maps at the June 2 Town Meeting, with a two-thirds majority vote required for approval.

Planning Technician Lauren Moreau said the Planning Board will take a vote on whether to recommend adopting the maps on Tuesday.

McNeil said that if Freetown fails to adopt the new maps, no one in the town will be able to apply for flood insurance through the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

She added that such a change would be permanent. “Once a town removes itself from the National Flood Insurance Program, we can never go back on,” she said.

All maps are available for viewing at the Town Hall in the town clerk’s office or the Building Department. They are also viewable online by searching on the FEMA Map Service Center at msc.fema.gov.
