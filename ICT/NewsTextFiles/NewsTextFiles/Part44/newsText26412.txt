
SAN MARINO >> Less than a week after some residents pushed to end the city’s first farmers market for fear of the “riffraff” it could attract, a mailer sharing the same sentiment was sent about a proposed bike plan meeting.

The draft plan by Ryan Snyder and Associates maps about 27 miles of bike routes, including on Huntington Drive, San Marino Avenue, Sierra Madre Boulevard and Lorain Road.

The Traffic Advisory Commission received a presentation of the Draft Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan Monday. The 121-page document is also available on the city website.

The proposed bike plan will likely appear before the City Council in June or July, Assistant City Manager Lucy Garcia said.

Javier Hernandez, program director of Bike San Gabriel Valley, said Huntington Drive has historically been a major transportation corridor.

Bike San Gabriel Valley and Day One, a Pasadena-based nonprofit focused on community health, have partnered with Monterey Park, San Gabriel, Baldwin Park, El Monte and South El Monte to develop a Regional Bicycle Master Plan .

Because San Marino’s proposed bike lane plan is still in flux, it is uncertain how much money, if any, San Marino will devote to the project.

If it is approved without too many changes, the city could devote at least $5.1 million to the project, according to a staff report. This amount does not include potential costs associated with community education, programming or enforcement. Some funds to pay for costs will come from grants.

San Marino has one pilot bikeway on Del Mar Avenue from Huntington Drive to its south city limits.

Wesley Reutimann, environmental prevention director at Day One, said pedestrian- and bike-friendly cities have residents who are less prone to chronic conditions such as obesity, heart disease and diabetes.

Additionally, bikeways narrow city streets and make drivers slow down on wide thoroughfares such as Huntington Drive, Reutimann said.
