
Turkey is ready to offer every kind of help to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has told Bosnian and Serbian leaders as Balkan countries face their worst floods in more than a century.

Sources close to the Turkish prime minister told Anadolu Agency on Monday that Erdogan called Bakir Izetbegovic, the Bosniak Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbian Prime Minister, Alexander Vucic, to offer assistance and his condolences for the loss of lives.

Balkan leaders thanked the Turkish prime minister for offer and also expressed their condolences for the 301 miners killed in the Soma coal mine disaster last week in western Turkey.
