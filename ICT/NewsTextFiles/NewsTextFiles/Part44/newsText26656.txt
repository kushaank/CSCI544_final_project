
Taipei, May 19 (CNA) Thousands of visitors, mostly students, lined up to gain entry to the 2014 Young Designers' Exhibition (YODEX) in Taipei Monday, the last day of the four-day show.

Organized by the Industrial Development Bureau under the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Taiwan Design Center, the show, now in its 33rd year, brought together works by 131 departments from 61 schools nationwide.

There were also foreign exhibitors from 11 schools in the United States, Canada, Italy and Japan. Over 4,000 designs by 9,000 students were on display, according to the organizers.

"I have come to the show for two years in a row," said Mark Chen, a 17-year-old student from Taipei. "I really like it a lot, as there are many interesting things to see," he added.

Another visitor, Erica Lin, told CNA that an event like this provides an opportunity for designers to not only showcase their works but also learn from others.

"It is inspiring," said Lin, who said she wants to major in graphic design.

This year's show has expanded its scope from being a cradle for nurturing innovative concepts to a platform for companies seeking potential products and employees, the organizers said.

The four-day event took place at the Taipei World Trade Center May 16-19.
