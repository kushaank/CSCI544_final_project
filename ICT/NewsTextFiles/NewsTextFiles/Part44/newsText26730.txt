
A Ugandan parliamentary committee has asked government to uphold the ban on the importation of used computers to stop the country from being used as a dumping ground. This after earlier recommendations on the issue had not been adhered to.

New Vision reports that the computers are still being imported, packaged and disguised as new ones in order to exploit consumers. 'With the evolution of technology, importing second hand computers only serves the purpose of making Uganda a dumping ground,' said Bunya County West MP, Vincent Bagiire.
