
The people of South Sudan, already exposed to conflict and hunger, are this week facing a new threat - cholera. The outbreak of the highly contagious disease in Juba ahead of tomorrow's donor pledging conference in Oslo, organised by Norway and the United Nations, demonstrates how urgently funds are needed to respond to the increasingly dire humanitarian crisis unfolding in the world's newest nation.

Oxfam's South Sudan country director Cecilia Milan who is in Oslo, said: 'The confirmation of 138 cholera cases in Juba is a stark reminder of the multitude of risks the citizens of this country have been forced to endure since conflict broke out in December 2013. There is no question - the international community must act now to prevent a rapidly escalating food crisis - and now potentially a public health emergency - in South Sudan.'
