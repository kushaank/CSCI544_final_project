
Gunmen shot dead two Egyptian policemen on Monday in the central city of Minya as they were heading home, the interior ministry said.

Militant attacks targeting policemen have risen since the army ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in July last year.

The two policemen, riding on a motorbike, were shot dead on the Minya-Assiut highway, the ministry said.

The attack comes just days ahead of the May 26-27 presidential election, which former army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi who ousted Morsi is expected to win.

In April, a court in Minya triggered an international outcry after sentencing to death around 700 Morsi supporters after a speedy mass trial, accusing them of murder and attempted murder of policemen in August last year in Minya.
