
Israel is portrayed widely as a racist and oppressive nation that arbitrarily inflicts only harm on its enemies. But the Israeli soldiers manning the IDF field hospital on the Israel-Syria border continue to prove the opposite.

Earlier this month, IDF paramedic Noga Erez received the President’s Award of Excellence for her role in leading military medical staff in daily providing life-saving assistance to those injured in Syria’s ongoing civil war.

Syria is officially at war with Israel and harbors and facilitates numerous anti-Israel terror groups. Most Syrians are raised to view Israel as a hated and bloodthirsty enemy.

But none of that will deter Erez and her medics from aiding those in need.

Like so many others serving in the area, Erez is proud of the humanitarian assistance she provides to Israel’s enemies, she is proud of showing a very different face of Israel than the one the media and other propagandists try to portray.
