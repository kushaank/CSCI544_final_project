JONESBORO, AR (KAIT) – A Monette man wanted surf and turf for dinner; but, Jonesboro police say he didn't want to pay for it.

Jeremiah Chad Holland, 28, of Monette was arrested Sunday afternoon on shoplifting charges after he reportedly stole steak and shrimp from Kroger, 1525 S. Caraway.

The store manager told police he observed Holland get the items from the meat department.

According to the initial police report, Holland placed one package of meat in his boot and the other in his pants.

He then picked up another item and checked out. The store manager said Holland did not pay for the hidden items.

Officer Christopher Jefferson was called to the store and took Holland into custody.

As he was walking Holland to his patrol car, Jefferson said Holland's girlfriend, 21-year-old Meghan Rae Vance of Monette, approached him.

Jefferson ran Vance's information through dispatch and discovered she was wanted on a Craighead County bench warrant for violating the state's hot check law.

Jefferson arrested Vance and transported her along with Holland to the Craighead County Sheriff's Office.

Holland was charged with theft of property less than $1,000. His bond was set at $770.

Vance's bond was set at $1,500 and she was ordered to appear in Circuit Court on June 30.

Both are free on bond.
