
Daniel Wadi remains in Khartoum in the hope of appealing his wife's death sentence.

According to a Sudanese court, that made Ibrahim Muslim under the law.

The court convicted her of apostasy and adultery (since Muslim women in Sudan are not permitted to marry men outside their faith)* under Sharia law and sentenced her 100 lashes and death by hanging .  She had until Thursday to renounce her faith.  She refused.

Meanwhile Wani’s brother, Gabriel, remains in Manchester .  He says Daniel plans to appeal the ruling, but is concerned about leaving his family home in Khartoum.

“The last time I talked to him yesterday, he said, ‘Oh, some people are watching the house,’”  he says.  Gabriel says the surveillance has spooked Daniel, who is now seeking protection from the U.S. government.

*Muslim men in the country are allowed to marry non-Muslim women.
