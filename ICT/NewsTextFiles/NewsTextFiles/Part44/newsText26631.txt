
KEENE — Peace Corps acting director Carrie Hessler-Radelet encouraged Antioch University New England graduates to cultivate relationships, explore the world, and find a way to serve, in her keynote speech at Antioch’s commencement ceremony Saturday.

She shared stories of returned Peace Corps volunteers now receiving graduate degrees, and highlighted the value of service as a training ground and launching pad for a 21st-century career.

Hessler-Radelet also compared Antioch to the Peace Corps, saying they are both dedicated to igniting global change by translating knowledge and understanding into action that makes a difference in the world.

She urged graduates to continue hands-on learning and seeking answers for themselves.

During her visit to New Hampshire, Hessler-Radelet and AUNE President Dr. Stephen Jones expanded the organizations’ partnership through a new agreement to launch a Peace Corps Master’s International program at the University.

Students in the new program will have the opportunity to integrate Peace Corps service with a master’s degree in environmental studies.

“The Peace Corps and Antioch share a lot of values, a commitment to social and environmental justice, an interest in nurturing global citizens and a commitment to service,” she said in a phone interview Friday. One hundred thirty-eight graduates received diplomas at Antioch University New England commencement held at the Keene Middle School Saturday.
