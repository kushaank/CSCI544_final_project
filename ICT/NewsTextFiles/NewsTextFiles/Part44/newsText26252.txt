
The Pentagon announced that it has not seen any evidence of Russian military forces retreating from the country’s border with the Ukraine, as reported in a message from the Kremlin.

“We have seen reports that President Putin instructed his forces to retreat from the Ukrainian border. If these reports are indeed correct, such a retreat is a blessing. We have not seen any indication of any movement, whatsoever,” American sources proclaimed.
