HARGEISA (Somalilandsun)- Communal elders from Mogadishu who have been traversing every corner of the country in the recent past have ultimately given the green light in recognizing the autonomy of Somaliland in a bid meant to attract the attention of international community.

This comes after witnessing the commemorations marking the 23 years of self Governance devoid of intrusions from its former partner in the annulled union.

The elders were positioned on the left periphery of the president during the event that immeasurably left an impression of patriotic & nationalistic citizenry eager to take their nation to greater heights if the turnout for the D-day is anything to go by.

Sultan Abdiaziz Omar Daad, one of elders who participated in the celebrations with national leadership at the entrance of the presidency in Hargeisa on Sunday 18th May was optimistic that his brothers that once formed part of the "Greater Somalia" have attained marvelous progress that calls for recognition of their statehood.

In briefing press members afterwards, Sultan Daad was convinced beyond doubt that the administration in Hargeisa merited to be recognized by traditional community leadership from Somalia.

When asked the magnitude & worthiness of the elders' certification yet not being Government officials, Sultan Daad insisted that elders undertake such enormous responsibilities posing,

"Why go after people who have decided their destiny?"

Similar sentiments were echoed by Sultan Ahmed Mohamed Barre, a delegation team member with Sultan Daad who concurred with him that the people & Government of Somaliland have resolved to take a common approach from the onset through formation of functioning Government from grassroots hence would not hesitate in recommending for their recognition.

Over 70 traditional elders from Somalia came to the country two weeks ago in two different phases where they met national leaders in additional to engaging private sector as well as analysis state protocol and the modus operandi of state departments that immensely electrified them.

More people in Somalia believe in a TWO state solution THEN the number of people who believe in genuine UNITY. Unity is a sales slogan used by politicians who wish to defraud the public and international community SHABAB is the biggest supporter of UNITY.

It goes without saying the Majority in Somaliland believe in a TWO state solution. The Minority Unionist are mostly politically driven and have no genuine believe in unity, they see unity as a tool to achieve their end goals.

Only Terrorists and Co0pt politicians employ unionist sentiments.

Let us be honest with ourselves UNITY has been exploited since 1960, it has been abused and misused to the point the average person dis0sts the notion of Unity.

Say Unity(Midnimo) and you will be half way to being ridiculed and considered a character without integrity.

- Galmudug Elders and residents are pro TWO-STATE solution.

- Juba Elders are pro-TWO-State solution.

- Gedo elders are pro-TWO-State solution.

- Bay & Bakool Elders are pro-TWO-State solution.

- Shabelle Elders are Pro-TWO-State solution.

- Hiraan Elders are Pro-TWO-State solution.

- Muuqdisho is sensitive to the needs of appeasing only a minority of people who are promoting the fraud of UNITY when there has been no UNITY for 23-years. That is even longer then the 21-years Siyad Barre was in charge.

Mr Kay is the BOQOR in Muuqdisho and 2.8billion promised funds on their way. Muuqdisho will be forever policed by non-Somalis making the most peaceful city in Africa. They will build schools, courts and hospitals. This will mean top foreign education, Gay rights in Muuqdisho and endless medical experiments to advance human kind.

We want UNITY because the Somalilanders will benefit becoming more like us. We in koonfur have a lot to offer, we have 20% Bantu population, we have two rivers supplying water from Ethiopia, we have Kenya protecting our oceans and skies. We want to share the 23K soldiers from AU dictatorship states with presidents wanted by the hague.

You are idiot not knowing that Somalia in Foreign hands and that you are just delusional not to understand what is going on your own country because you are too obsessed with Somaliland and what Somaliland is doing.

Waxa dhaw wakhtigii webiyada laydinkaga talaabi jiray!

I'll say it plain and simple 0 YOU.

"...Somali-land is still pretty much in Somalia..." Are you saying Somaliland is in Somalia? Well you must be retarded or you must have been in a coma and just woke up from it!

we have reconised Somaliland becouse they have feedom, peace, development, unity and strong security.

mash'Allah O Allah Bless the people of Somaliland.

You are not realistic .

Normal man even in Haragissa , feel if the Somalis failed in common Western Style should go back to the original Somali system of govern .

Somaliland Has created the somali unity and now they decide to go back so you don't judge them to do what they want.

The Igad Countries spearheaded by Ethiopia, the AU HQs in Addisababa and the wider IC@UN should address the Somaliland quest for a pro two state solution as commented by Caydiid in the interests of everlasting real peace in the Horn-E.A et beyond. All other trajactory trends end up in futile dead ends.T r u s t me folks.

cheers.

please help me I think I am lost again in the woods.

Hello does anyone hear me? I'm still in the woods.

@Anti Zion,

cheers.

Not to worry...The EPRDF knows that the Somaliland is no jokes like the failed Somalia. Ethiopia is part of the Western world big interest corporates.

However, the GOSL under the wise neutral leadership of HE President DR Ahmed Silaanyo takes no chances and in contact allover which sooner would result in full recognition...n othing less.The EPRDF is for sure a good ally that has the tools to act. What's happening with the USA side? That Mercury lobbists.

cheers.

cheers.

Never ever 0st walaweyn again. These elderly Hawiye men are here for a reason. I believe that they did not just show up at Airport and said we want to talk. There must be a prior arrangements with the Siilaanyo Administration. And Siilaanyo government is keeping us in the dark! We Somalilanders want why these people are here and what they want. Are they here to learn something from Somalilanders or are they here to invite us to be back to re-united with them again. We Somalilanders deserve a clear cut answer from Siilaanyo Administration, period!

- 1960 - 1969 only 30% political representation.

- 1960 - 1969 only 10% development projects.

- 1969 - 1991 - Charged for UNION membership. 100% of GDP of Somaliland was taken by dictatorship. r 0>- 1969 - 1991 - The cost to live goes beyond the acknowledged 50,000. There more 100times more who died of indirect effects of migration and the complete bombardment of Somaliland cities.

- 1969 - 1991 - The des0ction inflicted upon Hargeisa alone is unimaginable. The city was occupied by 250,000 people by rough estimate, with countless nomadic people traveling to acquire their supplies and selling their live stock in the destroyed cities.

Awaiting proof!

Please take a moment to refresh your minds and stop this ignorant argument! I would like you all to weigh and consider the following points calmly and let them sink into your burnt out brains.

5. Before going too far, do you all know what awaits us? A dark grave and the Day of Judgement. Places where everyone is accountable only to the Creator and no dirty, tribalist and useless politics are put into consideration? Please be aware of this point and the negative influence it will have on your Hereafter before you place your fingers on the keyboard for commenting.

You're so right my brother this dunya is temporary we all gone face our creator.

Our principle is too see Somalia united because we are Muslims but they are some people in north who follow kafir beliefs.

Mohamed cheers belongs to the world of Monotheism...in cluding the special Monotheistic divine powers connected to his birthright(Jesu s) and also his resurrection with other entirely different rank powers connected to a different generation of entirely a different world from his past. I believe that my friend Jesus is a human being monotheist with special super powers like Adam, Moses, Noah, Abraham, Mohamed and all the monotheist prophets of the one Holy Almighty God of Mother Nature of here and hereafter. Despite Religious ideological differences...a ll Religions belief that Jesus would0le the World of Armageddon before the doomsday. The Monotheism belief that the Kingdom of Jesus would be theirs. Therefore being a monotheist myself, I believe that Jesus is my friend and not my enemy.

cheers.

cheers.

mohamed cheers what are you talking about? Īsā had no superpowers miracles are given to prophets only when Allah wants.

You want to divide muslims into christian borders which is wrong under Islam all Muslims know that the value and importance of uniting the Muslims.

We want to divide from fake people who pretend to be Muslims and who pretend to be Somalis and pretend to be peaceful.

long live Somaliland.
