
Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Monday invited India’s Prime Minister-designate Narendra Modi to visit the country and expressed the hope of raising the bilateral partnership to new heights.

In a letter, Mr Lee congratulated Mr Modi for his win in the Lok Sabha elections.

“On behalf of the Government and people of Singapore, I congratulate you on your election as India’s Prime Minister.

The BJP’s decisive victory reflects the strong support and great hopes that Indian voters have in your leadership and vision,” he wrote.

Noting that the two countries cooperate closely to promote regional peace and prosperity through multinational forums, Mr Lee highlighted that next year the two nations will celebrate 50 years of diplomatic relations.

“It is an auspicious milestone which I hope can be a springboard to raise our bilateral partnership to new heights.

I look forward to working with you to enhance our bilateral ties and hope that you will visit Singapore at the earliest opportunity,” Mr Lee said.

“I wish you every success in your new appointment,” he said.

Former premier Goh Chok Tong also sent a letter to Mr Modi, expressing his “heartiest congratulations” on his electoral victory.

“You have always shown a strong resolve to bring economic prosperity to the Indian people. Gujarat’s economic success and development are testament of your visionary leadership and what you can bring to India,” Mr Goh, who currently is Emeritus Senior Minister in the government, wrote.
