
There are grave concerns for the safety of the 700 residents of Nanongbong village in north-eastern Thailand, after it was attacked by at least 100 unidentified armed men on 15 May. Some of the villagers were assaulted and detained for around six hours during the incident. It is believed that the attack is connected to opposition to the planned expansion of a local gold mine.
