
Coronation Street star Krissi Bohn will leave the soap this summer.

The 31-year-old actress has played taxi-driver Lloyd Mullaney's daughter Jenna Kamara since joining the ITV soap two years ago, but ITV bosses have now decided to axe her character.

She added: "Thankful for the people I've met and experience I've gained! What a great (almost) 2 years! cheers @Iitvcorrie."

Krissi - whose only other television role was an appearance in Law and Order: UK in 2010 - has enjoyed a number of storylines on the street, including a lesbian relationship with Sophie Webster.

More recently Jenna has been seen trying to protect her father Lloyd from his new girlfriend Andrea (Hayley Tamaddon).

Coronation Street boss Stuart Blackburn said: "Krissi has played a key role in some fantastic stories."

Krissi's departure will come as the soap prepares to welcome Kal Nazir's (Jimi Mistry) mother Yasmeen and her teenage son Zeedan to the famous cobbles this summer.
