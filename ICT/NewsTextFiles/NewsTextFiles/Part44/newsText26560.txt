
Thailand’s army, after months of political turmoil, on Tuesday morning imposed martial law nationwide “to restore peace and order” after protests against the government, but it was always pronounced the military action was not underway.

Army has declared the move is not a martial law and people should not be concerned, Army Chief said on local TV channel. He said the military was attempting merely to restore law and order situation and other things in order. Army Chief asked all the groups to halt their protests.

Bangkok, the capital, is flooded with soldiers and they can be seen on every street, although no curfew had been inflicted. They have occupied almost all the private television stations.

Early Tuesday the army chief, Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha signed a statement, which stated that “ongoing political rallies could impact the country’s security and safety of the lives and properties of the public”.

Since 2006, this move is military’s direct involvement whereas Martial law is already prevailing in parts of southern Thailand.

It is an 11th successful coup in Thailand since 1932.
