
After days of heavy rains, swaths of Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina are underwater. Parts of the countries saw as much rain fall in 40 hours as they normally get in three months, officials said. Authorities said over 37 people have died as a result of the flooding.

Soldiers, police and volunteers battled to protect power plants in Serbia from rising flood waters on Sunday, May 18 as the death toll from the Balkan region's worst rainfall in more than a century rose to at least 37.
