
At the Economic Ministers' conference in Qingdao on Saturday, China again pushed for the Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific Region (FTAAP). Taiwan's Minister Chang Chia-chu (å¼µå®¶ç¥�) expressed the nation's positive appraisal of the project, which has been talked about for ten years.

This is a reminder to Taiwan to keep focusing some of its attention on the higher stakes of economic integration. Coming at a time when society is just recovering from turmoil over the cross-strait services pact, the FTAAP discussion asks the nation to focus its efforts on marshalling resources to build bilateral economic agreements wherever possible.

Protecting industries from Free Trade Economic Pilot Zones (FTEPZ), as DPP legislators tried to do this week, may be a short-term political reaction provoked by the recoil over the services pact, but eventually painful decisions about opening up the labor market will have to be made in exchange for trade agreements. Granting partners access to different sectors of the labor market is an unavoidable issue.

The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) has run into problems between the United States and Japan, with the latter's agricultural industry fighting tooth and nail for its coveted protections. The TPP does not include China, and is obviously part of the U.S. strategy to counterbalance the country's rise. China has set out the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and Chinese premier Li Keqiang claimed at the Boao Forum last month that the RCEP is a framework more respectful of national priorities and therefore easier to embrace.

Yet the long-term dream of an integrated economic free trade zone for Asia must be thought of not as a panacea for the problem of Taiwan falling behind the pace of liberalization. Rather, Taiwan should be concentrating its efforts on continuing to establish areas of cooperation while recognizing the difficulties that exist when attempting to sign deals with countries that have different priorities.

The example of Japan's efforts and its success in building a regional free trade agreement with ASEAN can be an example to emulate. In a 2009 report by the Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research, Japan's Agreement on Comprehensive Economic Partnership with ASEAN came about as the result of breaking down pieces of the regional puzzle through successive bilateral deals with six ASEAN countries.

The political motivations of big global players in the competition for influence, chiefly the U.S. and China, are obvious, but for a smaller player like Taiwan, it is important above all to maintain momentum in incorporating new bilateral deals with different countries. When enough pieces are filled in, the wheel of multiplied economic integration will turn, much like the example of Japan in its approach to ASEAN.

The signing of Taiwan's agreement with Singapore, ASTEP, affirmed a mutual agreement to reduce bilateral tariffs by more than 99 percent on the Taiwan side and 100 percent on the Singapore side, and the estimated economic benefits could be as large as US$782 million, Minister Chang was quoted as saying in November last year by Nikkei News.

Chinese premier Li pointed out at the Boao Forum in April that the interdependency of Asian nations is borne out by the increase in the percentage of inter-regional trade in total trade volume, now at more than 50 percent.

Taiwan must redouble its efforts to participate in and share in the fruits of this blossoming network of economic relations. Consistent and unwavering efforts to approach our potential partners, one at a time, will yield bigger results down the road. While staying aware of the political implications of great powers, Taiwan should not worry too much about taking sides. Rather, there is still much Taiwan can and must do to avail itself of the opportunities in front of us, and that requires crafting the puzzles one piece at a time.
