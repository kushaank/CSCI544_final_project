
WESTMINSTER, SC (WHNS) – A dog roaming a large wooded area in Oconee County, South Carolina with a metal pipe stuck on its head is free of the ductwork Monday morning, according to residents in the area.

“Piper” is a feral dog that has been seen roaming the area for a week, unable to get water easily or eat because of the pipe stuck on its head.

Volunteers with Upstate Animal Rescue Foundation, local veterinarians and animal control officers worked for days to set traps to catch Piper, who is afraid of people and would run off into the woods when anyone would get within dozens of yards of him.

Rescuers said they could not get close enough to Piper to shoot him with a tranquilizer gun without him running off.

Neighbors said they could see Piper on Monday morning running around with a steak in his mouth. Oconee County Animal Control officers are working to confirm the dog spotted with the steak is Piper.

Upstate Animal Rescue posted on Facebook they are optimistic he will be OK.

It is not known how the pipe was removed from his head.
