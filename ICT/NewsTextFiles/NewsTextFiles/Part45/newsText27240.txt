
Following racist comments made about President Barack Obama, former 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney is calling for New Hampshire Police Commissioner Robert Copeland to resign, according to USA TODAY.

The remarks were made public after a New Hampshire resident, Jane O'Toole, claimed to overhear him use a racial slur.

Romney owns a home in Wolfeboro, where he spends summers with his family.

State Sen. Jeb Bradley, a Wolfeboro Republican, told the Herald that Copeland, a friend of the family, should "really apologize."

"People around New England and around the United States should not look at the remarks of one person, who is refusing to resign so far, as indicative of how anyone else of Wolfeboro thinks," Bradley said.

"He can disagree with President Obama all he wants, but it's not right whether it's the president of the United States or any other American to be called what he was called. It's offensive."
