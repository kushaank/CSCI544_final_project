
According to KTLA News on May 19, no one is sure why these thousands of fish have met their demise, but some theories have evolved.  The fish started to wash up in the corner of the marina on Saturday, which is an area of the marina near Bora Bora Way. The top theory is that the fish became to plentiful in one area of the water and used up all the oxygen, which caused their own suffocation.

The huge amount of dead fish floating on the water prompted a clean-up on Sunday. The Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors estimate 3,000 to 4,000 fish carcasses were removed, but more appeared. The clean-up effort is over and the thousands of remaining fish will either be eaten by natural predators or hopefully float back out to sea and disperse, according to NBC Local News .

One of the theories of this fish die-off is that there were so many, that the fish depleted all the oxygen in the area of the water where they congregated. The anchovies came in and the other fish followed saturating the marina and taking up all the oxygen in the water, this theory is offered by a marine expert.

This is the same theory that was applied to another fish die-off in 2011. Back then it was millions of fish blanketing the shore front of King Harbor in Redondo Beach. The fish were believed to have suffocated, much like the theory of the dead fish found over the weekend in Marina del Rey.
