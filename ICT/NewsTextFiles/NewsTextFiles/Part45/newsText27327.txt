
Mixologist Molly Wellmann is planning something new for her next downtown Cincinnati location.

M. Wellmannâ€™s Brands, which owns Jappâ€™s, Neonâ€™s and Old Kentucky Bourbon Bar, will open The Hearth Room at 127 W. Fourth St. The former Twist Lounge will house a rentable event space where Wellmannâ€™s signature cocktails will be served.

Set to open this fall, the new space will be available for private events of up to 140 people.

The company is partnering with Jeff McClorey of home dÃ©cor retailer Bromwellâ€™s and the space will include one of its fireplaces.
