From Alaska, to Canada, then on to its final destination, the US. To cross the Bering Strait will require approximately 200km of undersea tunnel.

200 kilometers of undersea tunnel.Talk about ambitious! In fact it's an order of magnitude more ambitious than anything that's been done before. As the Telegraph informs , the longest undersea tunnel currently in operation is the Seikan Tunnel in Japan at 33.5 miles.

China...announced plans this month to bid for contracts to build developing high-speed rails in the U.S.. According to Deputy Railway Minister Wang Zhiguo, 'China is willing to share its mature and advanced technology with other countries to promote development of the world's high-speed railways.'
