Nevada's first significant wildfire of the 2014 season is burning near Reno as crews are attempting to conquer a blaze that they believe will be fully contained by Friday.

Crews are getting the upper hand on the wildfire, pushing it back into the rugged wilderness along the Sierra's eastern front. About 250 firefighters remain at the site of the blaze, and began mop-up work Wednesday around the fire's old perimeter.

Cooler temperatures and precipitation have arrived in the region, which had gone more than four weeks without any significant rainfall.

"Reno hasn't picked up a decent, soaking rain in almost four weeks. This isn't unusual, as average rainfall in May is only 0.49 inches," said weather.com senior meteorologist Jon Erdman . "Unlike fire-fatigued San Diego County, there is good weather news ahead for this Reno wildfire. A decent chance of thunderstorms producing rain at the ground (not dry thunderstorms with only lightning and shifting winds) is in play, particularly on Tuesday. Cooler temperatures and higher humidity will also help."

The fire is estimated to be at 65 percent containment, and that number is expected to rise later Wednesday. No homes are in danger and no major injuries have been reported, although one firefighter suffered a minor eye injury, said Elizabeth Kenna, spokeswoman for the Sierra Front Interagency Dispatch Center. Fire suppression costs are approaching $500,000.

"When rain comes down, it makes everything really slick," he told KRNV-TV. "You've got to watch out for your footing. You could have a chance of more rolling material."

The cause of the fire remains under investigation. Fire officials say it likely was human-caused because there was no lightning in the area when it was reported about 11 p.m. Saturday.
