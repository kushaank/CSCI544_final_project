
HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (WSAZ) -- A man pleaded guilty to federal drug charges Monday in connection with a major federal investigation in Huntington.

Brandon Appleton, 25, of Rand, pleaded guilty to possession cocaine, and MDMA, also known as Ecstasy, with the intent to distribute them.

The DEA searched a home in the 1800 block of Artisan Avenue in Huntington in January 2014.

The home belonged to Kenneth Dewitt Newton, also known as "K-Kutta", who was under federal investigation for drug trafficking.

Appleton was at the home during the search and was in possession of a sandwich-style bag that contained smaller bags of Ecstasy and cocaine, which he intended to sell.

Investigators say Appleton distributed drugs for Newman from December 2013 until the January search.

Additional amounts of cocaine and MDMA, as well as heroin, marijuana, and prescription pills, were seized in the residence. As a result of the investigation, Newman and 14 other individuals were charged with various offenses related to a drug trafficking conspiracy in the Huntington area.

Appleton faces up to 20 years in prison, and a $1 million fine when he is sentenced in August.
