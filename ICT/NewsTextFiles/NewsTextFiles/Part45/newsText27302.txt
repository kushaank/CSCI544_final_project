
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) â€” Lance Armstrong has been ordered to give sworn videotaped testimony next month about using performance-enhancing drugs to win the Tour de France seven times.

Armstrong has been sued by a Texas company seeking the return of about $12 million in performance bonuses. An arbitration panel has issued subpoenas for testimony from Armstrong on June 12 and his longtime business manager Bill Stapleton on June 9.

The cyclist has asked the Texas Supreme Court to intervene. He says a previous settlement with SCA Promotions is binding and cannot be reopened.

Armstrong's attorneys noted the subpoenas in a request for the Supreme Court to rule quickly.

Armstrong provided written sworn testimony last year in an unrelated lawsuit, and for the first time provided names of those he says assisted in his doping.
