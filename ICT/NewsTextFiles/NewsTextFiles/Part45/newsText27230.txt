
I would like to thank Kathleen Anderson for calling my attention to Joni Ernst in her letter to the editor of May 17. Joni Ernst is running for the Senate seat to be vacated by Senator Tom Harkin when he retires. I believe Kathleen was referring to two ads run by the Ernst campaign. The "castration" add tells how Joni grew up on a hog farm so she'll know how to cut pork when she gets to D.C. The add showing what Kathleen describes as a "pistol packin mama" tells how Joni will take aim at Obamacare when she goes to Washington. They're brilliant ads and, in my opinion, amusing.

I think Joni Ernst would be a great candidate and I would urge everyone to read her bio.

In an article just under Kathleen's letter, Leonard Pitts, no friend of the Republicans, writes how President Obama's Attorney General, Eric Holder, will not prosecute any of the wealthy crooks who were responsible for our economic meltdown. Also, on page 6A of that same Journal is a report that the Iowa Supreme Court ruled that a Republican State Senator can't sue the Iowa Democratic Party or their Democratic candidate for making false accusations that the Republican Senator sold dangerous drugs to children. I guess negative campaigning is good to go with the Iowa Supreme Court.
