
Within the branches of the 194-year-old Kamani tree that towers over the corners of Haili and Ululani streets are many stories.

For Mary K. Namahoe, 85, it’s a tale of her childhood, youth, religion and community.

Namahoe’s father, Steve Descha Jr., and grandfather, Steve Descha Sr., were preachers at the mid-19th century Greek-revival church known today as the Haili Congregational Church. It also happens to be one of Hilo’s oldest churches.

From 1906-44, the church sponsored a weekly Hawaiian newspaper, Ka Ho Ku O Hawaii, printed every Thursday.

Namahoe, a young girl in those days, said her cousin’s plan to make some quick cash off the paper failed miserably.

Namahoe paused to laugh and look toward the tree before continuing.

“So, my dad got really upset and asked my cousin what happened and he pointed to me! I said I didn’t do anything!” she said with a laugh.

Namahoe had plans with friends that day but she canceled them to visit the church to watch the ancient tree get a little bit of a face-lift Friday.

Church member Kelsey Bufil said the tree was in desperate need of maintenance as its branches were projecting halfway across Haili Street and putting stress on above power lines.

“Last year was the worst year. The leaves and the nuts…Oh my! They were everywhere!” she said.

But in order to cut off a few branches from a 194-year-old tree that is part of a national historic tree registry, the church’s board of trustees had to jump a few hurdles.

Finally, the board received approval and employees of Tree Works Inc., a tree trimming, pruning and removal company based in Papaikou certified to perform work on historic trees, worked to remove the debris and appendages while Bufil, Namahoe and others stood by to reflect on and appreciate the tree’s natural beauty.

For Bufil, the tree reminds him of his childhood.

“Now, it’s taken on an even bigger significance.
