
Zoning changes will soon be coming to Watertown, though for some they cannot come soon enough.

Monday night, the Town Council�s Economic Development and Planning Subcommittee took steps toward approving the Comprehensive Plan - the planning document that will guide the future development of the town - as well as taking a big step toward changing the zoning for the Pleasant Street Corridor in the West End of town.

The Comprehensive Plan covers a wide array of areas, with zoning and development just one part of it. There are visions for different sections of town and townwide goals for public transportation, bicycle and pedestrian matters, parks, and other areas.

Councilors said they want to balance the goal of completing the plan so it can be put into effect, with residents desire to review and comment on the document. Council Vice President Steve Corbett, chairman of the subcommittee, said the plan is not an easy read."

I tried to go through it in a day and a half and I couldn�t,"Corbett said. "There is a lot in there."

Watertown Community Development and Planning Director Steve Magoon suggested that the plan go to town department heads for comment before going out to the public, but Councilor Susan Falkoff said she didn�t like that idea."

I don�t think there should be another draft and review before the public gets to see it,"Falkoff said. "I want (the process) to be open. The public is here and is interested."

Instead of sending the whole Comprehensive Plan to the Town Council to review, Corbett suggested having some sort of working group, possibly the Economic Development and Planning subcommittee, go through the document section by section to give recommendations. Councilor Vincent Piccirilli agreed.

"It is 30 pages with hundreds of recommendations. Somebody need to go through it and flag things that don�t make sense or need work,"Piccirilli said. "The last thing we want is to approve it and a year later say, �Where did that come from?�"

Page 2 of 2 - Before the Comprehensive Plan takes effect, the subcommittee seeks to make zoning changes in the Pleasant Street Corridor - the area in the West End of town where unused or under used parcels are being redeveloped. So far, almost every development in the area has been large apartment or condominium complex.

Magoon presented a draft of changes that would split the Pleasant Street Corridor into three different types of zoning - PSCD2 which would allow residential projects, but 25 percent of the gross floor area would have to be commercial space, PSCD3 where a mix of retail, commercial and light industrial is allowed but no residential space, and PSCD1 which can have any type of development allowed in the Pleasant Street Corridor.

The zoning would also change to require buildings to be stepped back if they are taller than two stories. Floors above the second must be pushed 15 feet back from the front facade, and above six floors must be pushed back 25 feet from the front facade.

Any new residential project must be built 15 feet from the property line - five more feet that the current zoning. The step back also applies to the back of the building if it is on the Charles River. Any stories over the second will be pushed back 15 feet.

Councilors are eager to put the new zoning into place on Pleasant Street. Magoon said that a project that came in before the zoning changes became official would not have to comply with the changes. By having the first reading at the Town Council, the new zoning would be put into the official record and would have to be considered by developers and town boards, Magoon said.

Rather than having another public hearing at the Planning Board to review the zoning changes, the subcommittee voted to send it to the Town Council for a first reading at the May 27 meeting. Because of the schedule of Planning Board meetings, the next time it could go to the Town Council after the Planning Board reviewed it would be June 24.

"There are always developments in the wings,"Magoon said. "I would not be surprised if another project is submitted before June 24."

The changes to the Pleasant Street Corridor will be looked at by the Town Council on May 27, and then can be reviewed by the Planning Board before going back for final approval by the Town Council.
