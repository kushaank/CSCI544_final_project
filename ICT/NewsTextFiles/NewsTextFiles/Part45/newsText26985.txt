
According to the Arizona Daily Star , 1st Congressional District candidate Gary Kiehne addressed his stance on the Second Amendment during Saturday’s Republican primary debate.

In the same debate, one of Kiehne’s competitors, Adam Kwasman, described himself as “100 percent pro gun rights.” The Arizona House of Representatives member said that gun ownership is a “God given natural right” while poking fun at himself as “the worst duck hunter you have ever met.” Kwasman tied his views on gun rights to his Jewish background, saying that in World War II, guns were one of the first things to be taken away from citizens by the Nazis.

Republican candidate Andy Tobin did not attend the debate.
