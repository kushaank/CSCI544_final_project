
Nasal strips won’t keep California Chrome from possibly making history next month.

He’s worn them when he won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness but until Monday, nasal strips were banned in New York State, where the final event in the Triple Crown is held.

New York tracks prohibit any equipment not specially approved by stewards and nasal strips were not on that list.

California Chrome’s trainer said his owners had warned he might not race if he couldn’t wear the strips.

Back in 2012, I’ll Have Another faced a similar issue.  He was a contender for the Triple Crown and had to get his nasal strip approved.  That issue was never resolved because of a career-ending leg injury that prevented him from running in the race.

California Chrome could be the first horse in 36 years to win the Triple Crown.
