
SOUTHPORT, CT, May 20, 2014     /- DiversityBusiness.com today announced the inaugural     launch of its “National Entrepreneurship Initiative” (NEI) campaign.     NEI’s mission is to encourage, motivate and educate individuals     about the opportunities and rewards of being an entrepreneur. NEI’s     mission is also to promote the success of America’s top privately     owned businesses.

Since  2000, through rigorous research, data collection and analysis,  DiversityBusiness.com has identified the most successful companies in the United  States.  These efforts have allowed DiversityBusiness.com to recognize the  leading entrepreneurs throughout the country.

Every large company started out as a small company.  Every small company was started  by someone who was inspired and motivated to give entrepreneurship a try.  But  not every American has a role model whose path they can follow.  The purpose in  recognizing these top companies and showcasing their success through the  National Entrepreneurship Initiative is to make sure that every potential  American entrepreneur gets the inspiration they need to fulfill their dreams.

We can  reinvigorate our country’s competitive spirit of being economically  self-sufficient, which has been a core American value throughout our rich  history. The ball is now in our court to leave a lasting mark for future  generations.  All it takes is one news story, one encouraging quote, one  interview, one picture to make all the difference in someone’s life to believe  that they, too, can own their own business.
