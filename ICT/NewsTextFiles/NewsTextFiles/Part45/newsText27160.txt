LONGMEADOW - A memorial service to celebrate local residents who have given their time and effort to serve in the military and to remember those who were killed while serving their country was held as part of the Long Meddowe Days festivities Sunday.

The heart of the service was a reading of the names of the fallen, grouped by the conflict in which they fought.

A number of speakers, including State Rep. Brian Ashe, D-Longmeadow, and Longmeadow Select Board Chairman Marie Angelides , also offered their thoughts on the solemn occasion. A moment of silence was held, and a memorial wreath was brought forward.

To cap the service, members of the 9th Massachusetts Light Infantry Battalion offered a multi-gun salute, their trumpeter played a rendition of “Taps,” and the American flag was raised high above the proceedings.

“Today, we remember the 53 times the hearts of the community of Longmeadow were broken. This is our family, our history, and their sacrifices have given us the peace and freedom we enjoy today,” Angelides said.

The service was sponsored by the Longmeadow Veterans' Circle.
