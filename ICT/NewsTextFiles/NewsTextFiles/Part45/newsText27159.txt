
One of the oldest Boy Scout troops in the United States celebrated their 90th anniversary on Sunday afternoon.

Boy Scout Troop 32 gathered at Temple Beth El for a celebratory diner to commemorate its legacy for youth since 1924.

Sunday's event featured traditional Boy Scout ceremonies, a display of historic Troop 32 memorabilia and a silent auction.

The troop's leader said programs like the Boy Scouts can teach important life lessons to the children.

"It's getting the kids out there, it's getting the boys out there to do things on their own with kids their own age, as opposed to just hanging around at home not doing much of anything," said James Dowd, scout master of the troop. "[There are] a lot of just basic life lessons you learn that you practice every day in scouting."

Tickets for the event were $10.

Alumni of the troop and their families were invited to attend.
