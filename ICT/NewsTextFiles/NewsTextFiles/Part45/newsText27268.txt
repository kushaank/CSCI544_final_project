
'California Chrome,' the horse that has won this year's Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, may not get the opportunity to win the triple crown.

A state rule in New York forbidding horses to wear nasal strips could force the horse out of the June 7 Belmont Stakes and end the chestnut colt's chance at winning the sport's first winner take all since 1978.

California Chrome will need the approval of Belmont Park's three stewards to wear the nasal strip he used during his winning rides in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes.

On Sunday, the connections of the horse made an official appeal to the stewards, who were considering it, according to the New York State Gaming Commission.
