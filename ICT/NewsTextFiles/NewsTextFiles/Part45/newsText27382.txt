A conservative advocacy group says protesters of North Carolina Republican policies should take note of an improved state economy and fiscal picture before demonstrating further against the Republican agenda.

The organization called Carolina Rising held a news conference Monday in front of the Legislative Building as participants in this year's first "Moral Monday" protest during the legislative session filed into downtown.

Carolina Rising President Dallas Woodhouse asked whether protesters wanted to return to Democratic rule in Raleigh a few years ago. He says the state unemployment rate has fallen more than four percentage points since Republicans took over the General Assembly in 2011. He credits tax and unemployment insurance system overhauls since Gov. Pat McCrory took office with helping accelerate business confidence and job creation.

Critics disagree with the assessment.
