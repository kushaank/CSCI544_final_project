
That might not be as most people perceived it, though. Few paid much attention to the two guys — incumbent C.L. “Butch” Otter and challenger Russ Fulcher — who have an actual chance to win. The many, many, many collections of video clips on the web in the hours and days after the debate overwhelmingly focused on the other two, Harley Brown and Walt Bayes.

You can watch it on the Idaho Public Television web site. Go ahead. You won’t be bored.

Afterward, you might reflect on how little the debate had to do with the decision that voters in the Republican primary Tuesday will be making, which as a practical matter will be between Otter and Fulcher, either of whom might win. Brown will not. He is a perennial sliver candidate, running for U.S. House in 2010 (he got 3.9 percent of the vote) and 2000 (1.1 percent, losing to Otter) and Boise mayor in 2001 (3 percent) among a string of other offices. Bayes will not either: He ran, highly unsuccessfully, for governor in 2010 (3 percent) and 2006 (3.2 percent) and 2002 (4.7 percent).

They have every right to run. (For Brown, president may well be next.) That doesn’t obligate debate organizers to give them a megaphone, or half of the air time in the lone exchange between the candidates who really may be running Idaho government for the next four years.

They can take their pick.
