
TEHRAN (FNA)- Manchester United midfielder Ryan Giggs pulled down the curtain on a 23-year playing career by announcing his retirement as he becomes new manager's Louis van Gaal's assistant.

Giggs played a club record 963 matches for United since making his debut in March 1991, scoring 168 goals. Prior to the 2013-14 campaign he had scored in every Premier League season since its inception in 1992, Goal reported.

He ended the most recent campaign as the club's caretaker manager following the sacking of David Moyes, and bid farewell to Old Trafford against Hull City after substituting himself on for the final 20 minutes.

"I am immensely proud, honoured and fortunate to have represented the biggest club in the world 963 times and Wales 64 times," Giggs told the club's official website.

"My dream was always to play for Manchester United, and although it saddens me to know I wonâ€™t be pulling on a United jersey again as a player, I have been lucky enough to have fulfilled that dream," he added.

The 40-year-old was an integral part of United's finest years under Sir Alex Ferguson, from the first Premier League title in 1993 to the most recent in 2013, via the 1999 treble and Champions League triumph in 2008.

The Welshman, who represented his country 64 times, was awarded a testimonial in 2001 to commemorate 10 years of service at Old Trafford.
