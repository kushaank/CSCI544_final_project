America isn’t as young as it once was. By 2030 approximately one-fifth of the US population will be over the age of 65. As the population continues to age, descriptions such as “elderly” or “senior” can be found offensive.

People are living longer, but don’t want to be labeled as old. According to NPR’s Ina Jaffe, terms like “silver tsunami,” “senior citizen,” and “successful aging” have been increasingly used in news stories and have angered the growing community.
