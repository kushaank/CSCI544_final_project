That’s about to change.

Last week, Baidu announced that it is hiring Andrew Ng , a renowned Stanford computer-science professor who also has led artificial intelligence projects at Google and has cofounded Coursera, the online-education company. Ng will take charge of a five-year, $300 million research initiative for Baidu, spanning both China and Silicon Valley. Ng will be based in Sunnyvale, Calif., where Baidu has big plans to build up its own brain trust.

- Born in the United Kingdom, with experience living in Hong Kong and Singapore, Ng is eager to build bridges between researchers in China and the U.S. He notes that Baidu’s Silicon Valley research team will be augmented by some of his own prior research colleagues, including Adam Coates, who has been a post-doc researcher in Ng’s Stanford lab.
