
Proposed new Environmental Protection Agency air-quality standards will require refiners such as San Antonio-based Valero Energy Corp. and Tesoro Corp. to take the pricey step of installing new monitoring equipment at all of their plants, the industryâ€™s primary trade association says.

While environmental groups have praised the agencyâ€™s proposed rules, saying they will cut health risks for those living near the nationâ€™s 150 refineries, the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers argues the new rules will saddle refiners with major costs without adequate proof of a public health benefit.

While AFPM has not completed a financial analysis, its estimates the cost to U.S. refineries will be "significantly higher" than EPAâ€™s estimate of $240 million, says Rebecca Adler , a spokeswoman for the association.

The EPA last week released its 870-page proposal as part of a consent decree that resolved a lawsuit filed by environmental groups on behalf of people living near refineries in Texas, Louisiana and California. The new standards, if adopted, would be the first alteration to refinersâ€™ emission rules in almost two decades.
