
White House press secretary Jay Carney received a stiff rebuke at Monday’s press briefing after trying to spin the resignation of Dr. Robert Petzel, Veterans Affairs undersecretary for health, as proof of the administration’s accountability for the escalating scandal over veterans’ waiting lists.

The spat began when ABC’s Jonathan Karl began questioning Carney about VA Secretary Eric Shinseki.

“If this mess regarding wait times isn’t cleaned up soon, are General Shinseki’s days numbered as VA secretary?” Karl asked Carney.

Karl forcefully rebutted Carney’s point, waving a press release from the VA.

Things got more uncomfortable for Carney when MSNBC’s Chuck Todd followed up on Karl’s questioning.
