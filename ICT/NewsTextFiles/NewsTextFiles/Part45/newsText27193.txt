
Erie's gross domestic product is growing but its workforce is shrinking, according to a new report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.

Barb Chaffee, chief executive of the Erie Regional Chamber and Growth Partnership, said one of the most interesting parts of the report is a breakdown on employment growth by sector, which showed manufacturing jobs stayed stable even with cuts at GE Transportation.

"There are definitely mixed signals, but I think there are some good signs in there," Chaffee said. "We would still like to see more growing in manufacturing and construction."

The number of jobs declined in most of Erie's major industries, including construction, government, education and health services, information, and business services.

Even expanding industries, like hospitality and finance, grew more slowly than what was seen statewide and national.

- Erie's unemployment rate as of February was 6.4 percent, 0.3 percentage points lower than the national average, and well below the 8.1 percent seen in early 2013. But the Cleveland Fed attributes much of the decline to a downward trend in the number of people looking to enter the labor force.

- Erie's GDP grew about 5 percent from 2010 to 2012, compared with 1.7 percent statewide and 1.3 percent nationally. The local GDP is still 1.6 percent below what was seen in 2007.

- Home prices jumped 5.7 percent nationally from early 2013 to March 2014, but rose just 1 percent in Erie over that same period. The good news is Erie's homes are worth about 5 percent more than they were just before the recession.

- Credit card delinquencies in Erie and nationally have steadily dropped since their peak in 2007, with Erie's delinquencies well below the national average and about on par with what is seen across Pennsylvania.
