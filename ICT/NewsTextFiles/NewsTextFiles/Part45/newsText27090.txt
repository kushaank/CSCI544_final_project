Arkansas voters will head to the polls Tuesday for a primary election that will be the first big test for the state's voter identification law.

Early voters have already had their say.

"We have 18,000 more registered voters than we did in 2010, but we're having less voter turnout," Benton County Clerk Tena O'Brien said.

The law went into effect Jan. 1 and requires voters to show a valid  state or federal id that proves citizenship before casting a ballot.

O'Brien said she hopes the lower turnout has little to do with the new law.

You've always had to provide some kind of identification. I think most people wouldn't mind proving that is who voted a ballot."

Last week, the state Supreme Court ruled against a lower court that tried to strike down the voter ID law.

Supporters say it prevents illegal voting, but opponents say it's unnecessary and discouraging.
