
Paras Arora, owner of Live Oak Wine & Spirits, has added U-Haul truck rentals to its offerings.

Few things taste better than a cold beer after the sweaty job of unpacking furniture from a move.

Or so reasons Paras Arora , whose Live Oak Wine & Spirits recently added U-Haul moving equipment and supplies to its offerings. The four-month-old liquor store, located at 12107 Toepperwein Road, signed an agreement to stock the rental giantâ€™s trucks, trailers and other gear.

Arora looked into other ventures to supplement Live Oakâ€™s revenues â€” among them, luxury car rentals. But he elected to go the slightly-less-glamorous U-Haul route because the company charges no franchise fee and provides around-the-clock support to its dealers.

He expects truck rentals to make up about a third of his business this year.

U-Haul officials wouldnâ€™t say how many other liquor stores rent U-Haul equipment, but added that the companyâ€™s 1,500 dealer affiliates represent a wide range of businesses. Those entities help fill in the gaps between U-Haulâ€™s larger, company-owned stores.

The idea of pairing booze and box trucks wasnâ€™t that big a leap, Arora says. Several friends in Florida rented U-Haul gear at their convenience stores.

And U-Haul never raised any issues about Live Oakâ€™s other line of business.
