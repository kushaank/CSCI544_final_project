
â€œI couldn't teach a lie,â€� he says.

So, the Tuscon, Ariz., resident sold all his belongings and joined a 3,000-mile march from Los Angeles to Washington, DC, to implore lawmakers to address the human causes of climate change.

About 40 participants in the Great March for Climate Action left Santa Fe this morning, heading for Taos after a May 17 rally and â€œstay dayâ€� at the CCAâ€™s Sustainable Sundays Film Festival.

With a cry of â€œSol, not coal,â€� the marchers ask for businesses and individuals to make power with renewable energy instead of fossil fuel.They hope their voices (and the people they mobilize while walking across the country) could sway corporations to take responsibility for the health of the environment and the people in it.

The marchers also call for society to depart from â€œsenseless consumerism,â€� in the words of Jorgenson, and reconnect with nature and their communities.

Each marcher has his or her personal way of activism.

Debaura James, the only long-term marcher from New Mexico, draws from her experience founding a Silver City charter school centered around sustainability to present at schools along the route.

Sean Glenn, of Connecticut, chose not to speak for the entire eight-month journey. She wanted to â€œstand for the unheard victimsâ€� of climate change, without â€œscreaming across the country,â€� she writes in a text.

For Steve Martin, â€œitâ€™s just in the footsteps.â€� A self-labeled â€œspiritual walkerâ€� who walked the 550-mile Camino de Santiago in Europe last year, he see walking as a form of healing and progress, important, especially to him.

He carries a blue stone in a pouch of his orange traffic vest, gifted to him by a Navajo in Phoenix, Ariz. The man told Martin he had put a blessing on it and when Martin faced weak moments, he was to hold the stone close. If he failed, he was to bury the stone in the ground. If he succeeded, he was to return, and the man would finish his blessing.

For now, Martinâ€™s convictions are strong.
