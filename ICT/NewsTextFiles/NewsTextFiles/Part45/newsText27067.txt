
The interim city manager in Mount Clemens today warned of a pending financial emergency in the county seat if additional revenue is not soon secured as the city continues to spend more money than it brings in.

Interim City Manager Robert Bruner said if a charter amendment on the August 5 ballot that would allow Mount Clemens to raise its maximum millage rate fails, he will request the Michigan Department of Treasury to conduct a preliminary review to determine the existence of a financial emergency.

That would be the first step in declaring bankruptcy or having Governor Rick Snyder appoint an emergency financial manager to oversee the city�s finances.

�Mount Clemens was one of the first communities to begin declining and has fared worst than most, losing nearly 28 percent of its tax base,� Bruner said in a news release.

The Mount Clemens City Commission tonight is expected to vote on the 2014-2015 fiscal year budget of $9.6 million, which is $1.1 million more in expenses than revenue.

The commission would take money out of the $3.5 million cash reserve fund to balance the budget, which would leave only $1.7 million in the fund balance in 2015.

According to the manager�s office, Mount Clemens� largest revenue sources decreased dramatically during the Great Recession. Property taxes fell by more than 30 percent since 2008 while State Revenue Sharing funds plunged by more than 50 percent.

Commissioners have cut expenses by one third or $4.3 million in recent years but the cuts were not sufficient to balance the budget.

City officials say Mount Clemens can�t continue to pay for unfunded liabilities such as retiree health care costs and still provide essential services with existing revenues.

The proposed budget the commission will act on tonight does not contain any layoffs or reductions in services. Bruner said there is no point in preparing a list because if the millage plan fails, it will be time to initiate a state financial review.

Voters in August will be asked to approve a plan to raise the ad valorem property tax from 15 to 20 mills, which would bring in an extra $1.6 million in revenue.

But even if the measure is approved, Mount Clemens will still need to take money out of the fund balance again because the city cannot levy and collect the additional property tax money until July 1, 2015.

Bruner last week invited consultants from the Southeastern Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) for an operational review to determine if municipal operations are running as efficiently as possible.

Tonight�s commission meeting begins at 7 p.m. at City Hall, 1 Crocker Boulevard.
