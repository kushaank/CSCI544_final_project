
This is the letter Cameron Sharp wrote in his middle school class.

Gail Sharp of Andersonville was caught off guard when she got an envelope in the mail addressed to Cameron Sharp.

She said, "I could tell by the envelope that it was Cameron's handwriting."

Cameron is Gail Sharp's youngest son of two. The 17-year-old Anderson County High School senior died in January 2013 after the Norris Police Department said the car the teen was riding in hit a Ford F-250 truck at the interchange of Highway 61 and Highway 441.
