More than 1,500 people filled the Chapel at Crosspoint Saturday morning to pay their respects to Ben Sauer.

GETZVILLE, N.Y. - More than 1,500 people filled the Chapel at Crosspoint Saturday morning to pay their respects to Ben Sauer.

Thousands of people followed Ben's journey through his mother Mindy's blog, " Blue 4 Ben ."  Landmarks across Western New York were lit up in blue - the color Mindy chose for Ben so people could tell him and his twin brother, Jack, apart.  On Twitter and Facebook people shared photos of them wearing blue in support of the little boy.

"This young man only lived for five years, but his impact in four or five months may be as great or greater than any of us will experience in a lifetime," said Pastor Jerry Gillis.

More than 5,000 people watched Saturday's service online, and others gathered at Eastern Hills Wesleyan Church to watch funeral which was broadcast there.

Dan Albrect, Ben's uncle, delivered a eulogy written by Ben's grandfather.

"Ben was a little boy with a large capacity for kindness and compassion.  He was a born teacher, gentle, patient, and full of joy," said Albrect.

"Ben was the goofy one.  He loved being silly.  He loved to see you laugh.  Ben was the first one to grab his sister's hand or take action to keep Jack from harm."

A photo slideshow played on two large screens.  A video tribute from Ben's twin brother, Jack, was also played during the service.
