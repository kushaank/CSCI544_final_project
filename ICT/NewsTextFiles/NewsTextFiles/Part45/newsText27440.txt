BAYONNE, N.J. (AP) - Three shipping cranes designed to load and unload the worldâ€™s largest container ships have arrived at the Port Newark Container Terminal in New Jersey.

The cranes, which cost $40 million, were delivered Sunday aboard a ship that carried them from China.

The cranes are part of an effort to expand the terminal on Newark Bay to make room for ships that are capable of carrying 7,000 shipping containers.

The cranes will stand 561-feet tall and will have the capacity to unload 22 rows of containers instead of the current 18.
