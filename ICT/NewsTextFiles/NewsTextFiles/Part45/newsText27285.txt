
Vaiko may get RS ticket outside T.N.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), seeking to reach out to more allies from ‘important States’ where the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) did not fare well in the Lok Sabha polls, is toying with the idea of offering MDMK general secretary Vaiko a Rajya Sabha berth. The MDMK leader met Prime Minister-designate Narendra Modi and BJP chief Rajnath Singh in New Delhi on Monday.

DMDK founder Vijayakant, his wife Premalatha, and Pattali Makkal Katchi MP Anbumani Ramadoss are also camping in Delhi to take part in the NDA meeting on Tuesday. The central leadership of the BJP wants to have leaders “outside” the party from all “important States” to lend their voice in Parliament in support of the new government.

“Vaiko is one of those we are looking at. We were sure that he would win his seat. But since he has lost, we are looking at other options to see if we could get him here [Delhi],” a senior BJP leader told The Hindu on condition of anonymity.

If such a proposal is made, Mr. Vaiko should be elected to the Rajya Sabha from outside Tamil Nadu as the BJP and its allies do not have the numbers to do so in the State. At the moment, there is no idea of offering Mr. Vaiko a ministerial berth.

Mr. Vaiko said there was no discussion on the Rajya Sabha seat during his meeting Mr. Modi and Rajnath Singh.
