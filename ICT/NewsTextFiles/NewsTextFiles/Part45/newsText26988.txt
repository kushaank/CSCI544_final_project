Let me be the first to say that the elements are there: her political positioning, her talents and personality. The desires of the electorate and the manifest needs of this country. First the political positioning. Hillary is a notch and a half, I'd say, to the right of President Obama on foreign policy. I consider that the sweet spot.

A little tough, a little more for American involvement than Obama, but not too much. Not over there with the Republicans and their neocon allies who want us at constant war with whoever happens to be thumbing their nose at us. Second, there are her talents: hard work, experience, a willingness to work with Republicans. Indeed, a real feel for the political world and how it works. If she weren't a candidate I'm sure a lot of Republicans would be saying this. It's an established fact that people who work with her like her. She is, to paraphrase an old adversary, more than likable enough. Third, the American people have had it up to here with the national politics that argues incessantly and gets nothing done. This damn gridlock. They want a president who can crack through the ice of do-nothing government. Someone who can bring down the walls that divide the two parties which discourage them from working together for the country.

Look at the list of potential presidents in both parties and tell me someone else besides Hillary Clinton who has the track record she does to carry on in this front. Fourth, for this country to compete with China and the rest of the world in this looming century, we need to find a leader who will inspire trust, trust to rebuild America. Trust with the money to do it. Trust to rebuild our immigration policy. Trust to bring harmony and hope at home and true enforcement at the border. That too requires trust.
