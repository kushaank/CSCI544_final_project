Former Sen. Bob Kerrey on Monday called on President Obama to fire Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki , adding his voice to the growing chorus of lawmakers and veterans groups demanding the former Army chief of staff lose his job over the scandalous mismanagement of VA hospitals.

He suggested that Mr. Obama name a returning veteran from the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan as the new VA secretary.

“I understand the importance of that medical system. I think Shinseki has lost the confidence both of the people who work there and the Congress,” Mr. Kerrey said.

Several lawmakers and veterans groups, including the the American Legion, also have called for the ouster of Mr. Shinseki .

Mr. Shinseki faced hostile questioning on Capitol Hill last week about secret waiting lists allegedly used at some VA hospitals to conceal extended delays in treatment. The delays and waiting lists have been blamed for 40 deaths at a VA hospital on Phoenix, CNN reported.

The White House has continued to support Mr. Shinseki .
