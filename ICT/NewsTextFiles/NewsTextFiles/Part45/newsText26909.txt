SANDSTONE TWP., MI – A 17-year-old went to Allegiance Health early Saturday, May 17, after he said he accidentally shot himself while cleaning his gun at a home on W. Michigan Avenue.

He went to the hospital with an injury to the abdomen, Michigan State Police Sgt. David Stamler said.

Police were called to the residence just after midnight to investigate a self-inflicted or accidental shooting, Stamler said.

Stamler said the teen was expected to be all right.

He was reported to be drinking before the shooting.

The sergeant did not have a lot of details about what occurred. All the information is "very preliminary," he said Monday.

State police are continuing their inquiry.
