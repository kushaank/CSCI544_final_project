
HURON — Maj. Gen. Tim Reisch, adjutant general of South Dakota, will deliver the address at Huron’s Memorial Day program on May 26.

It will also be the Veterans Memorial Day Enhancement Dedication ceremony at the memorial at Third Street and Wisconsin Avenue Southwest.

The program will begin at 10 a.m.

Other guest speakers for the dedication will be Col. Ralph Borkowski, retired; Lt. Col. Deborah A. Gilbertson, retired; Michael J. Fitzmaurice, Medal of Honor recipient; Rep. Dick Werner, R-Huron; and Dave Wright, of the Leadership Huron Class of 2012-2013.

Special music will be provided by the 147th Army Band.

The enhanced memorial has the names of 826 Beadle County veterans on the wall.

In the last year, the site was improved so that it stands out more as a veterans memorial with the addition of military statues, more lighting, the memorial wall, marble tablets, flags and a Medal of Honor statue.

The project was made possible through the contributions and support of present and deceased veterans with Beadle County ties and their families.
