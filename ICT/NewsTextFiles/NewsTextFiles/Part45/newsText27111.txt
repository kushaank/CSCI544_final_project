
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- When people head to the polls Tuesday to vote in the Arkansas primary, they’ll find the majority of contested races on the Republican side of things.  The GOP has races with multiple candidates at the national, state and local level.

Historically, it's been the democrats who've seen more robust primaries, but 2014 could  be a sign of further political change for Arkansas.

The candidates agree about cutting taxes.

"It was a mistake in the very beginning, all the way through. I have never changed my position on it," Coleman said during a debate.

"I see it as a test it might work -- the big question is whether it's affordable over the long term," Hutchinson countered.

On the Democratic side, former congressman Mike Ross is expected to defeat primary opponent Dr. Lynette Bryant .

"They're sending out email blasts like we have great candidates but they do not put my name on it," Bryant said.

Of  the state’s four federal congressional districts, two districts feature  contested Republican races.  In District 2, which covers Little Rock  and Central Arkansas, businessman French Hill , State Representative Ann Clemmer and consultant Colonel Conrad Reynolds are looking to make the November ballot. In District 4, which covers  Hot Springs and most of the state’s western half, businessman Tommy Moll faces off against State Representative Bruce Westerman .

It’s  expected more people will vote in the Republican primary than the  Democratic primary for the first time in recent memory.  The Secretary  of State’s office has predicted 20 percent voter turnout.
