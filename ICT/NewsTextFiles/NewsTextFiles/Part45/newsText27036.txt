
Georgia Senate candidate Michelle Nunn is refusing to say whether she would have voted for President Barack Obama's signature health care law in a race that could help determine congressional control.

In a recent NBC News interview, Nunn said, "it's impossible to look back retrospectively and say, 'What would you have done if you were there?'"

Nunn has been critical of some aspects of the law, and praised other elements. She said "Obamacare" should not be repealed. A recent poll found most Georgians think the law needs major changes or should be repealed.

Republicans must gain six seats to win the majority and have tried to make the midterm elections a referendum on "Obamacare."

Nunn is poised to capture the Democratic nomination for the open seat on Tuesday.
