
Kentuckians have come out in droves, over four hundred-thirteen thousand of them have filled out forms on the state run website, fifty percent of whom are under thirty five. Governor Beshear says his state run internet marketplace worked while Washington struggled with its system.

Some people in Kentucky are glad the system seems to be working. Glenna Crockett works with senior citizens at the Rowan County Senior Center in Morehead Kentucky. She lost her health coverage and turned to the state system as her only lifeline.

Crockett says she is better off now than she was with her previous plan.

However, not everyone is jumping for joy over what Governor Beshear did; Doctor Anthony Weaver teaches medicine at the University of Kentucky and hosts a radio talk show about health.

Weaver’s big worry is how to pay for it. Washington’s offer to fully cover Medicaid comes with a time limit. After three years, the federal money will be reduced, but the cost of healthcare won’t be. Weaver says Kentucky is going to have to pay the difference.

Weaver admits though, the average Kentuckian is probably better off with the flawed system than the alternative, which is none at all.

Another bone of contention is how Beshear did it. Kentucky’s governor didn’t ask the state legislature. He just signed an executive order and it was done. Despite the political end-around, Beshear is getting support from his own party; that includes Democratic state senator Walter Blevins.

Blevins says even if the Republicans manage to do away with or change the law, the plan would still have done some good.

This is where Kentucky’s political landscape is unusual. Their congressional delegation leans Republican and the state government is mostly Democratic.  Governor Beshear says doesn’t matter when it comes to healthcare.
