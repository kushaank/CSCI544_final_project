
A North Florida woman pleaded guilty to sending hoax anthrax letters to U.S. senators Marco Rubio and Bill Nelson, the U.S. Attorney's Office reported Monday.

Prosecutors say Kathryn Cohen Allen, 47, of Jasper mailed threatening letters that contained a white powder to Rubio and Nelson's respective offices in June 2011.

Laboratory tests eventually determined the powder was not hazardous.

The U.S. Attorney's Office said Allen was implicated in the case when her handwriting matched that in the letters.

Allen admitted she mailed the letters in an attempt to frame her neighbor, whom she thought was having an interracial relationship, prosecutors said.

She faces up to 10 years in federal prison and a $500,000 fine. Allen's sentencing hearing has not been scheduled.
