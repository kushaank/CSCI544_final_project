
Mac, a 20-year-0ld male chimpanzee, lived at the Houston Zoo for the past four years.

A male chimpanzee at the Houston Zoo was euthanized Monday, nearly a week after he was sedated for medical exams but failed to recover, zoo officials said.Mac, who was 20, was one of five chimps who were undergoing routine medical check-ups on May 13, officials said.

He had brain damage caused by oxygen deprivation. He was euthanized  after veterinarians and zoo staff decided that his condition was not going to improve.

Houston Zoo director Rick Barongi said Mac was one of 10 chimps who were donated to the zoo in 2010.

"We've never had a chimp pass away here on site according to my knowledge," Barongi said. "It's quite a loss to the zoo family."

The zoo is awaiting a pathology report to determine the cause of death.

When Mac first came to the zoo, he wasn't the alpha male, Barongi said, but he brought stability to the chimps there.

"The keepers have lost a member of their family, it's as simple as that," Barongi said. Grief counselors will be on site to talk to zoo staff if needed.
