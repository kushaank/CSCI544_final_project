
This year marks the 25th anniversary of the opening of the first Purple Cow restaurant, in Little Rock, and April 2 marked the opening of the fourth Purple Cow, at The Village at Hendrix in Conway.

The 4,100-SF restaurant occupies the first floor of the 30,000-SF $7.5 million Market Square South building, completed about a month ago, at The Village. The building also houses the Conway office of Delta Trust & Bank and Conway Management Inc., a hotel management group.

Tappan’s original partner in Purple Cow was Todd Gold, who’s now dean of Pulaski Technical College’s Culinary Arts & Hospitality Management Institute. Gold eventually left the Purple Cow operation, and Tappan now operates the four stores with Ken Vaughn as an equity partner. Vaughn serves as COO while Tappan is CEO.

When he first bought the Purple Cow, Tappan said, he and Gold targeted Conway for expansion but things just didn’t work out. So in 2010 they added a Hot Springs location to the two in Little Rock.

But then last summer, Hendrix College, Delta Trust CEO French Hill and Tappan joined to develop the Market Square South building at The Village at Hendrix, a so-called New Urbanist neighborhood adjacent to the Hendrix campus. The building’s second and third floors house Hendrix students.

The ownership of the building is shared between Hendrix, which owns the upper two floors, and the investor group, which owns the ground floor that houses commercial space.

Jason Schultz is the general manager of the Conway Purple Cow, which currently employs about 90. The four locations together employ about 200.

Polk Stanley Wilcox Architects of Little Rock designed Market Square, and Nabholz Construction Services of Conway was the project’s contractor.
