"The housing needs assessment will identify Pascagoula's strengths and opportunities on housing," Community and Economic Development Director Jen Dearman said.  "We hope to use this information to guide us in our decision-making about what we currently have as well as future developments."

The goal of the assessment is to assure that housing needs are identified and enable the development of programs that encourage economic development, raise property values, improve housing conditions and neighborhoods, increase new construction and rehabilitation, and attract young professionals, families and recent retirees.

The city is looking to identify and quantify its current and prospective housing needs, identify opportunities and constraints to housing development, identify locations for potential activity and propose reasonable solutions to help meet the housing needs of the city's residents.
