
Over 1,200 people have cast ballots for the primary as of Monday morning.

ARKADELPHIA, Ark.

County Clerk Rhonda Cole said Monday morning that 1,234 Clark County voters have cast a ballot in the primary election.

That figure surpasses the 805 early votes cast in the 2012 primary by 429 votes, Cole said.

Of the 805 early votes cast, 86 percent have voted Democrat and 13 percent have voted Republican; the remainder voted only in the non-partisan election.

Early voting, which can be done in Cole’s second-floor office of the Clark County Courthouse, wraps up Monday at 5 p.m.

Polls open Tuesday at 7:30 a.m. and close at 7:30 p.m.

Cole reminded voters to go to their polling site rather than the courthouse to cast a vote on Tuesday. Questions regarding polling locations can be directed to Cole’s office by calling (870) 246-4491.
