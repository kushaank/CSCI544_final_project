CARSON CITY, Nev. - Severe drought has led to the lifting of catch limits for fishermen at two northern Nevada reservoirs, state wildlife officials say.

Fishing limits are no longer in place at Wild Horse and Willow Creek reservoirs, said Chris Healy, public information officer for the state Department of Wildlife. Water levels are so low that it's likely that many fish will die off this summer, he said.

"There's a good chance we'll lose the fisheries, or most of the fisheries, in both those bodies of water," Healy said. "And so, in order to make sure that we give the sportsmen a chance to utilize the fishery, we're going to ask them to go out and catch as many fish as possible and remove them from the fishery."

Healy said the reservoirs, which trap rainwater and snowmelt from the mountains, are only at about 25 percent of capacity. By comparison, they've been at least two-thirds full during the past couple of years at this time. Many Nevada farmers downstream from the reservoirs also are dependent on the water to irrigate their crops.

The fish stock in these reservoirs is mostly trout and crappie. If it's lost, Healy said, the state will have to restock if and when water volume returns to a healthy level. The state grows its own trout but buys other fish species from commercial vendors, Healy said, adding that restocking the fisheries is likely to be pricey because demand will be high when the drought ends.

"Probably pay a little premium to purchase those fish," he said. "With a great demand for those fish, it may take longer to get hold of them."

Healy estimated that up to 25,000 trout are in Wild Horse Reservoir at any one time.
