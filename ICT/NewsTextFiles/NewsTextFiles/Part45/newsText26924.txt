
The elephant was spotted in the ocean in Pinellas County.

Beach-goers in Pinellas County, Fla., were surprised to see an elephant cooling down in the ocean over the weekend and a video of the animal standing in the surf has been making waves.

The elephant was apparently at North Redington Beach as part of a birthday party for a 60-year-old woman.

She had received permission in February to have the partying pachyderm attend the event, Bay News 9 reported .

"We could not believe our eyes," witness Todd Unbehagen told HLN TV . "There was a professional elephant trainer there and a couple police officers for the event.  It looked like somebody was having a party (private) at the beach house, and the elephant was giving rides as well to the guests."
