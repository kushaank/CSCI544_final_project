
COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — A ballot effort in Ohio to require billions of dollars in state investment in alternative energy has hit a snag after supporters revised the proposal.

Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine rejected the petition Monday for the Ohio Clean Energy Initiative, saying the proposed constitutional amendment didn't meet a signature requirement.  DeWine said the submission contained less than the 1,000 valid signatures that were needed.

The amendment calls for $1.3 billion in annual investments over a decade in infrastructure, research and development related to solar, wind and other energy sources.

The attorney general and state Ballot Board previously cleared a similar proposal last year. Though an attorney for its supporters said they revised the timing of the issuance of bonds under the amendment and had to refile their petition.
