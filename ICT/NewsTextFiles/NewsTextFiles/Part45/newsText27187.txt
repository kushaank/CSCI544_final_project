
RALEIGH, N.C. - Three North Carolina agencies are joining together in a campaign to keep people safe this summer.

The Highway Patrol, the Wildlife Resources Commission and the Alcohol Law Enforcement Division are announcing an effort on Monday that will focus on roadways and the water. The event is being held at the Upper Barton Creek boat access on Falls Lake in north Raleigh.

Law enforcement officers will be watching for impaired drivers by conducting checkpoints near recreational boating areas as well as making public service announcements that educate motorists on the dangers of driving while impaired.

Patrol Commander Col. Bill Grey says May is one of the busiest travel periods of the year, so motorists are being asked to buckle up, drive carefully and remain vigilant while traveling.
