
BIG SPRING- Most people describe Moss Creek Lake in Big Spring as peaceful, but on Sunday evening it was anything but that after a deadly shooting took place. We're told a gunman drove by a pavilion just before 9 p.m. and shot two men, killing 17-year-old Dylan Headrick and injuring another man.

"I just can't believe he's gone. He had so much to live for," Dolly Woodard, Headrick's grandma, said.

Woodard said Dylan was a good man and a father of a one year old girl.

"He loved life that's all it is. He loved to be around people," Woodard said.

Nicholas Hernandez is allegedly the gunman who pulled the trigger and now he's wanted for murder. Dylan's family said Hernandez was no stranger.

"I just know that he was shot four times by some guy that he already knew. He knew the guy, they were suppose to be friends," Shereda Wherry, Headrick's cousin, said.

Friends and family of Dylan are mourning the tragic loss. They're wondering why something like this would happen to a man they said had no enemies.

"It's not something I ever imagined having to go through. I hear about it on the news all the time but I never thought it would happen to us," Wherry said.

One thing is for sure, Dylan Headrick will definitely be missed.

"He was just fun to be around and he was always joking and making people laugh," Wherry said.

We're told the alleged shooter, Nicholas Hernandez, is armed and should be considered dangerous. If you have any information about Hernandez or the shooting you're asked to call Big Spring Police or Crime Stoppers.
