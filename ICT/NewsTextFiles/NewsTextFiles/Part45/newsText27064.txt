WICHITA, Kansas – The Kansas Highway Patrol is stepping up enforcement in time for Memorial Day.

Today, the patrol begins their STEP (Special Traffic Enforcement Program) campaign focusing on all types of driver safety.

“The number of crashes that we work related to impaired drivers, texting while driving, or speed related crashes, the number of injuries and fatalities are drastically reduced when people are utilizing their occupant restraints,” said Lt. Carl Mackey, Kansas Highway Patrol.

For Jenny Scheve, seat belt safety is especially important.

“The most important safety device in a car is still your seat belt. It takes three seconds to put it on, and it can absolutely save your life,” said Jenny Scheve, Think First.

In August of 2012, Feugate was involved in a serious accident.

She is now paralyzed from the waist down.

She travels with Think First trying to spread the message of awareness hoping that her story can prevent another crash from happening.

“I was one of those kids who I sat through the assemblies and I thought this is really sad, but it’s not gonna happen to me. I don’t have to worry about this,” said Feugate.

The enforcement campaign runs from Monday, May 19, through Sunday, June 1.

Last year, over the Memorial Day holiday, troopers worked three fatal crashes on Kansas highways.

Three people were killed.
