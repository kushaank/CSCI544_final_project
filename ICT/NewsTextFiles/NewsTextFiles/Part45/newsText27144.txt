
KNOX COUNTY, Ky. (WKYT) - BARBOURVILLE, Ky. (WKYT) - Melinda Smith isn’t holding much back in what she thinks will be justice for what happened to her 29-year-old brother,  Donald.

“I wanted to torment them like they did my brother. That’s the only thing you can say about it right now,” Smith said after watching the four people accused in her brother’s death answer to the charges in Knox District Court.

The three men and one woman are all charged with the murder of one man.

Bradley Christopher Wagner, Patrick Baker, and Angela Mill’s attorneys also asked for the half million dollar bonds to be lowered and Baker’s attorney asked for home incarceration, but the judge denied it. Elijah Messer was also arraigned but the judge denied his request for a public defender.

Police first arrested Baker and Wagner, and the two others over the weekend.

“They had their joy ride for a week, Patrick Baker did. It is sad,  this Elijah Messer, I went to school with him, graduated together,” Smith said.

Relatives say they are still trying to put all of his together, how it happened; what the relationship was between the four and Mills.

Police say Mills was shot after several broke in to his home pretending to cops. The family was held hostage including Mills 11and 7-year-old sons who witnessed the violence.

“Justice will be for them to take them to the courthouse and hang them by neck, let Connor and Cameron pull the rope and let them do it,” said Smith.

Police haven’t said much about the motive and court records only say that all four were served arrest warrants on murder. Still a lot of questions but Smith promises she’ll follow the case closely.

“The way I am going to get through this? They got them put in jail. I will make sure he gets justice. He’s not here but I will stand up for him,” said Smith.
