
PHOENIX, May 19, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Memorial Day is a holiday that many of us take for granted. It is easy to lose track of the significance of the holiday because we are so wrapped up in our own lives. Take time out this weekend to reflect on the brave men and women who gave their lives for this country we all love so deeply, because that is what this day is all about. Here at U-Haul , we value that sacrifice and understand that freedom is not free.

Spending time outdoors during that weekend will be about enjoying the beautiful weather and grilling a meal for loved ones.  Buying U-Haul propane in advance of your trip can help you save time and money by avoiding the hassle of having to buy propane at the last minute. Whether you plan to enjoy recreational traveling in your RV, or if you're staying in town to host a backyard barbecue, take advantage of U-Haul Company's propane refills .  Our propane refills can save you money and time – both of which you will need to relax during your vacation.   If you don't have a grill to use this Memorial Day weekend, buy this three-in-one outdoor cooker from U-Haul. Whatever your plans are, U-Haul will be there to make sure you have what you need to celebrate.
