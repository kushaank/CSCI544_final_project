A 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, killed four Americans. A Libyan man walks in the rubble of the damaged  U.S. facility in Benghazi, Libya, after an attack that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens on the night of Tuesday, Sept. 11, 2012.

Fact: There were 13 "Benghazis" of American embassies and consulates during the Bush years but not a peep from Republicans and far more attacks and deaths in the last 40 years under Republican presidents then Democratic presidents.

Total number of deaths during the Bush years alone: 60.

Benghazi: Four.
