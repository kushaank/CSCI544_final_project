
Dogs are already well-known for their keen sense of smell, but soon they could be using that talent to save lives — by detecting prostate cancer.

The two dogs participating in the study were trained to sniff out samples containing chemicals produced by prostate cancer, then lie down beside them.

Michigan urologist Brian Stork told  NBC  the use of the dogs to detect the cancer is groundbreaking.

"The possibility of using dogs [to identify] cancer is something most would never have considered possible a decade or two ago. It's an interesting concept that 'man's best friend' could help save your life."

But some are considering the new technique just that, though: a concept. As  The  Inquisitr  writes"Patients should not rely on their pets to diagnose or rule out any illness. The studies were performed in a controlled environment with volunteers who were already diagnosed by a medical doctor."

Still, dogs have shown success smelling out cancer in other studies before.

According to the  American Cancer Society , prostate cancer kills some 29,000 men each year.

The findings were reported at an annual meeting of the American Urological Association Sunday.
