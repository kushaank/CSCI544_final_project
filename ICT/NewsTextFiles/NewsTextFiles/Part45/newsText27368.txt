Vanguard University officials recently announced the hiring of a new provost and vice president for academic affairs.

Effective in July, Doretha O'Quinn will take over the position at the private Costa Mesa campus. The award-winning educator, author and speaker replaces Mike Wilson, who has had the position since August.

O'Quinn comes to Vanguard from Biola University in La Mirada, where she served as vice provost of multiethnic and cross-cultural engagement. She also was an associate dean at Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego.

"Vanguard University has an established commitment to equipping students for a spirit-empowered life of Christ-centered leadership and service," Wilson said in a news release. "Dr. O'Quinn joins a strong academic faculty where her leadership will further this mission and undoubtedly serve the institution well."

President Michael J. Beals added in the release that O'Quinn "carries esteemed credentials in higher education, a strong academic commitment to diversity and intellectual passions, which make her a great cultural fit for Vanguard University. Dr. O'Quinn's engaging personal style and demonstration of mentor relationships will make a transforming impact on our students, our faculty and the mission of Vanguard."

O'Quinn holds a bachelor's degree from Life Pacific College, and a master's and doctorate from Biola. She has 34 years of experience in public and private schools as a teacher, administrator and principal.
