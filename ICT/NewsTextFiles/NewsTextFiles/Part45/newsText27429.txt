Wisconsin has a new most popular boys name, while a longstanding favorite maintained the top spot on the girls side.

Liam was the name given to more Wisconsin-born boys than any other in 2013, knocking Mason out of the No. 1 spot it had held for three straight years.

Emma, meanwhile, made it back-to-back years as the favorite for Wisconsin girls. It has been in the top 10 for 15 straight years.

The figures are compiled annually by the Social Security Administration based on applications for Social Security cards. There are some catches (similar-sounding names with different spellings are not combined, names have to be at least two letters long) but it's generally considered to be an accurate presentation of how parents are naming their children.

For states, only the top 100 names for each gender are listed each year.

We've put together an interactive database of Wisconsin's most popular baby names for the last 20 years. Give it a spin — click on a name to see how it has trended — then continue below for some more information.

• Wisconsin differed from the national No. 1s in 2013, Noah and Sophia. Noah was seventh in Wisconsin after being as high as No. 3 in 2009. Sophia was No. 1 for Wisconsin girls in 2010 and 2011 but lost the top spot to Emma in 2012.

• The names from the 2013 Wisconsin lists that made their first appearance in the top 100 over the past 20 years: Penelope (54th), Ivy (75th), Mila (76th), Willow (80th), Sadie (84th), Alice (95th) and Rylee (95th) for girls; Jase (45th), Camden (60th), Silas (70th), Leo (85th), Declan (89th), Weston (89th) and Kayden (95th) for boys.

• The top names in Wisconsin from 1994 have fallen off today. Jacob was 14th in 2013, while Samantha fell all the way to 54th.

• Logan has been in the boys' top 10 for 11 straight years, more than any other currently in that range.

If you'd like to see this sort of info displayed in a really cool interactive graph starting in 1880, google "Name Voyager". It uses blue for boys' names and pink for girls' names, so you can see, for example, that Lynn was almost exclusively a boy's name until 1920, when all of a sudden it began to be applied to girls. The profile of my own name, Richard, looks like Mont Blanc, peaking in 1944, the year I was born, and falling off like the twerking fad immediately thereafter.
