
HOUSTON (FOX 26) - While melanoma may be the least common form of skin cancer overall, the American Academy of Dermatology has determined that it is the most common type of skin cancer for young adults between the ages 25 and 29, as well as the second most common type of cancer for people between the ages of 15 and 29.

One American dies from melanoma each hour with an estimated 9,700 melanoma-related deaths in the U.S. projected for 2014.

Melanoma may not develop in an existing mole and can affect people with few or no moles. Symptoms of melanoma include a change in the shape, size or color of a mole and an increased amount of moles brings a greater risk for melanoma.

What can appear to be a bruise that does not heal or a dark streak under a fingernail or toenail, can be melanoma. It can also appear in areas not exposed to the sun including underarms, butt and genitals.

Melanoma is also increasingly developing into a problem for the 'Baby Boomer' generation who did not benefit from modern sunscreen during childhood.

While basal and squamous cell carcinomas are more common than melanoma, people with the carcinomas have improved survival rates than melanoma patients.

Dr. Sherry Ingraham recommends that people conduct self skin checks and asserts that anyone with a family history of melanoma can be more prone to it than the rest of the population.
