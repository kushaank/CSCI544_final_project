
Expect a sunny start to the week with comfortable temperatures. The rest of the week should be nice as well.

South Florida's Monday forecast calls for mostly sunny skies with highs in the mid 80s and lows in the low 70s.

It also should be breezy, with gusts up to 23 mph. Because of winds, beware of rip currents at the beaches.

Tuesday's forecast is similar.

Central Florida's forecast: Sunny with highs in the upper 80s and lows in the upper 60s.

This is National Safe Boating week with the slogan "Just Wear It," referring to wearing a personal flotation device. There are a wide range of recreational watercraft in south Florida from "Go Fast" boats to kayaks, and all are impacted by our weather.

Naturally, if a hurricane threatens, it behooves everyone to have a plan. This can range from taking the boat out of the water to sheltering in place or moving to a hurricane "harbor." The most important factor during a hurricane is don't stay on the boat.

The main boating hazards at this time of year are thunderstorms with lightning strikes and occasional strong wind gusts.

As is common knowledge, Florida is the lightning capital of the United States, and although most of storms over southeast Florida occur over land and move further inland during the day, under certain conditions they can move offshore over Biscayne Bay, the Intracoastal Waterway and the Atlantic.

This presents a threat to boaters who have gone out before the storms form and then become trapped between the dock and the approaching storms.
