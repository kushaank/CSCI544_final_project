
ANCHORAGE, Alaska, May 19, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- The Alaska Railroad is introducing all-inclusive dining for its GoldStar service, to launch in summer of 2015, which will mark the 10th anniversary of the Railroad's GoldStar Service.

"This is another example of the Alaska Railroad's commitment to continuously improving its services," said Alaska Railroad Director of Guest Services and Passenger Marketing Bruce LaLonde. "All-inclusive dining for GoldStar passengers brings added value and adds to the convenience of the Alaska Railroad experience."

With the new all-inclusive package, GoldStar guests will be able to enjoy any of the first-class meals offered by the Alaska Railroad's onboard menu, featuring a selection of local cuisine from Alaska seafood to reindeer sausage.
