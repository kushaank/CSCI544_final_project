Half dome is a destination for many hikers. The cables opened Friday, May 16, 2014, a week earlier than previously scheduled due to the low snow pack. Hikers wishing to ascend the cables between May 16 and May 22 can apply online at: www.recreation.gov for a first-come, first-served, permit.

The regularly scheduled half dome season will commence Friday, May 23. Permits for the regular season were available through a lottery during the month of March. Approximately 50 permits per day will be available on a daily basis through a two day in advance lottery beginning Wednesday, May 21. Visitors wishing to obtain a permit can make reservations at www.recreation.gov or call 877-444-6777.

The trail to Half Dome from Yosemite Valley is an extremely strenuous hike covering over 17 miles. Hikers gain 4,800 feet of elevation along the trail that passes highlights such as Vernal Fall and Nevada Fall, before reaching the cables on half dome's steep granite shoulder. Metal cables and wooden planks are placed along the steep shoulder of the dome to assist hikers to the summit.
