
RALEIGH – North Carolina's unemployment rate continues to fall, according to data released on Friday. It’s down to 6.2 percent.

That's welcome news for the thousands of people who now have a job, but policy analyst Allan Freyer with the North Carolina Budget and Tax Center says based on recent jobs reports, not everyone is reaping the rewards.

"These reports make it clear that the state's economy is growing unevenly, across the state,” he said. “Some regions are doing a lot better than others."

A recent analysis by the Center showed that North Carolina's business incentive program disproportionately allocates incentive dollars to projects in the wealthiest 20 counties in the state. Freyer also points out that, although adding 71,000 jobs in the last year, it will be another year before the state catches up to where it was before the Great Recession, at the current job-growth rate.

"That basically means that the state is promising to create or retain two jobs in the 20 wealthiest counties in the state for every one job promised to the poorest counties in the state," he explains.

Freyer adds it is costing the state almost twice as much in incentive dollars for each job promised in the wealthiest counties, compared to counties in more economically distressed areas. According to the Center's analysis, the incentive money has been focused in the Asheville and greater Charlotte areas, the Research Triangle and the I-40 corridor in the Triad.
