
While it's been 10 years since Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriages, many same-sex couples are still fighting for equal rights.

It's a historic date in United States history, this weekend marks the 10th anniversary of Massachusetts legalizing same-sex marriage.

Couples lined up outside of courthouses on May 17, 2004, eager to finally make their love official.

"We've come a long way in 10 years, since that breakthrough win in Massachusetts and couples began marrying," said Evan Wolfson.

But despite increasing acceptance of same-sex relationships, couples across the country are still fighting for equal rights.

Utah placed a stay on same-sex parent adoptions Friday night, backed by conservative activists. Utah's law banning same-sex marriage has been declared unconstitutional, but that ruling is still facing appeals, meaning same-sex marriages in the state are on hold, for now.

Given that hold, the attorney general claims that decision needs to be resolved before ruling on adoption laws.

"No matter how hard they try, two men can't be a mother and two women can't be a father," said Gayle Ruzicka.

Advocacy groups have expressed their frustration with this decision.

"District judges ordered the state to grant these adoptions to gay couples that were already married so to take that away is very hurtful and frustrating for families," said Deann Armes.

Just this week, Idaho and Arkansas also placed stays on same-sex marriages, just days after courts ruled against the states' constitutional bans.

"I just pray the Supreme Court sees that, you know, we deserve equality, we deserve to be treated equally," said Hilda Jones.

Those decisions are currently awaiting appeals.
