CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) - West Virginiaâ€™s top transportation official says the state spent $13.5 million more than it expected to clear snowy, icy roads this winter.

But Transportation Secretary Paul Mattox says extra revenue from motorist taxes more than covered the pressing winter road needs.

Through April, state fuel and vehicle privilege taxes came in a combined $28.7 million higher than what the state projected. Registrations brought in an extra $2.6 million.

Mattox calls it a positive economic sign that people are out driving, buying gasoline and purchasing more cars.

Mattox said Monday that West Virginia spent $68.5 million total to remove snow and ice from roads this year. He says the spending helps control costs to fill potholes resulting from a particularly cold, snowy winter.
