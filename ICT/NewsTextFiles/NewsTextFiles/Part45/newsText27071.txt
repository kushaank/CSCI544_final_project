GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) â€” Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is in South Carolina to work for U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham's re-election.

Rice told more than 1,000 people Monday at a luncheon in Greenville that returning Graham to the Senate is vital to keeping the United States the standard for the rest of the free world.

She then answered questions from the crowd for 45 minutes, hitting on topics like the crisis in Ukraine and how to handle problems in the Middle East.

Rice was Secretary of State for nearly the entire second term of former President George W. Bush.

Graham is seeking a third term. He has six challengers in June's Republican primary. Graham will also face a Democratic and a Libertarian opponent in the fall.
