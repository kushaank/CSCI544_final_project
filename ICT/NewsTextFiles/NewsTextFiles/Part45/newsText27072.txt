
More than 100 people were running around the old Tennessee State Penitentiary on Saturday morning, but it was nothing to worry about.

There wasn't a prison break.

The state prison, which housed inmates until 1992, served as the site of the state Department of Corrections' first-ever 5K run/walk. All proceeds went to Big Brothers and Big Sisters of Middle Tennessee.
