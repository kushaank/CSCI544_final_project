
CLARKSVILLE, Tenn. - A Clarksville woman has called for an investigation after what she said was a vicious attack on her helpless pet Friday morning.

Emily Pryor of Clarksville said two pit bulls from her neighbor's yard got around a fence and mauled her Jack Russell terrier to death.

She said another neighbor who ran out to stop the attack was also bit.

She said she's looking for the Montgomery County Animal Control to take action to make sure the pit bulls don't put any other pets, or humans, in danger.

No one answered the door at the home where the pit bulls were said to live Monday.

Montgomery County Animal Control was also on scene, taking pictures of the backyard, but folks at the office said they're still looking into what happened.
