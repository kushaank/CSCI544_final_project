STOCKTON - Today is the last day to register to vote if you want to cast a ballot in the June 3 election.

The paper forms would-be voters can pick up in libraries, post offices and some other places need to be put in the mail today.

But the post office closing won't be the final chance to register. Online registration will count for the June election until the very end of the day, at 11:59:59 p.m., according to the California Secretary of State's Office.

Even though today is the final day to register to vote, registered voters have until May 27 to request a vote-by-mail ballot.

Voters must reregister to vote after moving or changing their names. To check your status, go to sos.ca.gov/elections/registration-status.

To register online, go to registertovote.ca.gov.

For more information on registering, visit sos.ca.gov/elections/elections_vr.htm or the San Joaquin County Registrar of Voters website at sjcrov.org and at (209) 468-2885.
