WAYNESBORO, Va. (WHSV) -- A Virginia museum wants to open a satellite location in downtown Waynesboro, if it can acquire the necessary funding.

"It'll be a good piece of Virginia heritage for locals to see, as well," said Gregory Hitchin, the city's director of economic development.

However, a $50,000 price tag for the Virginia Museum of Natural History's master plan is slowing down the process. The Waynesboro City Council is expected to vote to pay up to half of that cost, but that still leaves $25,000 unpaid. The museum has launched a 21st century campaign for cash to help fill part of that gap.

"We need your help to make this happen," said VMNH Executive Director Joe Keiper, in a video posted on the museum's Kickstarter project page, which is trying to raise $10,000 to help pay for the plan.

"We will be an economic driver for your town. We need everyone to get involved in this," said Keiper.

Many people are excited for anything to come to Waynesboro that will bring more people downtown. Andy Tannenbaum said the city needs to be careful that adding the museum doesn't change the character of downtown Waynesboro.

Contributions on the museum's Kickstarter page begin at $1 and you have until June 12 to contribute.
