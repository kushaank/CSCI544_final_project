Scientists previously thought Oahu was the remnant of Wai'anae and Ko'olau.

Lead author John Sinton said in a statement: "Both of these assumptions can now be revised: Wai'anae is not as large as previously thought and Ka'ena Volcano formed in the region between Kaua'i and Wai'anae."

The new volcano is located near the western tip of O'ahu in a large region called the Ka'ena Ridge.

In 2010, scientists found unusual lavas from Wai'anae. Sinton said in a statement: "We previously knew that they formed by partial melting of the crust beneath Wai'anae, but we didn't understand why they have the isotopic composition that they do.

"Now, we realise that the deep crust that melted under Waianae is actually part of the earlier Ka'ena Volcano."

Researchers found that data relating to the age, geochemistry and geological observations of Ka-ena showed it was not part of Wai'anae, but an earlier volcanic structure, which Wai'anae was built on.

"What is particularly interesting is that Ka'ena appears to have had an unusually prolonged history as a submarine volcano, only breaching the ocean surface very late in its history," Sinton said in a statement.
