Brandon Frey co-owns  Two Rascals Brewery  in Montrose. It opened in 2012.

“We get a lot of people that are traveling through that are basically going around the entire state of Colorado trying to visit as many microbreweries as they can," Frey said. "It’s nice for the craft beer industry that people are making their vacations around just stopping at different breweries and trying different stuff."

The study also found the industry employees about 5,000 people in Colorado.

Two Rascals Brewery in Montrose opened in 2012.

“As far as employees go, it’s just me and my business partner Daniel Leonardi," he said. "With our new expansion and hope to start distributing [soon] we’re going to have to hire probably another five to 10 people to keep up with demand."

King said between his brewery and tasting room, he employs six people.

Kings said he thinks the industry will continue to grow.
