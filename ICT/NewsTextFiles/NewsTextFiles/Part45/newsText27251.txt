Arizona Pest Control warns the public to be aware of rattlesnakes and offers tips in the event of a rattlesnake bite, which is potentially fatal.

Rattlesnakes can be found anywhere, but commonly find shelter among brush and rocks, or venture out onto roads and streets to absorb the warmth into their bodies at night or when the weather cools, officials said.

The most common snakes include the Northern Pacific Rattler, Western Diamond Back, Sidewinder, Speckled Rattlesnake, Red Diamond Rattler, Southern Pacific, Great Basin and Mohave Rattlesnake.
