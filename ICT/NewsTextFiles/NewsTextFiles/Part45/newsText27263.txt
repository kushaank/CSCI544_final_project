
Missouri pro-lifers are waiting to see how Governor Jay Nixon handles the latest pro-life bill to emerge from the legislature.

Current Missouri law requires a 24-hour waiting period before an abortion. But Pam Fichter, president of Missouri Right to Life , explains the new law would require a 72-hour wait.

"This is such an important decision and it's a decision that could end the life of a child, could endanger the health and future of the mother," she tells OneNewsNow, "and we just feel that we should provide as much protection and as much opportunity for a woman to consider all of her options as possible."

The MRL president adds the measure will save the lives of babies and "protect women from abortion clinics seeking to make a profit on an abortion."

Missouri has legislation in place requiring women be given information on abortion and the possible negative consequences. The 72-hour bill now sits on the desk of Governor Nixon, who is pro-abortion. Under Missouri law, the governor has three options.

"He can sign it, which he won't do. He can veto it – which if he does, I think there's a very good possibility the veto would be overturned," explains Fichter. "Or he can just let it ride and ignore it – and in that situation it will automatically become law after a certain amount of time after it comes to his desk."

The pro-life leader points out that under the new law, women would not be prohibited or otherwise restricted from getting an abortion; they would just have more time to think about it.

The legislation's bill numbers are SCS HCS HB 1307 and 1313. It passed the state Senate on a 22-9 vote; the House approved it 115-39.
