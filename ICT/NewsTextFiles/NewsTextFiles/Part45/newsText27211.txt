Expert notes extreme drought in wildfire outlook. 9NEWS at 9 p.m., 5/18/14.

DENVER - Experts are still expecting a normal fire season in Colorado this year but normal means we could see as many as 3500 fires.

Einar Jensen, a life safety expert with South Metro Fire, says an average to normal fire season can bring huge fires that rage for days.

Jensen says he's looking to the U.S. Drought Monitor to learn more about the state's landscape. According to the monitor, roughly 45 percent of Colorado is not experiencing drought.  In southeastern Colorado experts are seeing extreme to exceptional drought.

Jensen adds that in hot and dry environments vegetation dries out more quickly, leaving fast-burning fuel for fires.  After a rain, Jensen says your lawn can dry out in as quickly as an hour.

When comparing Colorado to the Southern California, where fires have raged for several days, Jensen says our risk is somewhat mitigated.

"We don't have the dense population and we don't have the vegetation that would create mega fires," Jensen says.  "Certainly grass, prairie conditions, crops can burn. And like we had several years ago with our last chance fire, we can have a fire that rips over several hours but it's not in a densely populated area."

Even with a comparatively lower risk, we have seen fires destroy communities here in Colorado. Last June, the Black Forest Fire destroyed more than 500 homes.
