
Louie Pumps For EPA Secretary!

Tempting, but wrong!

We should employ a bit of Sonny’s counterintuitive smarts in the case at hand as well.

Rather than calling for the head of this anonymous EPA bureaucrat — henceforth referred to herein as Louie Pumps — those of us who dream of living in a free society should be setting up a private fund to cover whatever costs might be incurred in sending Pumps out to hold surreptitious porn viewing seminars for the employees for any and all federal agencies willing to host him.

After all, a motivated, true believer operating the largely unaccountable wheels and cogs of the regulatory apparatus can probably inflict $120,000 worth of damage to our collective dreams, aspirations, and future prosperity before lunch on a “good” day.

That man, my friends, is a deep cover freedom fighter.

And if he keeps his job, like Calogero, we got out of it cheap.

Which is to say, Chaffetz and other supposed proponents of limited government in Congress should think long and hard about what, precisely, their endgame is in terminating Louie Pumps. Filling his oh-gawd-I-don’t-even-want-to-know-what-that-stain-is shoes with a starry-eyed “serve the state!” stickler for enforcing and promulgating already suffocating red tape hardly seems the best way to nurture a laissez-faire philosophy.
