
COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - The auto club AAA says about 1.34 million Ohioans will travel at least 50 miles from home over the long Memorial Day weekend. That would be the most since before the recession.

AAA says the travel volume - which would be about 0.6 percent higher than the Memorial Day weekend a year ago in the state - is due to an improved economy and more people wanting to get out of town after the long, cold winter.

About 90 percent of Ohioans traveling - or about 1.2 million - are expected to drive to their destinations. Gas prices aren't expected to be a factor because they're in line with last year.

AAA expects 36.1 Americans to travel from Thursday through Monday.
