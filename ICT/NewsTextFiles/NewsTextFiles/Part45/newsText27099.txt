
Following the release of national reports on climate change, Allegheny County Health Department officials are examining how best to prepare for the changes they say are imminent over the coming decades.

Speakers at a half-day conference outlined how climate change has affected the state and region, and showed graphs of how it could possibly affect the climate in the future. For example, higher humidity levels could lead to more dust mites and other insects that can trigger allergies; precipitation may become more intense, affecting sewage overflows into the rivers; and the distribution of infectious diseases could shift. The purpose of this conference was to start a conversation on how to be prepared for any health risks that may arise.

Portlock said it will be critical to ensure that as long-term climate changes occur, public health is protected.

“Really a very important aspect of dealing with climate change is simply adapting to it,” said Dr. Raymond Najjar, with Penn State. Najjar outlined climate projections for Pennsylvania, which show the state could get warmer, have more precipitation in the form of rain, and that precipitation could be more intense.

Regardless of efforts to mitigate effects of climate change, several of the speakers said the course has been set and changes are inevitable, it will just be a matter of how severe the changes are in the future.
