
Residents concerned about plans for a 37-lot development off Southwest West Hills Road met for the second time Monday night with the developers.

Daytime TV icon Ellen DeGeneres raised a ruckus in Corvallis over the weekend with a message on her Twitter account suggesting she was coming to town this week.

The suggestive tweet had the Twittersphere and social media sites such as Facebook buzzing with rumors that DeGeneres was planning a personal visit to the Corvallis campus, and by Sunday the rumor had morphed to make it a joint appearance with the popular British pop-rock band Coldplay.

Reality turns out to be a little less exciting and more promotional.

“On Wednesday ‘The Ellen DeGeneres Show’ will be doing a live Twitter event from its studio in Burbank, California, with Oregon State University students,” OSU spokeswoman Annie Heck said Monday.

The band is in the midst of a world tour to promote the new release. Wednesday’s appearance on “Ellen” is sandwiched between sold-out concert dates in Los Angeles and Glasgow, Scotland.

Melissa Little Padgitt, a publicist for the DeGeneres show, said via email that Wednesday’s program would be videotaped for broadcast the following week, May 28.

Padgitt said the Twitter event would involve only students from Oregon State University but declined to provide any additional details, saying that information would be parceled out via DeGeneres’ Twitter account, @TheEllenShow.

“The Ellen DeGeneres Show” airs locally at 3 p.m. Monday-Friday on KGW-TV, Channel 8.

She is the kind of person that would come to Oregon just to satisfy the rumor. I wouldn't be surprised if this came up on her show in the next couple of days.
