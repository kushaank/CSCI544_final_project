
ALBUQUERQUE (KRQE) – Some new regulations proposed by the state could raise the costs of the medical marijuana program for both patients and producers.

About 11,000 New Mexicans who are legally able to buy medical marijuana could soon have to pay a $50 yearly fee.

That fee would go to help pay for the agency’s operational costs.

According to the Albuquerque Journal , producers will face higher costs depending on how many plants they grow as well. The proposed new rules would triple the cost of producers’ annual licensing fees from $30,000 to $90,000 according to the number of plants grown.

A Department of Health official says that the new rules will only apply to producers who grow the maximum number of plants.
