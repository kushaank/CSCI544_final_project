
BLOOMINGTON — The search continues for a Bloomington man now missing for more than a week.

Officials say Dan Gaines, 59, left his west side home about 12:45 p.m. May 12, apparently on his bicycle. He has not been seen since.

"We are still continuing to investigate and we are still getting some leads and possible sightings, and we follow up on all of those, but we have not yet been able to find him," McLean County Sheriff Mike Emery said Monday. "We are talking with family, friends and co-workers and we are still hoping we have a successful outcome on this case."

Officials from several different departments assisted with the search last week. Tuesday was the most extensive search as the McLean County Emergency Management Agency, and members of the Illinois Search and Rescue Council assisted local departments, but did not find Gaines or his bicycle.

"He was known to ride 40 or 50 miles at a time on his bike, so that makes it complicated because the search area is now so wide," Emery said.

The public is asked to contact law enforcement with any new leads or clues. Gaines is described as white, 6 feet 3 inches tall and weighing about 200 pounds. He was wearing a gray T-shirt and shorts and was believed to be riding a silver Mongoose bicycle.

Gaines, who works for State Farm, has been listed as a missing person with state and national law enforcement databases. Anyone with information is asked to contact the sheriff's department at 309-888-5030.

I agree.  This is so sad.  Does anyone know if he had a mobile phone with him?  If so, did that give the authorities any leads?   Is there anything that we, the public can do to help in this search?  Please tell us what we can do.
