
In a paper published in the journal PNAS, a team of social and behavior scientists investigated the statistical likelihood that people will marry someone with a similar genotype.

A study of white married couples in the U.S. -- the majority of who were born in the 1930s -- concluded that spouses are more genetically similar to each other than they are to random individuals.

"The genetic similarity, or lack thereof, between spouses is less well understood," authors wrote.

Study authors based their conclusion on data from 9,429 non-Hispanic white individuals in the ongoing Health and Retirement Study , which is sponsored by the National Institute on Aging.

The sample included 825 spousal pairs who were all born between 1920 and 1970. Fifty-nine percent were born during the 1930s, authors wrote.

Study authors said that while they did find that married couples wereÂ  more genetically similar than randomly generated pairs of people in the same population, this similarity was just one-third the magnitude of educational similarity between spouses.
