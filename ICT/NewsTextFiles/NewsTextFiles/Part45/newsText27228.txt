
A former U.S. official says the Obama administration's North Korea policy has failed.

In an interview with South Korea's Yonhap News Agency,  Evans Revere, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution said the U.S. has set its focus too squarely on suspending the regime's nuclear development, knowing full well that Pyongyang has no intention of ever giving up its nuclear arms.

The former diplomat, who is experienced in negotiating with the North, said Washington's policy is too passive, and he called for more pressure and stronger sanctions.

He added the six-party denuclearization talks -- involving the two Koreas, the U.S., China, Japan and Russia -- have lost their original objective due to Pyongyang's unwillingness to compromise.
