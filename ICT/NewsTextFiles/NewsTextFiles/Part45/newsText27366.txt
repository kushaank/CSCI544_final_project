Students enrolled in each program received the program's winning book, "Grumpy Bird," at a special event held two weeks ago. One Book 4 Colorado is co-hosted by Reach Out and Read Colorado, Colorado State Library, Lt. Governor Joe Garcia and Denver Preschool Program. The program donated over 75,000 books that were given to local libraries, preschools and doctor's offices. Books were distributed to preschool students by the Las Animas/Bent County Library.

The library offered a special story time for students at each of the learning centers and distributed approximately 100 books locally. For more information on One Book 4 Colorado, visit their website at www.onebook4colorado.org.

In addition to the book distribution, the Las Animas/Bent County Library will be hosting a Summer Reading Program June 4 through July 23. Children between the ages of 3 and 6 years are encouraged to attend on Wednesdays from 10:30 to 11:30 a.m. Youth between the ages of 7 and 12 years are encouraged to attend on Wednesdays from 1:20 to 2:30 p.m. There will be programs with guest speakers, special events and entertainers.
