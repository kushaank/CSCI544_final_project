assesses such fees.

"We found no letters, correspondence, memorandums of understanding or other documents pertaining to the impact fees," Charles wrote. "No deposition transcripts were included."

Charles concluded that "for the most part, Gardel simply assumed that Shadow Creek was responsible for paying impact fees based upon its willingness to do so between 2003 and 2006." Charles noted that clear title, insured by a title insurance company, was conveyed by Shadow Creek to Gardel.

"If in fact the failure to pay impact fees could somehow be considered as creating a lien or encumbrance, why would a title insurance carrier issue a policy to insure title on all of the conveyed lots?" Charles asked.

"In our opinion, a factual issue exists with respect to whether Shadow Creek could be deemed legally responsible to pay the impact fees that form the basis of this litigation," Charles wrote, in declining to award summary judgment.
