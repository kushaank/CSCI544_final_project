
The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) welcomes the leading cybersecurity response experts from around the world to the 26th Annual FIRST Conference.

There is no other global event where InfoSec teams from government, global corporations and elite educational institutions gather to openly share the successes and failures of the past year. This conference will feature three parallel tracks, offering many opportunities for information security novices, experts and managers to engage in meaningful conversation and learn from relevant incident handling topics and ideas.

This year over 500 attendees and 60 speakers will travel from over 50 countries and include more than 300 FIRST Member Teams, such as: Intel, Cisco, Microsoft, Deutsche Bank, Symantec, Siemens, eBay, Hewlett Packard, CERT/CC, BT, Hitachi, Google, IBM, NATO, Facebook, Juniper Networks and University of Oxford.
