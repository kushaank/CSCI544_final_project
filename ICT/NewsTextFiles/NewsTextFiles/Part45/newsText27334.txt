Wellesley, Massachusetts-based Brightfield Development LLC plans to build a $65 million, 20-megawatt solar farm at the site.

Alcoa, the city of East St. Louis and the Alton and Southern Railroad are responsible for the cleanup of the site, which includes placing a 2-foot soil cover over about 120 acres, the Belleville News-Democrat reports.

Construction of the project is expected to continue through the summer of 2015.
