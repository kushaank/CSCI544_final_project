
Horsham Township is seeking a grant to develop a marketing plan for itself.

By a 5-0 vote May 14, the township council adopted a resolution to participate in the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commisison’s Transportation and Community Development Initiative grant program.

Township Manager William Walker referred to the funding as a “planning grant.” He said many municipalities these days were adopting marketing strategies.

Walker noted that the township had been ranked nationally as a good place to live.

“A lot of other communities are saying that, too,” he added.

“We live in a very competitive environment,” said Walker, noting Dow Chemical’s relocation to Collegeville from Spring House last year. He added that the township had to do the best job it could to market itself.

Walker said the township would find out at the end of September if its grant application had been successful. If so, he added, Horsham would enter into a contract with the DVRPC under which the township would have to come up with 20 percent matching funds.

“We have to be done the plan in two years,” Walker said.

Township resident Justin Emrich asked what kinds of strings were attached to the grant money.

Speaking after the meeting, Walker said that the amount of the grant could be up to $100,000.

Money for the program came from a combination of state and federal sources, the website indicated. It also said that TCDI planning grants had totaled $12.4 million to 140 communities in the 10 years through 2012.

A March 5 press release on the commission’s website reported that $2.2 million in TCDI grants were available, of which $1.2 million would be for communities in Pennsylvania. The application deadline is May 30.

“Selection is made by review committees that are established for each state and represent county, state, non-profit, academic, and citizen interests. Each committee meets and then presents a recommended list of projects to the DVRPC Board for approval,” the press release explained.

Walker replied that the township would not have any further obligation to the commission, once the plan was completed.
