The ANASAZI Way is a way of “walking” in the wilderness and in life. Commencing in 1968, Larry D. Olsen and Ezekiel C. Sanchez gleaned and developed the ANASAZI Way from years of trial, error, and experience walking in nature with thousands of young people. They attribute their learning and awakenings to the Creator, their families, perceptive Young Walkers, discerning parents, and their associates at ANASAZI. The principles in the Official Statement and the Ten Guiding Principles constitute the foundation of the ANASAZI Way.

Mission Statement - it is the mission of ANASAZI Foundation to prepare parents and children to turn their hearts to one another, begin anew, and walk in harmony in the wilderness of the world.
