Proteon Therapeutics , a biotechnology firm founded in Kansas City, has obtained $45 million in equity financing that includes $25 million to proceed with a Phase III clinical trial.

The privately owned firm, now based in Waltham, Mass., has developed a drug designed to reduce blood vessel blockage in dialysis patients who have chronic kidney disease.

Blockage is a common problem for people who have had surgery to create a dialysis access site known as an arteriovenous fistula.

The drug, PRT-201, has been in development for a decade. Proteon was founded in 2001 by Nicholas Franano and Bill Whitaker, who launched the enterprise with $50,000.

Novartis AG , a pharmaceutical giant, had considered but declined to exercise a $550 million option agreement to buy Proteon this year.

The new financing round was led by Abingworth LLP , an investment group focused on life science and health care firms.
