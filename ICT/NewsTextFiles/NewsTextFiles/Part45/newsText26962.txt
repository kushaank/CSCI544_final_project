JONESBORO, AR  (KAIT) – A conversation about children respecting each other escalated to a charge of aggravated assault, according to a Jonesboro Police report.

According to Jonesboro Police Officer Jonathan Rinehart, Amy Elumbaugh, 30, of Jonesboro was charged with aggravated assault after being accused of trying to run over a man with her truck.

According to the report, Gail Washington and Lorrenzo Hampton got into an argument with Elumbaugh Sunday afternoon. Washington and Hampton said Elumbaugh cursed at their children as they were on the playground.

Two children said they didn't like the way two other children were "staring at them", eventually leading to a fight between them. Two children then ran home to get their mother, who came back in a maroon pickup truck.

Lorrenzo claimed Elumbaugh cursed at the children and began to argue with him, according to the report. Lorrenzo told officers that Elumbaugh was about to punch him when her children told her to stop. She then got into her truck and made a 360 degree turn at high speed. Lorrenzo and Washington told police they thought Elumbaugh tried to hit them.

After interviewing Lorrenzo and Washington, police questioned Elumbaugh. She told officers that she was on her lunch break when her children told her what happened on the playground. Elumbaugh then told officers that she drove to the playground when Lorrenzo "got in her face." According to the report, she said she was about to punch Lorrenzo when she heard her children not to. She then claimed to have gotten inside her truck and sped off. Elumbaugh admitted she had to turn the steering wheel in order to miss Washington and Lorrenzo.

Elumbaugh is awaiting a probable cause hearing.
