
148MW wind project in Aroostook County, Maine, expected to commence commercial operation in late 2015.

Payment is the first of several that will provide $12 million to the town of Oakfield over a period of 20 years.

The US Energy Department has recognised the nation's first grid-connected offshore floating wind turbine prototype off the coast of Castine, Maine.

Latest order entails 48 V112-3.0 MW turbines for Maine's 'Oakfield' project.

The new order--the fourth deal between First Wind and Vestas and the second Maine project--is a call-off on the master supply agreement (MSA) announced in December 2013 for multiple U.S. projects, the potential of which totals 718 MW. With this latest order, Vestas has secured 298 MW under this MSA.  Vestas V112-3.0 MW turbines will be supplied for this project.

The deal will also include a 10-year Active Output Management (AOM) 5000 service agreement, an energy-based availability guarantee that ensures the turbines are operational when the wind is blowing. This service option includes the VestasOnline® surveillance system that remotely controls and monitors the turbines and minimises lost production by predicting when maintenance may be required.

First Wind CEO Paul Gaynor said he is pleased to continue the construction of the Oakfield Wind project, and he looks forward to installing Vestas’ V112-3.0 MW turbines on the site. ""The Vestas turbines at our Bull Hill project in Maine and the Palouse project in Washington State have performed well, and we expect the Oakfield project to enjoy similar success."

Deliveries for the Oakfield project will take place in the 2nd quarter of 2015, with commissioning expected by the 4th quarter of 2015.
