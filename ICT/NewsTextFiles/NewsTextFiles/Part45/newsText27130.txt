JACKSON, Miss. (AP) - A Neshoba County man is pleading guilty to having sex with a girl younger than 12.

Brandon Keith Farmer , 20, made the plea Friday before Senior U.S. District Judge Tom Lee in Jackson.

The man faced federal charges because he is a member of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians and the sexual contact took place in early 2013 on the Pearl River section of the Choctaw reservation.

A grand jury indicted Farmer in March on five counts of abusive sexual contact with a minor.

Farmer will be sentenced July 31. He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison and a $250,000.00 fine.
