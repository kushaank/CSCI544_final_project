
Candidate for Governor Mike Ross was in Warren Tuesday evening for a dinner and fundraiser.  A large crowd was on hand at the home of Mayor Bryan and Dr. Sue Martin to greet the former Congressman and to help him raise funds for the campaign.  According to the campaign the event was very successful.

Ross visits with Roger George at the fundraising event.

Thirty individuals or couples sponsored the dinner and Mr. Ross addressed the crowd and talked about his vision for Arkansas.  He stressed his Arkansas heritage and business and political background. He said he got fed up with partisan politics on the national level but has a strong desire for public service in Arkansas.  The former congressman outlined a program of strong public education including pre-k for all children, job creation, lower and fairer taxes to be implemented in a prudent fashion, and stated firmly he was running to be the Governor for all of Arkansas not for a political party.  He also stressed the importance of supporting our hospitals and medical care givers.

Candidate Ross speaks with Dr. Robert Smalling.

While visiting with those in attendance he voiced strong support for the Human Development Centers that serve the mentally handicapped.  Warren is home to one of the five centers located in Arkansas.

Mr. Ross said he would be back in Warren very soon to attend the Pink Tomato Festival.
