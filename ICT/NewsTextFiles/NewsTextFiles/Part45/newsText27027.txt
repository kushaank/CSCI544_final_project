
At this time of year, when you drive past a pond in Vermont, you'll hear the familiar sound of spring peepers. On this first edition of Outdoor Radio, biologists Kent McFarland and Sara Zahendra are at the Marsh Billings Rockefeller National Historic Park in Woodstock, Vermont to explain how that sound is like standing near a jet engine. We'll also learn about how peepers make that sound and the amazing way they survive the winter.
