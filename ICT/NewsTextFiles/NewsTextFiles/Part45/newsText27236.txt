
Springfield city officials released their budget recommendation for the 2015 fiscal year on Monday morning.

Mayor Domenic Sarno was joined by the city's financial officers to unveil the $582 million plan.

That is a 1.8 percent increase over the 2014 budget.

Officials say the proposal addresses a $22 million deficit and avoids layoffs, while preserving core services.

They add the additional money is coming from the state, allowing the city to keep from raising taxes.

The proposal now goes to the city council for potential approval.
