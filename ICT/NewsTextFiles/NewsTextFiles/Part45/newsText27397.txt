
Months ahead of her high school prom, one Connecticut teen knew exactly who would be her dream date: Vice President Joe Biden.

She warned that if the vice president didn’t accept her invitation, she’d be forced to ask out House Speaker John Boehner instead, The Hartford Courant  reported.

“And we can’t have that now can we,” she teased in the letter.

But instead of her date showing up at her front door, Maselli received a delivery of a corsage of roses and a note handwritten by the vice president himself.

As it turns out, Maselli, now 18, did not attend her prom. But had 71-year-old Biden agreed to escort her, she said she would have gone.
