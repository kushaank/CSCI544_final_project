COLUMBUS, Ohio -- A revised petition to funnel $1.3 billion to “clean energy” projects was rejected Monday because petitioners did not collect enough valid signatures to move to the next phase of the process.

Attorney General Mike DeWine rejected revised constitutional amendment language submitted by Yes for Ohio’s Energy Future for failing to net 1,000 signatures of Ohio voters.

Of the 1,504 signatures collected in Cuyahoga and Lucas counties, only 836 were deemed valid.

The proposed amendment would require $1.3 billion be spent over 10 years on infrastructure, research and site development for solar, wind, geothermal and other energy sources. The Ohio Energy Initiative Commission — a limited liability company registered in the state of Delaware — would decide how the money would be spent without help from state lawmakers.

The new amendment language is nearly identical to the first, but it specifies that $65 million is to be transferred from the state treasury within 60 days of the amendment’s adoption. The group first began collecting signatures for a ballot initiative in March 2012.

Calls seeking comment from organizers were not immediately returned Monday afternoon.

The LLC was registered by Harvard Business Services, Inc., in January 2012, according to Delaware Division of Corporation records. Delaware does not require the names and addresses of LLC members and managers to be made public.
