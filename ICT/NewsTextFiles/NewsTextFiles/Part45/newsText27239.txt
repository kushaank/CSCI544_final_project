
(Tunica, MS) Wesley Leathers liked getting free garbage pickup for years from the Town of Tunica.

Soon, it’s likely he’ll have to pay $10 a month for the privilege of having the Town of Tunica pick up his garbage.

The town’s mayor says the city’s dwindling finances made the new fee necessary.

”With revenue down and because we want to have the utility fund be more self-sufficient, the Board of Aldermen did enact the first garbage fee,” Mayor Chuck Cariker said.

He also said aldermen will vote on it Tuesday night, and it will likely show up on bills by August.

The fees may not end with garbage.

With less casino tax money coming in and a fight with finances with the county, Tunica leaders are looking at other fees to bring in more money to the town.

Cariker says water rates may go up too, not just for the town but for a big chunk of the county the town serves.

But he promises customers will get their money’s worth.

And even though it might cost a little more than some places, Wesley Leathers says it’s less than others.
