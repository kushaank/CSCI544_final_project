
Sharon and John Bente were asleep in their Bradenton home when an alligator broke into their backyard and entered the pool. ‘It is a fun story and hopefully it just won't happen again,’ Sharon said.

A Florida couple received a surprise guest in her pool last week.

An 8-foot-long alligator took a swim in their pool in the middle of the night Thursday, reports TV Station WWSB.

"I saw something that is not usually in the pool along with the little floaty, and it turned out to be an eight-foot alligator," Bradenton resident Sharon Bente told the station.

Her first thought was self-preservation.

"Can I get back to the door without it seeing me or realizing I'm bait?" she said.

She immediately went upstairs to wake up her husband John and tell him the news.

"He was just swimming around in circles. ... I think he was a little intimidated with everybody watching too," John told the station. "It was quite an evening, quite an evening."

WWSB Sharon Bente was surprised to find an alligator had entered her pool last week in Bradenton Fla.

A trapper removed the alligator who was brought to a gator farm in Arcadia, the station reported.

"And it turns out we just had a few screens that needed repairing and it is a great story, it is a fun story and hopefully it just won't happen again," Sharon said.
