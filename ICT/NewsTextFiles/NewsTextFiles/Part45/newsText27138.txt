
Rolf Harris told a girl of 11 he wanted to be the first person to give her a ‘tongue kiss’, a court heard today.

The alleged victim was at a family friend’s home and off sick from school when she came downstairs in her pyjamas.

The woman said the incident happened in Australia in 1969.

She said: ‘He put his tongue in my mouth and gave me a tongue kiss.

The woman rejected a suggestion by Harris’s barrister, Sonia Woodley QC, that she could have confused the incident with an attack by her cousin when she was 17.

Another alleged victim said she thought she was going to be raped when Harris pinned her against a wall and gave her a ‘slobbery’ kiss.

The woman told how she met the Australian entertainer, now 84, while on holiday in Malta as an 18-year-old in 1970.

She alleged he took her into a side room, where he kissed and groped her.

The women were called as prosecution witnesses and are not among four others who accuse Harris of 12 counts of indecent assault between 1968 and 1986.

Harris, from Bray in Berkshire, denies all charges. The trial at Southwark crown court continues.
