MAYFIELD TWP, MI -- The Valley Area Agency on Aging will host a legislative forum for seniors from 10 a.m. to noon Monday, June 16, at Mayfield Township Hall, 1900 N. Saginaw Road in Mayfield Township near Lapeer.

At the forum, seniors will discuss ballot initiatives, local concerns and statewide issues like renewing senior citizen millages at the local level to electing representatives that will speak on behalf of seniors in Lansing.

"Being an informed voter is vitally important. It is essential that voters understand all the issues and elect people who will have senior citizens' best interest in mind when considering future legislation that impacts quality of life concerns," said Kathryn Boles, executive director of VAAA.
