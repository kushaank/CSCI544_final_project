
Luzerne County Manager Robert Lawton has nominated Charleston, S.C., resident Tanis Manseau as operational services division head.

Council confirmation is required for the hiring to take effect.

During a public introduction of Manseau in the courthouse rotunda this afternoon, Lawton said the hiring would complete the filling of eight division head positions required by the home rule government that took effect in January 2012.

“I’m really happy to have the senior team filled out,” Lawton said.

Manseau would receive $85,000 to oversee engineering, roads and bridges, recreation, planning/zoning, emergency management, security and buildings and grounds.

Manseau has a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering and is a licensed professional engineer in South Carolina, eligible for similar licensing in Pennsylvania.

He has 35 years of public and private sector experience in construction, project and facilities management and energy engineering. His prior employment included work as energy manager for the Charleston Naval Weapons Station, facilities operations director at the Medical University of South Carolina, facilities management director at the Trident Technical College and chief project/facilities engineer at the College of Charleston.

Manseau said he is “ecstatic” to be here and applied because he has experience in all areas listed in the county’s job description.

Lawton said Manseau will serve as interim operational services division head until council votes on the nomination.

The county has relied on temporary operational division heads since Chris Belleman left the position in September to become county Flood Protection Authority executive director.
