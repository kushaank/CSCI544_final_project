NEW YORK--Natural gas prices ticked up Monday as warming forecasts for early June suggested the first unseasonable bump in demand in several weeks.

Natural gas for June delivery is up 7 cents, or 1.6%, at $4.483 a million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The climb pushed natural gas near its highest price in a week.

Weather forecasts are showing some of the first sustained heat of the year, with warmer-than-normal conditions spreading across most of the country through the next two weeks. Forecasts for early June pushed higher over the weekend, predicting temperatures in the 80s from Houston to Boston. That could lead to gas-fired electricity powering air conditioners three weeks before the official start of summer.

"It definitely does mean we'll see elevated cooling demand at the end of the (May), more so than had been expected," said Phil Vida, lead forecaster at MDA Weather Services. "But ... it doesn't push temperatures to anything excessive."

It's enough for traders, who are ready to jump on any prospect of above-average heat to push up prices, said Gene McGillian, a broker and analyst at Tradition Energy. Natural gas stockpiles are half of what they usually are this time of year, so higher-than-average demand this summer could stretch supply.

"Everybody's waiting to see how it goes through Memorial Day," Mr. McGillian said. "If you start to see hot weather in June in the North and Northeast, in Texas, too, you're going to attract some" buyers.

Inventories now stand at about 1.2 trillion cubic feet, 46% below the five-year average. They are still low from high demand for home heating this winter, which had drained stockpiles to an 11-year low.

Physical gas for next-day delivery at the Henry Hub in Louisiana last traded at $4.52/mmBtu, compared with Friday's range of $4.42-$4.44. Cash prices at the Transco Z6 hub in New York traded in a bid-ask range of $3.10/mmBtu to $3.45/mmBtu, compared with Friday's range of $2.90 to $2.977.
