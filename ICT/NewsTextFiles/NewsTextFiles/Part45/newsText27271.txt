
In Socko, the employer conceded that it imposed the restrictive covenant on an existing employee without giving the employee any additional consideration in exchange for the non-compete agreement. The employer argued that, pursuant to the UWOA, the restriction could not be void for lack of consideration because the restriction was in an agreement signed by the employee with a clause providing that the employee “intended to be legally bound” by its terms. The Socko court disagreed, rejecting any erosion of the valuable consideration requirement for restrictive covenants not to compete.

The Socko holding reaffirms that Pennsylvania courts will examine whether employers that impose non-competes during existing employment relationships have provided adequate consideration. Potential forms of consideration include participation in training programs, a change in position, and an increase in compensation. Employers that wish to impose non-compete covenants on existing employees or modify existing restrictive covenants should evaluate these and other forms of potential consideration under existing Pennsylvania case law to ensure that the non-compete agreements are supported by adequate valuable consideration.
