
WESTON, W.Va. (AP) â€” Workers at a state-run psychiatric hospital in Weston are holding a protest to urge state officials to comply with a court ruling.

Members of West Virginia Public Workers Union UE Local 170 have scheduled an informational picket Monday at the entrance to William R. Sharpe Hospital.

The state Department of Health and Human Resources is facing a June 11 deadline to come up with a plan to address staffing shortages and other issues at the hospital and at Mildred Mitchell-Bateman Hospital in Huntington.

Kanawha County Circuit Court Judge Louis "Duke" Bloom ordered the DHHR to develop a comprehensive plan in April.

Bloom's order came in a case originally filed in 1981. Known as the Hartley case, it centers on the treatment of mental health patients.
