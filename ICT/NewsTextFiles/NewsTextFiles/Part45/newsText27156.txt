
In an exciting turn of events, the iconic Look Good Feel Better (LGFB) program has chosen to celebrate its silver anniversary at the highly acclaimed 2014 National Women’s Survivors Convention in Nashville, TN.

The celebration will kick off on Friday night (August 1, 2014) with an unprecedented live streaming program simulcast to thousands worldwide.  LGFB will then be participating in the entire convention from beginning to end and are the exclusive sponsor of THIS is the NEW ME beauty makeovers.  This is a designated area filled with experienced make-up artists and well respected hair stylists, each dedicated to providing the ultimate makeover for hundreds of women attending the convention.

Look Good Feel Better is a free public service program devoted to helping women who are undergoing cancer treatment.  Far more than just a source of wigs, scarves, and accessories, LGFB is about nurturing and transforming the self-image of women who are battling cancer.   Maintaining positive self-esteem and confidence during treatment can go a long way to easing the process and increasing the chances of success.

LGFB has a number of initiatives running this year in addition to their sponsorship of the National Women’s Survivors Convention.

Use the online Makeover Tool as a way to experience LGFB virtually. Participants can share both their image and story via social media for the chance to win an exclusive prize to join us in Nashville.

The 25th Anniversary Video is a simple way to share information about LGFB with family, friends, and coworkers.

A special series of Guest Blog Posts is being released on the LGFB blog to showcase the impact of the program.

A new Healthcare Provider Toolkit will be launched to ensure healthcare providers are aware of the program.
