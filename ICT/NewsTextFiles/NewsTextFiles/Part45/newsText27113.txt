
People For the American Way Action Fund has announced an endorsement of Derek Cressman’s candidacy for California Secretary of State.

Cressman is one of five primary candidates for Secretary of State.  He served as director of the Democracy Program for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (U.S. PIRG) and the state PIRG organizations, fighting for the environment, open government, and fair elections.  He subsequently founded Earth Tones, an environmentally friendly communications company that donates 100 percent of its profits to environmental groups.

In 2006 Cressman began working with Common Cause on its groundbreaking voting rights and elections programs, eventually directing the organization’s Citizens United information campaign. While at Common Cause, Cressman led 35 state chapters as vice president for states. During his tenure, Common Cause expanded its coordination of grassroots organizing and advocacy on money in politics across all of its local chapters, pursuing local ordinances and referenda as a strategy to draw more attention to the issue.
