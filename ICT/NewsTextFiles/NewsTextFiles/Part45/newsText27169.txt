JERSEY CITY, N.J. (CBSNewYork) — Happy 40th birthday, Rubik’s Cube!

As WCBS 880’s Marla Diamond reported, to mark the anniversary of the invention of the iconic 1980s toy, Liberty Science Center in Jersey City has opened a “Beyond Rubik’s Cube” exhibit, which shows visitors the cube from concept to worldwide phenomenon.

The exhibit includes a robot that solves the Rubik’s Cube in one minute — and does a victory dance afterward. It also includes a “Solve Bar,” which photographs the cubes of players and then shows them how to solve them.

Matthew Gold, a child of the ’80s, said he was never able to solve the Rubik’s Cube.
