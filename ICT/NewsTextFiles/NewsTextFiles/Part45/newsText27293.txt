
GREENVILLE, NC (WITN) -- The owner of a dog that has been named the Ugliest Dog in Greenville wants to enter him in the World's Ugliest Dog contest in California next month.

Holly Chandler says "Peanut" was rescued last July in Washington after he was set on fire as a puppy, severely burned by his previous owners.

Chandler wants to use the national contest as a platform to bring awareness to animal abuse and the damage that it can cause.

"It will ... be about telling people his story and showing that we cannot stick our heads in the sand," said Chandler. "Animal abuse happens, it is time to face it and come together to stop it."

Chandler has set up a fund to raise money to help get "Peanut" to California for the contest. So far they have raised about 1/3 of the money needed for the trip.
