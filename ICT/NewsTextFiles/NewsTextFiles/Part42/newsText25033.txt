
The Norwegian Government has allocated $1.6m (10m Norwegian Krone) to promote safe schooling in the northern part of Nigeria.

The fund, according to the government, is also to help Chibok, Borno State, where over 200 female pupils of the Government Secondary School were abducted by the violent Islamic sect, Boko Haram, since April 14.

This was disclosed by the Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Børge Brende, during a protest over the girls’ abduction in Oslo, Norway, a statement by Skandik Afrik, said on Monday.

Brende, who received a delegation of the protesters, which included the Nigerian community in the country, said Norway would also consider providing humanitarian assistance for the refugees and internally displayed people in the area.

…while northerners stole and kept their loot in Arab banks; shame on all northerners!
