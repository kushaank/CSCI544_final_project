
Supreme Court of Pakistan issued orders to transfer the money acquired from the recent auction of 3G and 4G technology to government funds.

A petition was filed in this regard by Advocate Ali Raza Chugtai on behalf of petitioner Khurram Shahzad Chugtai. A three-member bench of the court headed by Justice Jawwad Khawaja disposed off the case after a hearing on Monday.

Justice Khawaja said that all public money should be used in the best interest of the masses. He said that elections were held successfully and public representatives were working in the country.

Justice Jawwad told the petitioner to inform the court if he gets any information regarding embezzlement in public funds and 3G and 4 G auction money.

Pakistan Electronic Media Authority (PEMRA) Chairman Ismail Shah informed the court that the auction of 3G and 4G spectrum was held on April 23, 2014. He also informed the court about the mechanism adopted for the auction.

When Justice Jawwad enquired where the money received from auction would go and what would be the mechanism of its use, the AG said that the money would be transferred to Universal Service Fund (USF).

Justice Jawwad remarked that the public money should go to the public account.

The judge said that if Rs 11 billion had been collected, they will not be transferred to the USF, adding that the USF had enough money.
