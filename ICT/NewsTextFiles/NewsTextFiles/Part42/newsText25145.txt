
The DAP today has hit out at former prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad over his comments that the party’s decision to field a Malay candidate in Teluk Intan was an act to “dupe the Malays”.

Its parliamentary leader Lim Kit Siang said Dr Mahathir’s comments on Dyana Sofya Mohd Daud  was not surprising as that is what he did during his tenure in office.

“I believe Malays, Chinese and Indians are not easily duped as they know their rights and dreams,” Kit Siang (pic) told reporters today morning at a market in Teluk Intan.

Dr Mahathir Mohamad yesterday said the DAP decision to field Dyana was an act to deceive the Malays.

“The action is mere window dressing and no high hopes (are placed on the candidate). If she wins, it is victory for them (DAP),” he was quoted as saying by Bernama, adding that Dyana had a high chance of winning as many Malays “were easily duped by such a move”.

Dyana, 27, is facing Gerakan president Datuk Mah Siew Keong, who is the Barisan Nasional candidate, at the by-election on May 31. If Dyana wins the by-election, she will be the first Malay DAP woman MP.

As Dyana’s family members are staunch Umno supporters, Dr Mahathir said he was disappointed with her as she did not come from a “pro-opposition family” where from young she would have been taught to hate Umno.

"As parents, Umno members should tell their children about Umno, its history and what it has done (for country and people), otherwise when they grow up, they will do as they please," he was quoted as saying.

Other Umno leaders have labelled the UiTM graduate a “traitor” for joining DAP, with Wanita Umno head Datuk Seri Shahrizat Abdul Jalil reminding Dyana she was a UiTM graduate. – May 20, 2014.
