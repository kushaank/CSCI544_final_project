
Multiple Grammy-winning South African group Ladysmith Black Mambazo will headline MTN Bushfire Festival later this month in Swaziland.

A celebration of live music, theatre, poetry, film, circus, dance and visual arts, the annual festival features artists from more than 10 African countries – as well as a good number of international performers.

Other popular names participating in the three-day festival, taking place from May 30 to June 1, include Spoek Mathambo, Oliver Mtukudzi, Muzart and Bongo Maffin.

Festival-goers will also get to experience a contemporary art exhibition titled, Swaziland Now! The programme will see local and international visual artists exploring the issues of contemporary Swaziland.

Mambazo’s Albert Mazibuko said they’re excited to be performing at the festival this year.

“When we received the invitation, we did a lot of thinking due to the many controversies that normally surround the festival, but we ultimately decided to go and provide our charm at the event.

The Bushfire festival, which began in 2006, has endured year to year in spite of local activists urging artists to boycott the event in protest against the Swazi kingdom’s government policies.

On this point, Mazibuko said: “We are well aware of what is happening and part of our thinking process was to decide whether or not honour the event.

“We then consulted many people, including various music organisations in SA, and they gave us the green light.

To counter this type of controversy, organisers have introduced a new segment called The Barn, a place where politics and social issues are discussed during the course of the festival.
