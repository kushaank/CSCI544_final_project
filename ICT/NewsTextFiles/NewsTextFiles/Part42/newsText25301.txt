Malteser International will support its local partners in Bosnia Herzegovina – the Embassy of the Order of Malta in the country and its network of Catholic churches – with a donation of $34,000 (25,000 Euros) for humanitarian relief to those most affected by the floods. Malteser International is also in contact with its Order of Malta partners in Serbia and planning an assessment and further relief measures.

Whole cities and villages in both countries are currently under water; many communities are still unreachable.
