
Nath, 19, had to pay $500 to enter the competition, in which she was announced as Miss Globe New Zealand 2014 on May 10 at the event in Papakura.

Lydia Smit of Morrinsville was crowned the overall winner.

However, when she called one of the organisers to ask what her prize was, she was instead asked if she had $3000 to cover her expenses for her trip to Turkey, where the Miss Globe International pageant will be held in June.

“I was shocked, I was like, ‘Aren’t you supposed to give me the money?’ They were like, ‘No,’ and asked if I had the three grand or not,” Nath told the New Zealand Herald .

She then called the chief executive of Face of Beauty International Ltd, Milagros Manuel, telling her that she could not come up with the money in such a short time. The pageant has already cost her over $1000 for her entry fee and her dress.

“She said, ‘Good, you don’t have the money. Give the crown and sash back, I have other girls lined up,’” Nath recounted.

When Nath went back to the organiser the following day, she was told that she wasn’t the real winner.

Nath is now seeking compensation for the entry fee she shelled out, including $420 for the 10 tickets that she sold, which is another condition of entry. She also wants apology from the organisers, saying she felt her reputation had been tarnished by the experienced.

As for the $3000 that the winner was asked to shoulder so they could compete overseas, Manuel claimed that contestants were told of the costs before they were crowned.
