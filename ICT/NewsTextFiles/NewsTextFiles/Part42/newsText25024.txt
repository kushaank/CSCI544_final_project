
The one crucial element in BJPâs historic 7-0 win in Delhi was the support it received from the minority community.

The party put in a lot of effort, right from organising conferences, holding public meetings, conducting door-to-door programmes to ensure the anti-Modi image created by the Congress and AAP was dismantled. The efforts seem to have yielded results.

Across all assembly segments, which are dominated by Muslims, BJP gained 5,000-25,000 votes in the recently held Lok Sabha elections.

Senior BJP leaders further said the results will boost the partyâs prospects if re-elections are held in Delhi assembly and they should continue to undertake such programmes.

The minority cell of the BJP played a crucial role in getting the support of Muslims.

For instance, in the Matia Mahal assembly segment, which is part of Chandni Chowk parliamentary constituency and is dominated by Muslims, Harsh Vardhan managed to get 15,453 votes against 6,061 votes the party had won in the 2013 assembly elections.

âWe had worked hard in areas dominated by Muslims and constituencies such as Seemapuri, Seelampur, Ghonda, Babarpur, Mustafabad, Okhla and Ballimaran. We have gained in Okhla too where the party candidate got 39,445 votes against 23,358 votes in the assembly election. It shows that the party is getting the support of the Muslim population and they believe in our agenda of positive governance,â said a senior BJP leader.

The minority cell of the Delhi BJP had also prepared a video of Narendra Modi, the partyâs face this election, highlighting the fact that he and the party is not anti-Muslim.

âTraditionally, Muslims are believed to be the vote bank of Congress but that notion has undergone a sea change. A number of Muslims, especially the youth, came out in huge number and supported us as we gave them the development model. Our minority cell held interactions and public meets to ensure more people came out and voted for our candidates,â said Atif Rashid, president of minority cell of Delhi BJP.
