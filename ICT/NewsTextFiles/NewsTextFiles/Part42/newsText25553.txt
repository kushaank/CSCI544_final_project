
Tsipras: May 25 Euro elections a 'referendum'

In a statement offered by main opposition Radical Left Coalition SYRIZA party Alexis Tsipras late on Sunday, he commented that the results of the first round of local administration elections for the candidates the party supported in the Attica prefecture, the Athens municipality, as well as a large number of other prefectures and municipalities, highlight SYRIZA as a strong power in local administration.

According to AMNA, for Tsipras, the results of the first round of elections paved a new way in local administration with no historical precedent, i.e. a government party left out of the second round of elections for Attica prefecture and Athens municipality, for which he expressed his conviction that both will "turn page" next Sunday.

In reaction to Premier Antonis Samaras' statement on the outcome of Sunday΄s first round of local administration elections, Tsipras noted that Samaras conceded that based on local administration ballot results, next Sunday΄s European Parliament elections jeopardizes the "memorandum government's" future, emphasizing that the European elections will become the referendum that never took place concerning the memoranda.

"Next Sunday will be the first day of a different era", stressed Tsipras, adding that Greece belongs to no one else, apart from its people.

"Next Sunday, our vote will not only count, but will change the country", he concluded in a play on (Greek) words.
