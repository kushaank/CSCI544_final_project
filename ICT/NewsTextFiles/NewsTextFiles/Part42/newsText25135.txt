KUALA LUMPUR: A new book released today claimed that the Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared on March 8, may have been mistakenly shot down during a military exercise.

‘Flight MH370: The Mystery’ is the first of perhaps many other books that touched on the disappearance of the plane.

According to news.com.au news portal, the book written by Nigel Cawthorne, claimed that the plane carrying 239 passengers was shot down during a US/Thailand military exercise.

He added that the mistake may have been covered up because authorities did not want any retaliatory attacks. He added that the data that sent the search mission from the Straits of Malacca to the southern Indian Ocean was a cover up.

Meanwhile, American aviation author Christine Negroni is also working on a book about the missing Malaysian flight entitled ‘Crashed’.

Earlier, two films inspired by the missing Malaysian Airlines' flight MH370 are being touted to buyers at the Cannes Film Festival , barely two months after the plane vanished with 239 people on board.

Potential buyers will get a sneak preview of "A Dark Reflection" by Fact Not Fiction Films at a "screening" on Monday, according to a full page advertisement in industry trade journal The Hollywood Reporter.
