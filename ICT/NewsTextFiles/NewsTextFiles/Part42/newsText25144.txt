
NEW YORK, NEW YORK - New York has enacted the law which will prevent people from buying cigarettes, tobacco products and e-cigarettes until they are 21.

The minimum age to buy cigarettes was raised on Sunday after a wait of six months.

The law was actually signed on November 19th shortly before former mayor Michael Bloomberg finished his second term.

When he introduced the law, he said it would be an initiative to encourage healthier behaviour among residents.

Storekeepers are now obliged to display signs that warn anyone under 21 about attempting to purchase tobacco products.

A valid ID is now required for proof of age.

Before they are able to hand over the cigarettes, shopkeepers have to scan IDs to ensure they are not fakes.

The measure, unprecedented in other large cities in the US, is New York's way of changing attitudes and reducing smoking in restaurants, bars, parks, beaches and other open spaces.

Some private residential buildings have also banned smoking.

When it comes to Iran's nuclear weapons program, the only difference between them is this: Ahmadinejad was a wolf in wolf's clothing, Rouhani is a wolf in sheep's clothing, a wolf who thinks he can pull the wool over the eyes of the international community.

The chief lobbyist for the National Retail Federation was speaking about talks to end the U.S. government shutdown.
