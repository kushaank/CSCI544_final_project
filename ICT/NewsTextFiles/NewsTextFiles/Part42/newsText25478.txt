
RECENTLY, a research on chemical pesticides used to fight plant epidemic, done by a chemical expert from MECA, was released in Science of the Total Environment Magazine, one of the well-known academic publishing. The research talks about chemical pesticides, health and environmental problems related to them, procedures of expired pesticides disposal, and ways to deal with empty pesticides cans.

He pointed out that all farms within the Association use high quality, high-priced, pesticides from global manufacturers. They also follow the right techniques in spraying, use appropriate quantities in specific time lines, follow instructions of safe period between spraying and harvesting, use healthy storage methods, and wisely dispose expired pesticides and empty cans.

“On the other hand, farms which don’t belong to the Association use poor quality, low-priced pesticides. Some of them even use banned types and ignore listed instructions. They don’t follow right storing methods or proper ways to dispose empty cans. They, instead, burn those cans and spread poisonous chemical substances all over the environment affecting specially humans and animals. Sometimes they reuse pesticides cans to restore drinks which doubles the danger and poisoning,” he added.

Al Zadjali asserted that the research results in general summarises farmers role in water, pesticides and fertilisers conservation. This leads to reduce pollution level and increase chemical free crops by early detection of plant diseases which enhances agricultural sustainable development. While farms which are managed by the expatriate manpower with their poor experience and not by farmers themselves will be sources of spreading chemical pesticides and this increase health and environmental problems.
