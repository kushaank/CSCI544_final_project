
Peter Dunne's overjoyed National's dropped plans to overhaul the Resource Management Act - due to his opposition, and that of the Maori Party.

John Key says the reforms have been parked up because the government wasn't guaranteed the numbers to pass a law change.

The United Future leader says he had no issue with streamlining RMA processes or speeding up consents - but was worried about undermining environmental protections.

He says the environment's currently the benchmark against which RMA decisions are made - and National's attempt to change that and make it just one of several factors to consider was unacceptable.

Mr Dunne says National was trying to "gut" the original law - and its claims of consenting delays, because the law couldn't pass, is "a red herring".
