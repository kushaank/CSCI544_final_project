
An Islamic cleric deported from London, Abu Hamza al-Masri, has been convicted of terrorism charges in New York.

Abu Hamza al-Masri.

A jury of eight men and four women found him guilty on all 11 charges.

Prosecutors said Hamza, 56, assisted the kidnappers of 16 tourists in Yemen in 1998 and attempted to build a terrorist training camp in Oregon.

Hamza, who denied supporting terrorism, could face life in prison.

One of the witnesses in the trial was Marie Quin, a dual New Zealand-American citizen, who was one of the abducted tourists.

Hamza was convicted in Britain of inciting violence and spent eight years in prison before being extradited in 2012 to the United States, where he was indicted in 2004 under his birth name of Mustafa Kamel Mustafa.
