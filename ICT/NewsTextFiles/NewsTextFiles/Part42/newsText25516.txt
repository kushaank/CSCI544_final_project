Former Princeton president William Bowen had strong words for select graduating students at Haverford College.

Some students and faculty members of the private liberal arts college in Pennsylvania had protested proposed commencement speaker Robert Joseph Birgeneau. Protesters were taking aim at Birgeneau due to his position as Chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley during the 2011 Occupy Cal incidents .

During those 2011 student protests, police used force to break through a line of students who were holding hands. Police in riot gear pulled students hair and jabbed them with batons in order to remove protesters using tents. The university had stated earlier that the students could protest, but not set up encampments. In a statement by UC Berkeley Public Affairs, the university stated that holding hands to block passage is not non-violent.

Whether Bowen agreed with the double-negative implication that holding hands is a violent form of protest or not, his opinion of how the Haverford protesters handled their distaste for Birgeneau was clear.

The Haverford protesters wrote Birgeneau a letter demanding a public apology and concerning the events that took place, something stating “ what you learned from them. ” Birgeneau was scheduled to receive an honorary degree at the commencement. To protesters, this would have been turning a blind eye to what they believed was his incorrect handling of the 2011 Occupy Cal incidents.

The former Princeton president didn’t leave Birgeneau off the hook either, telling the crowd that despite the protesters’ arrogance, Birgeneau should have kept his promise to attend.

William Bowen received a standing ovation from the crowd.
