
Taxpayers may have to fork out for those living near the proposed Basin Reserve flyover to move out of their homes for a while if construction gets too noisy.

The issue of just how much louder life could be with a two-lane highway flyover 20 metres north of the Basin was debated at the $90 million project's board of inquiry hearing yesterday.

Experts agreed there would be only a slight increase of between 1 and 3 decibels once 20,000 vehicles per day had shifted from the Basin roundabout to the flyover.

But they were less certain about how best to manage the construction noise that will affect homes, commercial buildings, churches and schools within 30 metres to varying degrees.

Noise expert Vincent Dravitzki, appearing for the New Zealand Transport Agency, said it had proposed a plan that involved capping construction noise at 5dB above existing levels.

If a job was expected to exceed that level, then the construction team would need to liaise with the community to sort out an appropriate time.

Grandstand Apartments on Kent Tce - the closest residential building to the flyover - would bear the brunt of construction noise.

The apartments' noise expert, Nevil Hegley, suggested the agency pay for double glazing to combat this, but Dravitzki said that was not the answer.

"While double glazing is likely to reduce noise by a further 10dB, this is likely to be insufficient and disturbance could still occur," he said.

"Other forms of management, such as temporary relocation, would still be needed."

Hegley criticised the agency for basing its noise plans on a series of 15-minute-long readings from Grandstand Apartments rather than measuring noise there over a 24-hour period.

"I understand you'll get some correlation between those figures, but I'm not looking for correlation, I'm looking for certainty."

He suggested the agency go back for more data before the ink was dry on its noise management plan.
