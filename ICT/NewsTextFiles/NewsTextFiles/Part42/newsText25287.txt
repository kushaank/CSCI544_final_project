
An Ado-Ekiti Customary Court, on Monday dissolved  the marriage between Mr Oladapo Afolayan and his wife Adejoke for constantly threatening his life.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the husband also accused his former wife of being adamant to correction, adultery and theft.

Oladapo, 39, had told the court that his wife was after his life and job, alleging that she seized all his documents and attempted to stab him with a knife.

He claimed that his wife was a stubborn woman and never heeded to advice, despite her mother’s intervention in their quarrels.

According to him, his wife had on a certain night, received a call from a man.

Oladapo said that on another occasion, he met his children at home alone and that they told him their mother had travelled with another man without his prior knowledge.

However, the respondent, Adejoke, 34, denied the allegations levelled against her.

She said her husband usually threatened her with a pistol whenever they quarrelled.

She said that her husband had also failed to care for her and the children for a long time.

She explained that she had never been promiscuous and her husband had never caught her with another man.

The president of the court, Mr Joseph Ogunsemi, in his judgement observed that the 11-year-old marriage had broken down irretrievably and consequently dissolved it.

He ruled that the wife be awarded custody of the children, while the husband should be responsible for the payment of the children’s school fees at any level.

Ogunsemi ordered that the husband should pay the sum of N5,000 as monthly upkeep allowance, and another N5,000 as monthly medical allowance.
