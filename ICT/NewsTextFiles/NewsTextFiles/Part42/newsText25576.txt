
HUNDREDS of mourners gathered at the Central Oxford Mosque yesterday to say goodbye to a grandmother killed in a collision with a fire engine.

Sultana Begum, 79, died at the John Radcliffe Hospital on Friday evening following the accident in Cowley Road earlier that afternoon.

The grandmother, who lived in the street, was crossing the road when she was hurt in the crash with the engine, which was being driven to an emergency in Blackbird Leys.

At least 800 people attended the 11.30am funeral at the Manzil Way mosque, before her body was flown to Pakistan to be buried.

Neighbours paid tribute to the pensioner and told the Oxford Mail that Mrs Begum – the mother of taxi driver Tariq Mahmood – was often out visiting friends and family.

Oxfordshire County Council Fire and Rescue Service was answering an emer-gency call before the collision between Howard Street and Shelley Road.

The force said on Friday that the woman was in her 50s, but revealed on Saturday she was 79.

How sad to lose a gallant old lady in such a way.  Was the emergency so great to justify the  driving?  Responses of emergency vehicles must always be proportionate.  Sadly that comes into question now and one hopes lessons will be learned from this case and applied across the board.  How many people are killed by emergency vehicles?  And how many lives would be lost if they went a bit slower?  We need to know.
