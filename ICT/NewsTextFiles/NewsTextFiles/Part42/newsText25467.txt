Prime Minister John Key is hopeful a change of government in India will reignite talks on a free trade agreement with the world's second most populous nation.

Prime Minister-elect Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party have stormed to power in India's general election, with a strong mandate for economic reform.

Mr Key says Mr Modi has a record of being very pro-business.

"He's had an overwhelming mandate delivered to him, so you can see the Indian people want and expect to see high levels of economic growth and one of those things is trade," Mr Key told reporters on Monday.

"We're certainly going to be taking that up with the new Indian government at the most appropriate time."

Mr Key says he has sent a message of congratulations to Mr Modi.
