The issue of putting live animals on display as a symbol of diplomatic relations between countries is an outmoded practice in this day and age when animal rights and welfare are increasingly a matter of public debate and of growing importance. From our point of view, it is no longer possible for us to ignore the ethical wrong of keeping animals captive in our country’s zoos and aquariums.
