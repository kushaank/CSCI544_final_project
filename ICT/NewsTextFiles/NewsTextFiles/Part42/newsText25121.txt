
KOTA KINABALU: The parents of a three-year-old toddler who was abducted in a Hilux-Vigo vehicle left by his father at a petrol station in Kampung Air on May 9, were freed on police bail today.

The couple was detained on Tuesday to facilitate investigations into the kidnapping of Low Ming You.

However, Kota Kinabalu police chief ACP Jauteh Dikun said the police re-arrested the victim's father, Low Yee Shang, 31, in connection with a police report on a commercial crime in Klang, Selangor in 2008.

He said Low would be handed over to the Klang police to facilitate investigations into a cheating case under Section 420 of the Penal Code.

"We have launched a state-wide search for the toddler," he told Bernama when contacted here today.

In the incident about 6am, Ming You who was wearing a white T-shirt and shorts was said to have been fast asleep in the 4WD vehicle before he went missing, together with the vehicle.

The Hilux-Vigo was found abandoned at the Clock Tower, Bukit Bendera about 9.30am on May 9.
