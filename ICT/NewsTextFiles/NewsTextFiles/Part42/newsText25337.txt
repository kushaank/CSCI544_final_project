CWI researchers have developed new models that incorporate this user impatience. As a result they are better equipped to deal with aborted data transfers and can help to improve the quality of service for all users. Researcher Maria Remerova will defend her thesis ‘Fluid Limit Approximations of Stochastic Networks’ on this topic on Tuesday 20 May at the VU University Amsterdam.

Developing and improving these results requires deep mathematical understanding of complex networks, and is the subject of continuous research in mathematics. This research was funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO).
