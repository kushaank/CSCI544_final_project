
A federal high court sitting in Abuja has ordered that Chief Obasi Lawson led executive should stop parading themselves as the chairman and executives of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association, IPMAN.

Reacting to the judgement, the legal adviser to Chief Obasi Lawson-led executives of IPMAN, Mr Reuben Wanogho, warned of an imminent judicial anarchy, following what he described as conflicting court orders, on the on-going leadership crisis that is rocking the association.

Wanogho, who was addressing newsmen in Abuja after the judgement, described the latest court order as capable of ridiculing the judiciary.

The Lawson-led IPMAN Counsel said that it was only an Appellate Court that could give such a restraining order and not a federal high court that has the same jurisdiction that declared Lawson as the National President of IPMAN.

Wanogho, while speaking further on the legal implication of the order, said: “Well, you see in looking at the issue we must be careful. One : it is subjudice and two they have the constitutional right to go to court. Nobody can stop them. It is their right. However, in exercising that right you must also advise yourself of the possible incidence of judicial anarchy, which the court at all times want to prevent.

“Judicial anarchy in the sense that you create, by your action a scenario in which two courts of coordinate jurisdiction may make different order or conflicting decision in respect of the same issue between the same parties. Such an action exposes the aura and image of the courts to public ridicule”.

He also stated that it would be wrong for anybody to ascribe to national leadership to IPMAN,‎‎ and condemned the attack on the National secretariat of IPMAN and called on the Nigeria Police Force to carry out investigation on the attack.
