
BEIJING: Two  Chinese contractors were abducted by  activists at a  copper mine in Myanmar and later released. The activists later sent a message demanding stoppage of the Latpadaungtaung mining project of the Chinese firm Wanbao.

The activists abducted three contractors including a local citizen while they were measuring land at the project site in Monywa in northwest Myanmar's Sagaing region on Sunday, said Cao Desheng, a spokesman for Myanmar Wanbao, a unit of Chinese weapons manufacturer China North Industries Corp.

They later released the local contractor the same day and the two Chinese contractors were released on Monday. The police arrested one of the activists Aung Soe as he was trying to take down the fencing around project site.

The abductors who claim to represent an organization called 'Student Network of Mandalay' initially demanded his release but later changed the demand asking for stoppage of the project.

The project site which is about 100 km from Mandalay saw a major clash in November 2012 when police tried to clear away protestors. The clashes resulted in injuries to 100 people including 67 monks.
