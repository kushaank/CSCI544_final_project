
The United States-exclusive private beta test for PlayStation Now, an upcoming game streaming service from Sony, will extend to PlayStation 4 consoles tomorrow.

The program has been in testing on PlayStation 3 since January, and testers have logged over 50,000 hours of gameplay so far. On May 20 (in American timezones), testing will be expanded to PlayStation 4 consoles, and the pool of testers for PS3 will be widened in the "near future."

At this stage, PlayStation Now's beta is only open to residents of mainland United States, but Peter Jamshadi, director of marketing for the service said in a comment  on PlayStation Blog that they are "listening to feedback however and are exploring other territories."

PlayStation Now was announced  in January at CES, and a full roll out is planned for the United States this year. Unfortunately, no details on a New Zealand release have been announced as yet.
