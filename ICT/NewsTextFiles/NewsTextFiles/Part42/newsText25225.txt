
 From Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) has vowed to continue its systematic attacks on the nation’s oil industry.

In a statement issued via e-mail by its spokeperson, Jomo Gbomo, in which it    claimed  responsibility for the  recent fire incident  at the NNPC pipeline jetties at Okirika, Rivers state, MEND said the attack was carried out to protest the inaction of President Goodluck Jonathan over the Niger Delta Amnesty programme.

Gbomo while claiming that the facility was infiltrated by some of its fighters, dismissed the official position that the damage was caused by vandals and oil thieves.

The statement read in part: The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) takes responsibility for the sabotage on Sunday, 18 May, 2014 , on the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Refinery Jetty pipelines in Okrika, Rivers State of Nigeria . This attack is line with our on-going operation ‘Hurricane Exodus’, which was intended to bring down the entire refining facility. “ This facility was infiltrated by a few of our fighters with the aid of our internal agents within the NNPC contrary to  speculations that the sabotage was carried out by ‘pipeline vandals and oil thieves’,   which is a very convenient phrase used in shielding the truth from the public.
