
Alliance for Peace (AfP) Nepal is a non-profit, non-governmental independent organization working for a peaceful and democratic Nepal. It is a pioneer organization working on political party reforms through democratization amongst the students and youth wings of the political parties in Nepal. Our thematic areas of work include human rights, peace building and conflict transformation with gender as a cross-cutting issue. In 2002, we were a group of like-minded students and youths meeting in a coffee shop talking about the spiralling violence in the country when the genesis of establishing an organization came into being. Today, AfP consists of dedicated professionals, student political leaders and concerned youth.
