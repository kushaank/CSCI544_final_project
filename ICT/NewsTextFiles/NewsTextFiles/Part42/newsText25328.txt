
A Filipina multimedia journalist has won the 2014  Persephone Miel Fellowship given by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.

Ana P. Santos was selected as the winner from a field of more than 220 applications from nearly 80 countries, according to an article on Pulitzer Center's website .

From starting out as a relationship columnist in a men’s magazine, Santos has moved on to become a journalist, reporting on such heavy topics as HIV/AIDS, gender issues, sexual violence and reproductive health rights for publications like IRIN News, Newsbreak, Rappler, and Marie Claire (Philippines).

Her coverages had brought her to Aceh in Indonesia, Thailand, Jordan, Israel, and Papua New Guinea.

“Living in one of the most disaster prone countries in the world, Ana has also begun writing about disaster preparedness and response and the many ways they are interconnected with reproductive health and population,” the Pulitzer Center article said of Santos.

The fellowship, which was launched in October 2010, supports an international journalist to report on a systemic global issue in his or her home country.

Launched in a collaboration between the Pulitzer Center and Internews, the fellowship also provides support from the Pulitzer Center for editorial oversight, multimedia development, outreach and assistance with placement in US news media outlets.
