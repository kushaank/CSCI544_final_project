
Former chairwoman of the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Tsai Ing-wen on Sunday called for a "premium" relationship between China and Taiwan, as opposed to what she called the existing quantitative strategy.

Tsai, who is running for the party's top post again later this month, said in a televised debate that maintaining stable and peaceful relations between Taiwan and China will be her most crucial responsibility.

She said she expects to build a more "democratized" and "transparent" cross-strait relationship, different to the current quantity-focused approach that is subject to political manipulation. The link between Taiwan and China should be a premium relationship, she said but did not elaborate further.

Kuo Tai-lin, a former deputy magistrate of Kaohsiung and the only other contestant for the DPP chairmanship, suggested in the debate that the party revise its charter to bar its chairman from running for public office. His suggestion was seen aimed at Tsai, who is widely expected to run for president again in 2016.

In response, Tsai said the DPP's leader will need to take on different responsibilities and play different roles at different stages, and that the party's members will decide who should carry its flag in the presidential election.

Tsai, 57, served as DPP chairwoman from 2008 to 2012 and is hoping to be elected again on May 25 to lead the party. She is heavily favored to win the election, especially since incumbent chairman Su Tseng-chang and former premier Frank Hsieh both withdrew from the race last month.
