
This has been stated by President Alexander Lukashenko at a meeting with Director General of the Organization Ahmet Üzümcü.

A few hours earlier, the distinguished guest met with Foreign Minister of Belarus Vladimir Makey. All the initiatives of Belarus are supported by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The parties also touched upon the situation in Syria. About 92 percent of the chemical weapons located in the country's territory are ready to be removed on ships provided by Denmark and Norway. Belarus has been directly involved in the disarmament process.

According to Ahmet Üzümcü, the mission on Syria's chemical disarmament has become quite a serious challenge. The process should be completed in June.
