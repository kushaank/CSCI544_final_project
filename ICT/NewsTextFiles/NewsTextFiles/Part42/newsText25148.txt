
KUALA LUMPUR — Malaysia Airlines has been described as “irresponsible” and “heartless” for abandoning families of the flight crew who had sought the help of a foreign law firm to safeguard their interests in the MH370 saga.

This latest salvo against the national carrier came from National Union of Flight Attendants (Nufam) president Ismail Nasaruddin who said Malaysia Airlines cannot cut itself off from the grieving families simply because they had sought legal advice.

“It is their obligation to care for the well-being of their employees and their families. Furthermore, (Malaysia Airlines) has not offered to make any payout to the families of the crew members,” Mr Ismail said.

He hit out at Malaysia Airlines for not keeping its promise which was given to the families when the flight which was bound for Beijing went missing on March 8.

“(Malaysia Airlines) had initially promised the families many things. However they have ignored all of these obligations towards the families in the last couple of weeks,” said Mr Ismail.

Yesterday (May 18), families of the crew on board the lost MH370 said Malaysia Airlines had “abandoned” them because they sought the help of a foreign law firm, including stopping the services of the caregivers who had been there for them to provide emotional support.

Ms Jacquita Gonzales, wife of in-flight supervisor Patrick Francis Gomes, in a press conference at Holiday Villa Hotel yesterday said the caregivers were the families’ lifeline.

The families of seven of the 12 crew members said the national carrier sent an email to them two days ago asking them to get their lawyers to deal with the airlines legal team for all requests related to the missing passenger jet.

Ms Jacquita said this happened after the airlines got wind that the families of the seven had hired a legal advisor.
