
Apple and Samsung combined for 71% of the 41.3 million branded tablets in the first calendar quarter of 2014, according to early vendor shipment share estimates from market intelligence firm ABI Research. This is the closest the two leading vendors have come to date and the pair remains well-ahead the rest of the pack.

The mix of tablet operating systems is also showing signs of stability with only minor changes in shipment share. Android continues to lead new tablet shipments at 56.3% for 1Q 2014 followed by iOS at 39.6% and Windows 8/RT at 4.1% with an accuracy of +/- 3% due to vendors yet to report.

A bright spot in the quarter was the tablet attach rate level of mobile broadband modems (3G and 4G). A little over 1-in-5 tablets, or 22%, shipped with an embedded modem, which is the highest penetration seen since the September quarter of 2011. “As major advanced markets become saturated, buyers are expanding their tablet use case, which is also pushing up the ASP in these markets,” adds Orr.
