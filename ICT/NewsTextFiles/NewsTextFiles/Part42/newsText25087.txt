
KUCHING: SUPP president Tan Sri Peter Chin has advised Dato Sri Wong Soon Koh to stop harping on the so-called 50/50 Formula that was supposed to resolve the party’s leadership crisis.

Chin reckoned that Wong blamed him and his team for ‘rejecting’ the formula as he (Wong) needed someone to take the blame for the current political situation.

He said since Wong had decided to join Parti Tenaga Rakyat Sarawak (Teras), the latter should stop finding a scapegoat for the decision made.

“Wong recently mentioned there was a formula of 50 per cent for him and 50 per cent for me to settle the issue, but I have been keeping quiet on this matter.

“If he has decided to join Teras, good luck to him, but do not find a scapegoat,” he told reporters at the party’s headquarters here yesterday.

Chin explained he keep mum in public because he believed the truth would ultimately prevail.

“I have not been saying anything because I know what he (Wong) is saying is not the truth. There was no such thing being discussed or agreement being made,” said Chin.

Chin said as far as he was concerned, the ROS left SUPP off the hook not because of any agreement.
