
Government ministers are keeping their distance from the Ruataniwha Dam proposal - as Ngai Tahu's pullout leaves the Hawke's Bay irrigation project in doubt.

It comes less than two months after Trustpower pulled out of funding the scheme.

Environment Minister Amy Adams wouldn't be drawn on where the project now stands.

"My role is just limited to appointing the board of inquiry and they've made an extension to extend the time, which I've granted."

Conservation Minister Nick Smith is also reluctant to discuss it.

"It's an individual decision for investors as if they want to be part of it. There's a lot of water to go under the bridge yet."
