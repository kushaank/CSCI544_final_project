ARMM Education Secretary Jamar Kulayan said 450 others will take oath on May 30 in Zamboanga City and will be assigned to schools in the island provinces of Sulu, Basilan and Tawi-Tawi.

All 1,353 newly-hired teachers have passed the Licensure Examination for Teachers (LET) and underwent screening process used by ARMM’s Department of Education (DepEd) in considering applicants for teaching post.

Kulayan said they opted to hold a mass oath taking ceremony to boost the morale of the teachers and solemnize their commitment to the profession.

The newly-hired teachers will join the 23,000 educators in ARMM.

Meanwhile, Mubarak Pandi, DepEd regional information officer, said there are still around 2,645 teaching posts for the region to be filled this 2014.

TACE, an innovation on screening process ensures competency and aptitude of new recruits. It involves set of paper examination, panel interview and teaching demo to rank qualified applicants as to hiring priorities.
