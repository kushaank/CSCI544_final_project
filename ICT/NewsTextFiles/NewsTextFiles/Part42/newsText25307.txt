
The 67th World Health Assembly is happening this week in Geneva, and one of the key issues on the agenda is noncommunicable diseases.

NCDs — cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease — result in more than 36 million deaths each year, and 80 percent of these occur in low- and middle-income countries. In Africa, deaths from NCDs are expected to outpace those stemming from infectious, maternal, prenatal and nutritious diseases by 2030.

The World Economic Forum estimates NCDs can cost the global economy more than $30 trillion — or 48 percent of the world’s gross domestic product in 2010 — in the next two decades.

But perhaps because the development community is more focused on addressing health issues covered by the Millennium Development Goals — HIV and AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and maternal and child health — funding to prevent the spread of NCDs has been minuscule. The latest available sectoral data on development assistance for health indicate NCDs received $377 million, or just 1.2 percent of health funding, in 2011. While this represented a 4.6 percent increase from 2010 allocations, it pales in comparison to what other subsectors are receiving. Development assistance for HIV and AIDS, for instance, is 20 times higher than that for NCDs.
