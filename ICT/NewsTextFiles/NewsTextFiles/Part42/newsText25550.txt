
President Uhuru Kenyatta last week unveiled a new-look county administration to be headed by the county commissioners, replacing the old system of the provincial administration that was abolished but the decision has been met with opposition and uproar.

The Opposition coalition CORD has dismissed the appointments warning that the county commissioners were in direct competition with governors who are chief executive officers of devolved units.

The coalition has warned thatits leaders would not recognise the county commissioners saying the law was violated regarding their empowerment.

But Nyachae tore into the political class accusing them of trying to frustrate the implementation of the Constitution saying they posed a threat to the full realisation of the Constitution.

"I do not fear anyone, that is why I speak the truth. On this one, the president was within the law and did not violate any provision, otherwise it was long overdue," Nyachae said.

He said the reorganisation of the provincial administration was important to ensure execution of national government functions. He lashed at those criticising the move as hypocritical.

Nyachae said President Uhuru Kenyatta was within the Constitution to appoint officers who would help him implement national functions as provided by the Constitution.

"I have seen people post on social media asking why I have not criticised the appointments, but really there is no reason to dismiss them. They are within the law," he added.

Information Cabinet Secretary Dr Fred Matiang'i supported Nyachae's stand calling on the political class to tone down the rhetoric that served to create an impression that their were rifts between the county and national governments.
