
KUALA LUMPUR: Taiwan's decision to allow more Malaysian graduates to work in the republic is good news to many whose degrees are not recognised in Malaysia, but it would mean further brain drain for the country.

Dong Zong (United Chinese School Committees Association) deputy president Chow Siew Hon pointed out that the opening up of the education field to retain or attract talent is a global trend.

The Americans had adopted this approach long before others, retaining foreign talent by providing employment opportunities to overseas students upon graduation.

He said similarly in the past, Singapore had absorbed countless independent Chinese school students from Malaysia.

Now, faced with a dwindling workforce, Taiwan has resorted to this brain-gain strategy apart from trying to retain its own talent, he said.

He pointed out that even China is opening up and attracting foreign talent.

On the contrary, he said, the Malaysian government failed to nurture and absorb the cream of the crop from all types of schools in the interest of the country's development and the people but stressed on the pursuance of a monolingual education system.

"The lack of a fair education opportunity has led to the outflow of many Malaysian students. Many remained abroad upon completing their education (as their degrees are not recognised by the Malaysian government)," Chow told China Press in response to Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou's disclosure last Friday that Taiwan is opening its career doors to more foreign graduates, many of whom are from Malaysia.

Chow said the majority of Malaysians who stayed on to work in their host countries upon graduation did so because the government had not been giving them a fair opportunity to develop their career back home.

"These Malaysians are residing overseas, but their hearts are still with their home country," he said.
