
QUETTA: An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) took up Nawab Akber Bugti murder case on Monday and called former president Pervez Musharraf in the next hearing on June 16, SAMAA reported.

ATC Judge, Tariq Anwar Kasi, heard the case in Quetta where former federal interior minister Aftab Ahmed Sherpao and former home minister Balochistan Mir Shoaib Nowsherwani appeared before the court.

Musharraf was represented by his counsel Zeeshan Cheema. The former military ruler’s guarantors in the case, Mumtaz and Nazir, were also present.

Aftab Ahmed Sherpao filed a plea seeking acquittal in the case, which the judge accepted and issued a notice to Balochistan government in this regard.

Musharraf’s counsel filed an application for his client’s exemption from appearance in today’s hearing. It was also accepted by the judge.

The judge later adjourned the case till June 16 and ordered Pervez Musharraf’s guarantors to ensure his appearance on the next hearing.

Musharraf has been banned from leaving Pakistan as the federal government has refused to remove his name from the Exit Control List (ECL).

The 70-year-old Musharraf was indicted in March on charges relating to his imposition of emergency rule in late 2007. The ex-general, who seized power in 1999 and resigned in 2008, has pleaded "not guilty" to the treason charges.
