
SOUTH BERWICK, MAINE — Roughly 100 friends, neighbors, and family members gathered at the Springhill Lodge in South Berwick Saturday evening to join the South Berwick-Elliot Rotary Club in honoring David Stansfield as the 2014 Citizen of the Year.

Stansfield has been a part of the South Berwick community his entire life and has been active in just about everything in town including SoBo Central, a non-profit organization that “nurtures the town's unique sense of place by connecting and engaging citizens in community life.” During the event, which included a buffet dinner Saturday evening, a slide show was on display with pictures of him and his family for the 60 plus years he has lived in South Berwick.

The Rotary Club has a “4-way test” that not only club members live by, but summarizes the criteria for potential citizens of the year; Is it true, it is fair to all concerned, will it build good will and better friendships, and will it be beneficial to all concerned. In the selection process, they look for people who are role models that do things just because it's the right thing to do, and that love seeing their community as a thriving place to be, according to DeColfmacker.

“His calendar is loaded; it's always about other people and other stuff with the town. I wish I could be as busy and involved as he is, it's awesome to see,” says Jon Stansfield, Stansfield's son.
