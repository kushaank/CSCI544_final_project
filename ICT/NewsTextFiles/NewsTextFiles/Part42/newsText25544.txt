
NEW YORK (AP) â€” An Occupy Wall Street activist convicted of assaulting a police officer could get as much as seven years in prison.

But the activist, Cecily McMillan, might also get probation.

Her attorney says she'll address the judge at her sentencing Monday.

The felony trial of McMillan, a 25-year-old graduate student, became a rallying point for activists. Dozens of her supporters are expected to be in the courtroom.

McMillan was charged with deliberately elbowing an officer in the eye during Occupy's six-month observance in March 2012.

While more than 2,600 cases ensued from the protests over economic inequality, most involved misdemeanor or violation charges.

Manhattan prosecutors agreed to dismiss more than 78 percent of some 2,644 Occupy-related cases. Most include the condition that defendants stay of trouble for six months.
