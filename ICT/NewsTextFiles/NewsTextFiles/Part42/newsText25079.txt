
Malawi’s presidential poll is likely to be a tight race between incument President Joyce Banda and three other candidates, a political analyst said Monday.Speaking on Capital Radio on Monday, Mustapha Hussein said the presidential election is likely to be a four-horse race and that whoever wins would do so with a narrow vote.

He said besides Banda of the People’s Party, other main candidates are Malawi Congress Party’s Lazarus Chakwera, Peter Mutharika of the Democratic Progressive Party and United Democratic Front’s Atupele Muluzi.

“As seen during the campaign period, the race is for the four big candidates. You cannot tell as who is leading because the patronage was the same,” he said.

Hussein, however, warned that it would be suicidal to completely right-off other presidential candidates as some parties may have gained some ground during the past few months.

The assessment comes on the back of two recent opinion surveys that tipped Banda and Mutharika as the most likely winners of the presidential poll.

There are 12 presidential hopefuls in the general elections during which Malawians are also expected to choose parliamentarians and local councillors.
