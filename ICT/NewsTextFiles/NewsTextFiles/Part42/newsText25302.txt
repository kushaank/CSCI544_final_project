
The humanitarian organization World Vision says more funds are needed to care for children who have been recently orphaned or who have been separated from their families during the conflict in South Sudan.

More than 3,300 of children have been registered as orphaned or separated from their parents since the conflict broke out in December 2013, according to UNICEF data, though the actual number may be far higher due to challenges in counting those who are displaced in insecure and remote areas.

“Customarily, extended family members bear responsibility for children who have permanently or temporarily lost their parents,” adds the report, explaining that conflict has eroded the ability of extended families to cope with the increased number of orphaned and separated children.

World Vision notes that these children need interim care arrangements until it can be determined what to do with them, as well as follow-up support to those who agree to take them in.

The organization recommended donors to increase funding for family tracing and reunification, including across borders in neighbouring countries, as well as scale up funding for interim care arrangements for children who have lost or been separated from their parents.
