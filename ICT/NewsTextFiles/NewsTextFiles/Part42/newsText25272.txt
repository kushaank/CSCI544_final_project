The Pentagon is adding a second drone to a  multinational mission to  locate and retrieve more than 200 Nigerian  schoolgirls kidnapped weeks  ago by Islamist group Boko Haram.

Recent days saw Pentagon officials fly an unmanned Global Hawk  surveillance drone, as well as a  manned MC-12 turboprop aircraft, over Nigeria to collect intelligence  for the mission. Defense officials said  Friday that they will pull the manned aircraft out of the sky next week  for  maintenance and replace it with another unarmed drone â€” either an   additional Global Hawk or, possibly, an MQ-1 Predator.

One Pentagon official, who spoke about the mission on condition of   anonymity, said that State Department, White House and defense officials   have been communicating in classified emails and working groups about   how to best provide assistance to Nigeria .

White House  spokesman Jay Carney said earlier this week that  additional U.S.  military advisers and FBI agents with expertise in safe  recovery and  negotiations were sent to Nigeria to assist with the  recovery  operation.
