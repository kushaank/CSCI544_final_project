
According to the book titled "Flight MH370: The Mysterybook", the missing Malaysian Airline plane was shot down during a joint Thai-US military training exercise. The book also claims that what followed was an "elaborate international cover-up".

The Malaysian Airlines MH370 was flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing but it went missing en route. The plane was carrying 239 passengers and crew on-board.

This book has created a lot of stir world over. The families and relatives of those on board are very angry with the author of this book.

This book has been penned down by the Anglo-American journalist and author Nigel Cawthorne.

"The drill was to involve mock warfare on land, in water and in the air, and would include live-fire exercises," Cawthorne said.

"Say a participant accidentally shot down Flight MH370. Such things do happen. No one wants another Lockerbie [Pan Am flight 103 by terrorists in 1988 allegedly in retaliation for a US Navy strike on an Iranian commercial jet six months earlier], so those involved would have every reason to keep quiet about it."

Cawthorne then suggests that "another black box" could have been dropped off the coast of Australia to divert the efforts of search teams. "After all, no wreckage has been found in the south Indian Ocean, which in itself is suspicious," he wrote.

We would like to point that Gizmodo India too had indicated a possibility of such an accurance in regards to the MH 370.
