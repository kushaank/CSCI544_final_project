
DIPAYAL: Doti is yet to be declared open defecation free zone due to lack of cooperation among various organisations working in the field of drinking water and sanitation in the district.

The organisations, including the government body, have been blaming each other for failure to proclaim the district an open defecation free zone as per their plan.

The District Drinking Water and Sanitation Cleanliness Coordination Committee had approved a proposal to declare the district ODF region three years ago, but only 23 out of the 50 VDCs in the district and a municipality have been declared ODF zones so far.  Prakash Rawal, the committeeâ€™s member secretary and engineer of far-western regional monitoring and supervision office in Dipayal, accused the organisations working in the field of drinking water and sanitation in the district for failing to cooperate.

Representatives of the organisations, however, said government offices should take initiative to build mutual cooperation.

Meanwhile, Lal Bahadur BK of Source Nepal argued that the drinking water office alone was responsible for delay in declaring the district an ODF area. Journalist Arun Bam said the monitoring and supervision committee had failed to conduct regular meetings and it was not even updated about the recent progress and data related to the declaration.

FINIDA, Asal Chhimeki, World Vision International, Newa, United Mission to Nepal,  and Source Nepal, among others, have been working in the field of drinking water and sanitation in Doti district.

Many VDCs in the district were declared ODF region in haste without proper infrastructural development and preparation, informed sources.
