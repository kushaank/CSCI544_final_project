Andrew Jones (Lieutenant) Wellington Salvation Army says this weekend's Red Shield appeal is being well supported by the business community.

''The official weekend for the appeal is May 24-25 which will include a neighbourhood door knock appeal and also a collection point at McDonalds Restaurant on Maughan St. We will also have a collection point at both Coles and Woolworths supermarkets during the week leading up to the appeal weekend from May 19-25 for people to make a donation.'' Lieutenant Jones said.The aim for this year's appeal is $80 million nationally from the support of the Australian community and businesses. ''This money is needed to be able to continue our work in helping people in times of need, when they are most vulnerable. The Salvation Army is about 'people finding freedom', freedom from addiction, poverty, homelessness and loneliness, fear and anxiety. But also freedom in finding who they are and what their purpose is in life.'' he said.
