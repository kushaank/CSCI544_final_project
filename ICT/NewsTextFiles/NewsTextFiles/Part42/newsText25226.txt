
Mr Babatunde Raji Fashola (SAN) Governor of Lagos State.

The state chapter of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, PFN, has recently called for a Christian to succeed the governor in 2015.

Fashola, while declaring open an inter-faith conference in Lagos, with the theme: ‘Peace, Religious Harmony and Good Governance: Issues and Challenges’, argued that the insecurity in the nation would reduce drastically if everyone embraced religious harmony.

According to him; “People have said that they want one particular governor and I have ask myself two questions – the people who said that they want one particular governor or said that there must be this particular governor, are they still conscious that it is an election where a choice has to be made? If there are two democrats, they should expect that citizens must have a say in who is sworn-in as the governor of their state.

“Secondly; I wonder when I heard those things. You can insist, but can you insist that you will be alive in the next one hour. I know that things can rub off badly, you may be on the wrong side of the government policy, but we must trust ourselves.

The flavor of the comments made above is one of the reason why Muslims stand accused of intolerance everywhere in the world, and why Christians in the South West will join all other progressives across the nation to re-elect GEJ.

GEJ is a poor performer, but is apparently the lesser of two evils if Christians have to choose between him and Muslims who always harbor radical Islamic sympathies. And same will apply to Lagos when PDP presents a Christian candidate.
