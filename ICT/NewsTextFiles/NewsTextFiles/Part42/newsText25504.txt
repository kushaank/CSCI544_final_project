
Known as the opposition party since a long time, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its associates proved itself after they won more than 272 seats and are on the way of making their government in the country. The joy of victory of the BJP is not just limited with the people who voted for them, some of the US companies are eagerly waiting for the pro-business government to make reforms that will favor them.

Gunjan Bagla, founder of Amritt Ventures, a California based consulting firm that advises clients on investing in India says that India had reverted the past five years with new regulatory and technical rules.

Bagla said that earlier he was skeptical about of such platforms but in this case he is certain about good business plan, as it is based on Modi’s 10-year track record in Gujarat. During his regime as the Chief Minister of Gujarat he had attracted many American investors, including Ford which strengthened the backbone of the state. He also said that India has huge infrastructure and energy that is required for pro-business climate in the country which could make it from being the 11th largest U.S. trading partner to among the top seven within the next five or six years.

Alyssa Ayres, a scholar in India at the Council on Foreign Relations, a Washington based company said that the BJP will create a platform that will create businesses as well as allow more foreign direct investment.
