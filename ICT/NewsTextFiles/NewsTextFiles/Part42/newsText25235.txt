
BENIN CITY - The minister in charge of the Lord’s Sanctuary Ministries Inc., Apostle (Dr.) E.S. Omomon has appealed to the federal government to do everything humanly possible to ensure the release of the over 200 chibok school girls abducted over a month ago by the Boko Haram insurgent.

Apostle (Dr.) Omomon made the appeal while speaking with The Nigerian OBSERVER, saying the girls are very young school children who know nothing yet about life. According to him, since the girls are very young, whatever the sect members have done to them will have psychological effect on them, including trauma that many of them may not like to go back to school.

The man of God said that what they have done to them is more than child abuse and those involved should not go unpunished, adding that God will surely deliver them (girls) from the hands of their captors.

“I strongly believe as a man of God, the end of Boko Haram has come, the name ‘Boko Haram’ will be forgotten in the streets of Nigeria in the next three months” he assured.

He wondered why Nigerian government should wait for the girls to be kidnapped or life to be destroyed before intervening, saying “ we must always find a way to abort their plans” however he believed that at the end of the day, the nation will learn more on intelligent gathering.
