
Five people, including a suspected suicide bomber, have been killed in a bomb explosion that rocked Kano on Sunday night, the Police have said.

The incident, which occurred at Gold Coast, Middle Road Junction, also destroyed vehicles that were passing when the suicide bomberâ€™s car exploded.

Eyewitness accounts say that the blast was so powerful that all that remains of the car is its engine.

The Kano State Police Commissioner Adelere Shinaba said that apart from the suicide bomber, three men and a girl of about 12 years of age also died.

He also said that the car exploded along the road, meaning the bomber could not reach his destination before the explosion.

The explosion, which occurred at about 9:30 pm, took residents of the city unawares, causing a stampede around the area which resulted in multiple accidents on roads close to the scene of the blast.

The area had been cordoned off by security operatives and movement is restricted.

Bars and alcohol-sellers in the Sabon Gari area have been targeted on numerous other occasions.

In January 2012, about 150 people died there in a series of coordinated attacks by the Boko Haram.
