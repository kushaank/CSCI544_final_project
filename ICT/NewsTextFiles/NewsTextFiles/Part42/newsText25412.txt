
KATHMANDU, MAY 19 - Prime Minister Sushil Koirala said that he has seen ray of hope for a lasting peace and political stability in the nation and that the nation will embark on the path to prosperity after the promulgation of new democratic constitution.

Addressing a programme organised to mark the second anniversary of the Ministry of Urban Development in the Capital on Monday, PM Koirala called on the political parties to work towards institutionalising the achievements made so far through democratic movements. He urged the parties to turn the dream of change into reality.

He noted that Nepal's development pace remained slow because the nation was caught up in the struggle for democracy for about 60 years.

He said it is not possible to achieve sustainable development in the absence of democracy, peace and stability. "Former King Mahendra murdered democracy saying that the development pace remained slow due to democratic process. Because of which 30 years of Panchyat-era was wasted," said PM Koirala.
