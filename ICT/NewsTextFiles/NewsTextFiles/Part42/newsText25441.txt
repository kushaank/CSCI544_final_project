
Police are looking for three men who picked up a Mexican hitchhiker in Hawke's Bay and robbed him at gunpoint.

They say the tourist was picked up in a ute about 2.30pm on Monday at the Napier-Taupo turnoff on State Highway 2.

The 30-year-old was then driven to the top of Mohaka Hill, where one of the men pulled out a gun and took his belongings. The men then drove off along the highway.

Police say the tourist was shaken but otherwise unharmed and believe those responsible live in the area.
