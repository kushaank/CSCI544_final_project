
The Sudanese authorities have been urged to respect the freedom of religion of a 27-year old woman who has been sentenced to death for apostasy and adultery.

On 11 May Sudan's Criminal Court convicted Meriam Ibrahim, nullified her marriage to a Christian man and gave her three days to declare her return to Islam.

Rupert Colville, spokesperson for the UN human rights office, said that following her refusal to renounce her Christian faith, Ms Ibrahim was sentenced to hang under the 1991 Criminal Act.

"We are deeply concerned about the physical and mental well-being of Ms. Ibrahim, who is in her eighth month of pregnancy; and also of her 20-month-old son, who is detained with her at the Omdurman's Women Prison near Khartoum, reportedly in harsh conditions. We urge the Sudanese Government to meet its obligations under international law to protect the right to freedom of religion, which is enshrined in Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which Sudan has ratified."

The UN human rights office said the 2005 Constitution of Sudan refers to the complete freedom to worship a religion of one's choosing and the rights of men and women to marry and build a family.
