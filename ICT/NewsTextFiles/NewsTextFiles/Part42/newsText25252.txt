
The Kano State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has rejected the outcome of the local government elections conducted in the state.

The party vowed to challenge the outcome of the elections in court.

The party’s position was made known by the former state Governor, Malam Ibrahim Shekarau, yesterday, saying that the party had no option than to challenge the results of the polls.

Shekarau said the elections were characterised by irregularities, adding that a report from the 44 local government areas of the state showed that there was no election.

He also alleged that there was wide spread deployment of political thugs by the All Progressives Congress (APC), who intimidated, harassed and unleashed reign of  terror on the PDP supporters.
