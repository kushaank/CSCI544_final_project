
On May 18, the former Prime Minister of Malaysia reportedly accused the United States Central Intelligence Agency of knowing where missing Malaysia flight 370 is located. He revealed his feelings in statements released to the public via his personal blog.

“Remotely by radio or satellite links by government agencies like the Central Intelligence Agency [CIA], if terrorists attempt to gain control of the flight deck,” the former Prime Minister wrote in a post entitled “What Goes Up Must Come Down” on his popular blog, Chedet .

“For some reason, the media will not print anything that involves Boeing or the CIA,” the Prime Minister explained.

Malaysia’s current Prime Minister, Najib Razak, said in an internationally televised press conference in April that the missing flight ended somewhere over the indian ocean. Later that month he told  CNN ‘s Richard Quest, in a TV interview on April 25, that he was not prepared to state that the victims of the plane’s disappearance are gone forever.

The plane went missing more than 50 days ago without a trace. There have been many attempts to find the downed aircraft but not even the smallest piece of debris has been turned up.

Eight countries, and countless man hours of searching off the western coast of Australia have only produced distraught and upset family members, left behind when the plane went down.
