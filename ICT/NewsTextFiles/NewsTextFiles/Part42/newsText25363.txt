
Rolls-Royce won a $31.9m contract to deliver deck machinery for four ocean going tugs, designed by Ulstein Design & Solutions, for Dutch company ALP Maritime Services. The vessels will be constructed in Japan by Niigata Shipbuilding & Repair. The vessels are being developed for towing large structures like oil rigs and floating production units over long distances. The bollard pull for each of the four vessels will be 300 tons and they will be equipped for anchor handling.

The deck machinery include a complete low pressure winch solution and a stern roller. The towing/anchor handling winches are specially developed in cooperation with the ship designer and owner. The supply of rudder and steering gear is also included in the Rolls-Royce scope.

The Ulstein design SX157 vessel will be delivered from Japan by Q1 2016.
