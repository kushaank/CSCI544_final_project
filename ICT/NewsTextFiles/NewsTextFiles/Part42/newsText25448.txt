
A woman found dead in west Auckland had a protection order in place against her husband, who is accused of killing her, according to a close friend.

The bodies of Farhat Rana Malik and her adult daughter Sidra Noor Malik were found with stab wounds at a house in Ranui on Monday.

Ishrat Malik, 55, appeared in on Tuesday charged with murdering his wife and daughter.

Roopa Suchdev said she knew Mrs Malik well, and the couple had been separated for about six months. She said a protection order was granted against him in January this year.

Mrs Suchdev said her friend sought help at Shakti women's refuge and was so pleased when she left Mr Malik six months ago.

"She was really very happy when she just separated and she been to Shakti women's support group. Then she came to me and she said, 'I'm like a free bird.'"

Mrs Suchdev said Malik recently wanted to remove the order, so she could move back in with her husband.

Police said on Tuesday they are unable to comment on any protection order.

In court Ishrat Malik groaned, clutching his head and stomach, as security staff helped him to stand in the dock. Bail was denied and he is to reappear in court on 4 June.

Pakistan Association founder Mohammad Tauqir Khan said the Malik family was very involved in the community.
