Former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad said the plane's disappearance on March 8 was 'most likely not an ordinary crash after fuel was exhausted. The plane is somewhere, maybe without MAS [Malaysia Airlines] markings,' he said. 'It is a waste of time and money to look for debris or oil slick or to listen for pings from the black box.'
