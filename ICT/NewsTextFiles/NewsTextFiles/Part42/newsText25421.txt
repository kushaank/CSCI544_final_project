
THE inaugural Fiji Performing Rights Association (FPRA) music awards will be held on July 26 at the Grand Pacific Hotel.

This was confirmed following the awards launch in Suva yesterday.

FPRA president Eremasi Tamanisau said the awards would be an exciting event for music in Fiji as the last music awards — the Vakalutuivoce Awards — was held in 1998.

"Despite the challenging economic climate, FPRA believes that this year marks the birth of a new dawn in our beloved country's political life and as such, deserves to be recognised with an open heart, celebrated with music, harmony and love, whilst performed by its best exponents," Mr Tamanisau said.

"Music creativity is something that our people are blessed and endowed with."

He said since the association's inception in 1992, they worked consistently to foster the development of music, protect the interest of composers, and open up economic benefits and returns in the fields of education, creative industries, communications, media, tourism, trade and commerce.

Mr Tamanisau said the objectives of the awards included encouraging creativity and originality in music, publicly acknowledge and reward outstanding works of music and boost copyright awareness in Fiji.

The awards will have 12 categories which include best composition, most popular song, best iTaukei, Hindi and English songs and best new artist.

There will also be a hall of fame where artists that have contributed in a significant way towards the development of music in Fiji will be inducted.
