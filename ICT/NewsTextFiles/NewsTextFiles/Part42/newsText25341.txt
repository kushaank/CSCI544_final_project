
Bayern Munich sporting director Matthias Sammer has voiced his admiration for Arjen Robben in the wake of the Dutchman's sublime performance in Saturday's 2-0 DFB-Pokal final victory after extra time over Borussia Dortmund .

The Netherlands international gifted Bayern the lead after 107 minutes to lead them on their way to their 17th German cup win, with Thomas Muller scoring in the dying seconds to seal the victory.

Sammer hailed Robben's attitude and believes that the former Chelsea man deserves all the praise that he has been getting in recent years.

"Arjen is a model professional, who also went through the lows with us in 2012," he told the club's official website.

"We can't praise him too highly."
