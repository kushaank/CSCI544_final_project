HELENA, Calif.--( BUSINESS WIRE )--As the official BBQ and grilling season kicks off, Sutter Home Family        Vineyards today announced that Michael Cohen from Los Angeles won        the $100,000 grand prize of this year’s Sutter Home Build a Better Burger® Recipe Contest with the Chipotle Bacon Maple Jam Burger, edging        out his returning finalist father Harold Cohen from Hollywood, Florida        who prepared crowd-pleasing Mexicali Burgers. This was the first year in        the double decade contest where a father and son competed against each        other. Michael’s Chipotle Bacon Maple Jam Burger was also named as the        $2,500 People’s Choice Award Beef Burger by cook-off attendees.

Michael Cohen, a composer, won the judges over with the flavorful spicy        burger topped with creamy blue cheese, bacon maple jam, pear, spinach,        and hazelnut salad during the cook-off at Sutter Home Winery in St.        Helena, Calif. on a beautiful wine country Saturday.
