Aucklanders are joining a global movement calling for the safe return of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped in Nigeria last month.

A protest march in support of the #BringBackOurGirls Campaign will take place up Queen Street in central Auckland at midday today to Aotea Square.

"My heart breaks not only for the girls, but for their mothers, brothers, aunties and uncles, sisters and grandparents," says protest organiser Auckland University student Lydia Hollister-Jones.

"We simply can't afford to sit idly by and wait for the rest of the world to respond. We have to stand up for the return of these precious girls."

Amnesty International New Zealand executive director Grant Bayldon will speak at the march, which he says is an important opportunity for Aucklanders to call on Nigerian authorities and supporting countries to do everything in their power to secure the safe release of the girls.

The 276 teenage girls were abducted from a school in Chibok in northeastern Borno by Boko Haram Islamists on April 14. More than 200 are still missing.

#BringBackOurGirls rallies have been held around the world and many people have called for the girls' release, including US First Lady Michelle Obama and former prime minister Helen Clark.
