“our enemies are not sleeping; but we will take the battle to the enemies where ever they are.. they have been tempting us; and pushing us;

Today is a great day, not only in our lives, but also In the history of the Niger delta, perhaps, this may be the greatest day in the Niger delta; this is because we are going to demonstrate to the world how and what we feel about oppression.

Our political office holders have not learned how to stand and fight; at all times, they shift ground to those who have sworn to make us play the last fiddle; those who have told us to our face that they were born to rule; while we were born to be ruled; I wish to restate that I was not born to be a drawer of water or hewer of wood; I was born to be equal to all others; no matter who they are; or where they come from.; how long shall we wait while strangers take their turns to exploit, exclude and marginalize us; with all the painful sacrifices we made”, he said.
