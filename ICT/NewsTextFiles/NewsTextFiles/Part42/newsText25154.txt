
SINGAPORE — Singapore-Malaysia relations are on a strong footing with projects like the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore rail link and Iskandar Malaysia, said President Tony Tan Keng Yam.

But President Tan said the two countries’ shared heritage is also crucial.

Dr Tan was speaking at a state banquet held in honour of Malaysia’s King Abdul Halim Mu’adzam Shah, who is in Singapore for a three-day visit.

Earlier today (May 19), Dr Tan formally welcomed the king at the Istana.

It is the first state visit by a Malaysian head of state since 2006.
