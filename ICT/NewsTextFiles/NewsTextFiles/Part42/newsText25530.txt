A local coalition kicked off a week of protests on Monday, calling on the University of Chicago to build a trauma center on the South Side.

The protesters say U of C should not get the honor of winning its bid to open a Barack Obama Presidential Library while neglecting the need for a trauma center.

Hospital officials say opening a trauma center would compromise the facility's ability to support other services including the burn unit and the neonatal care unit.

The trauma center coalition held a rally at 58th and South Maryland. They carried signs that read: "Obama cares, U of C doesn't."

Among the protesters was a mother whose son was shot near U of C but was taken 10 miles away to another trauma center, where he died.
