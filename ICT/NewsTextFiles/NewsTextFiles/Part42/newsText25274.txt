WASHINGTON--The U.S. has reached an agreement with Nigeria to share intelligence about the whereabouts of the more than 200 girls kidnapped by militant group Boko Haram in April, officials said on Monday.

The agreement represents another step forward in U.S.-Nigerian cooperation, and will enable the U.S. to provide intelligence imagery, including photographs of suspected locations where the girls could be held.

But the U.S. under the agreement will withhold much of the raw intelligence it collects, said Col. Steve Warren, the chief spokesman for the Defense Department.

The information will be provided to the Nigerian government by the interagency team working out of the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria.

A U.S. team consisting of more than two dozen military and federal officials also has been put into place in Nigeria to help in the search and investigation.

The U.S. is currently flying unmanned RQ-4 Global Hawks and manned MC-12 Liberty planes over Nigeria to help search for the girls.

On Monday, the State Department distanced itself from Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan's contention that Boko Haram is affiliated with al Qaeda.

Speaking to reporters in Paris, Mr. Jonathan characterized Boko Haram as "al Qaeda of West Africa."

But U.S. officials said on Monday that there is no direct connection between al Qaeda and Boko Haram.

"At this point, the United States does not see Boko Haram as an affiliate or an official arm of al Qaeda," State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said in Washington.

In designating Boko Haram as a terrorist organization last year, the Obama administration characterized the group as a "violent extremist organization with links to al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb," known as AQIM.

Still, it stopped short of describing the Nigerian militant group as an official affiliate of the global group founded by Osama bin Laden, while declaring that Boko Haram carries out terrorism.

"While al Qaeda has not recognized Boko Haram as a formal affiliate, the group's public rhetoric is very much in the global jihadist vein," said a U.S. counterterrorism official.
