
Boko Haram, the terrorist group in Nigeria, is prepared to start trading the kidnapped girls for prisoners.

Jonathan Brady/AP People are seen calling for the return of the schoolgirls during a march from the Nigerian High Commission to Downing Street in London on Saturday.

The terrorist group holding more than 200 Nigerian girls snatched from their school last month is prepared to start swapping the hostages for prisoners as soon as this week, according to a report.

The Islamic militant group, Boko Haram, has abandoned demands that its top commanders be freed, believing the government would never agree to such a prisoner release, The Telegraph of London reported Sunday.

But the government has agreed to release other prisoners and Boko Haram leaders said they will begin a “gradual” release of the schoolgirls, sources told the newspaper.

“An agreement was reached about two or three days ago in principle to start releasing some prisoners,” a source said.
