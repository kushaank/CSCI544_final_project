Blackstone Group LP has agreed to sell five Boston-area high-rise office towers to a venture led by Canadian real estate investor Oxford Properties Group for about $2.1 billion, according to multiple people familiar with the deal.

Blackstone purchased the properties in 2007 as part of its acquisition of Sam Zell's Equity Office Properties Trust, in one of the biggest leveraged buyouts ever. The firm resold many of the buildings just before the crash, but held on to large holdings in places like Boston and California.

But over the past 18 months, Blackstone has picked up sales of those properties, taking advantage of the high prices investors are willing to pay for well-located commercial properties. The Boston deal, which includes for 3.2 million square feet of office space, would mark Blackstone's largest U.S. office sale since the downturn.

Oxford would buy all of 100 High St. and 125 Summer St., the people said. Oxford intends to partner with the asset management arm of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. to buy three towers--60 State St., 225 Franklin St. and One Memorial Dr. in neighboring Cambridge.

In addition, Blackstone is selling its ownership stake of a sixth Boston building, a waterfront office and hotel property called Rowes Wharf, to its existing partner in the property, Morgan Stanley, people familiar with the deal said. The price couldn't be learned.

Urban office building prices in the first quarter were 11.3% above their 2007 peak levels, according to the Moody's/RCA commercial property price index. Foreign buyers and institutions are increasingly dominating the sales market because they're willing to accept lower returns and pay higher prices than traditional buyers like real estate investment trusts and local tycoons.

Oxford, the property investment arm of the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, has been a particularly active U.S. buyer in recent years. Other recent purchases include 450 Park Ave. in Manhattan, which it agreed to buy in February for $575 million, one of the highest prices ever paid for a New York property on a per-square-foot basis. In addition, it's co-developing with Related Cos. the more than $15 billion office and apartment project being built over a set of rail yards on Manhattan's West Side.

Other bidders on the Boston portfolio included the Government of Singapore and a joint venture of Norway's sovereign wealth fund and MetLife Inc., according to people familiar with the sale.

Blackstone continues to be an active buyer of property, such as its deal last week to purchase the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, a hotel and casino, for $1.7 billion.

But the firm also has been picking up the pace of some of its office properties as it seeks to return money to investors in older closed-end funds as values have gradually risen. Its $11 billion 2007-era real estate fund--which was used to buy the Boston buildings--is now valued at more than $22 billion, giving investors a net internal rate of return of 13%, the company reported in the first quarter.

Last year Blackstone sold $9 billion in office properties, up from $1.8 billion in 2012, according to data firm Real Capital Analytics LLC.

Blackstone has adopted a different strategy for selling office buildings than other property types. Last year, it sold hotel chains Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. and Extended Stay America Inc. through initial public offerings.

The firm is selling office properties individually or in small portfolios. That's partly because the value of a brand matters less in the office world than in the hotel world, and hotels benefit more from having a single national management business.

Asked on an October investor call about how Blackstone would sell properties, Blackstone President Hamilton James said it depends.

"If it's a hotel chain, it's going to be a business," he said. "If it's a collection of offices, it probably is more apt to be either individual properties or properties lumped regionally or locally, or by type."

Other bidders on the Boston portfolio included the Government of Singapore and a joint venture of Norway's sovereign-wealth fund and MetLife Inc., according to people familiar with the sale. The buildings include some of the most prestigious addresses in Boston's downtown, home to finance companies and law firms including WilmerHale.

Blackstone continues to be an active buyer of property, such as its deal last week to purchase the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, a hotel and casino, for $1.7 billion. After the deal, the firm will still have about 3 million square feet of office space in the Boston area, including the large tower 100 Summer St.
