
Gessler in 2012 launched the countryâ€™s first all-online secured lien-filing system, a project that began before the Republican took office in 2011.

Through it, businesses and individuals could more easily submit these liens, which are filed when financial institutions take an interest against collateral to fund a loan, and lenders could use a database to find out if other liens have been filed on loan collateral.

Now, Gesslerâ€™s office has contracted with Foster Moore International Ltd. to market and license the software for use by other states. The agreement calls for the New Zealand-based company to pay the secretary of stateâ€™s office $500,000 immediately, plus $100,000 a year for the next five years.

â€œWe worked aggressively to put more services online to increase convenience for our customers and lower their costs,â€� Gessler said.

â€œNow weâ€™re taking the next innovative step by licensing the use of the software to bring in revenue for our office. This added revenue will help ensure we can keep our fees among the lowest in the nation while delivering top-notch customer service," he added.
