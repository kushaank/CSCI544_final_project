
GEORGE TOWN: DAP secretary-general Lim Guan Eng has dismissed a Mingguan Malaysia newspaper report which claimed that he and party advisor Lim Kit Siang had planned the circulation of photographs of a woman in a bikini who looks like the DAP candidate for the Teluk Intan parliamentary by-election, Dyana Sofya Mohd Daud.

He described the report as defamatory, rude and below standard.

“Everyone knows that the bikini-clad woman in the photograph is not Dyana Sofya but a Filipina actress. Now, since this blog supports the Barisan Nasional (BN), they say it was all planned by the DAP, particularly Lim Kit Siang and I.

“This is completely malicious. If you are defamed once is bad enough, now it is to be double defamation. It is a malicious act. Do not embarrass a woman just because you think a woman can be easily victimised,” he told reporters here yesterday.

Mingguan Malaysia had published an article titled ‘Dyana Sofya dan Dakyah RBA’ (Dyana Sofya and the RBA Propaganda) written by columnist Shen Yee Aun which claimed that Guan Eng and Kit Siang, using the Red Bean Army (RBA) machinery, had planned the circulation to BN supporters of a photograph of Filipina actress Pauleen Luna who looks like Dyana Sofya.

Meanwhile, Guan Eng said all parties should look at the choice of Dyana Sofya as the DAP candidate as a positive thing and not criticise her capabilities.

“Maybe, you do not know yet who Dyana Sofya is. She is not easily cowed but will continue fighting to uphold justice and democratic principles for Malaysians,” he said.

The by-election is a straight fight between Dyana Sofya and Datuk Mah Siew Keong of the BN.
