
THE HAGUE:  Dutch police have found three-quarters of a ton of heroin stashed in a raisin-filled container from Iran, one of their biggest hauls, public prosecutors said Monday.

The container carrying 764 kilos of heroin valued at around 17 million euros ($23 million) was spotted by customs officials in the Rotterdam port a week ago, prosecutors said in a statement.

Police followed the container to the small village of Hagestein, around 60 kilometers east of Rotterdam, and swooped in on Thursday, arresting two men aged 69 and 33 "as they were unloading the cargo of raisins".

The unnamed 69-year-old appeared on drug smuggling charges in a  Rotterdam court Monday. He was remanded in custody for two weeks, prosecution spokesman Wim de Bruin told AFP.

The 33-year-old has been released pending an investigation.
