
Lagos – A cleric, Tony Rapu, has called on Nigerians to continue to pray fervently for the rescue of the over 200 school girl’s kidnapped on April 14 in Chibok, Borno.

Rapu, the senior pastor of the Lagos-based Church, God Bless Nigeria, led members of his congregation to a `Freedom Walk’ at the National Stadium in Lagos on Sunday.

“We need to pray and fast for them as their freedom goes beyond military approach.

“Let us watch and pray, because only God can rescue those children not through the barrel of the gun,’’ Rapu told members of his congregation during the walk.

Also speaking, the resident Pastor of God Bless Nigeria, Orhonor Orhonor, blamed the insurgency in the country on moral decadence.

“We need to go back to our homes, our churches and schools to teach moral values.

“Whenever we preach, we should not forget to preach love. `If I love you, I will not want to dispose you of your property; if I love you, I will treat you the same way.

So, let us learn to love one another, ‘’ he said.

The cleric expressed concern that the activities of the terrorist organisation, which had claimed responsibility for the April 14 kidnapping was dragging some states in the northern part of the country years backward.

Mr Moses Zakwa, the National President of Youth Association of Nigeria, Kibaku in Chibok, told reporters that the abduction of the school girls required urgent international intervention.
