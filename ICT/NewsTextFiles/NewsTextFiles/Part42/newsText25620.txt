
A court in Karachi on Monday dismissed a case of possession of illegal weapons against a US FBI agent.

Joel Cox was arrested on May 5 with bullets and three knives in the cityâ€™s Jinnah International Airport as he was checking in to board a flight to Islamabad. He was released on bail on May 8.

District judge Hasan Kalwar dismissed the police charges, a court official said.

The judge said the accused was not carrying a firearm and the anti-terrorism laws under which he was charged do not apply.
