
PESHAWAR/FAISALABAD: Workers of the Tehreek Tahuffuz-e-Pakistan (TTP) on Monday staged a protest demonstration against Geo TV for airing profane content on religious figures.

Demonstrators carrying banners and placards gathered outside the press club and shouted slogans against the private channel.

They accused Geo of running a malicious propaganda against patriotic national security institutions and ridiculing Holy Prophets family in their morning show.

The protestors demanded the channel be taken off air.

In Faisalabad, cable operators held a protest against Geo and Jang and appealed to PEMRA to revoke their license.

Demonstrators said that Geo hurt sentiments of millions of Muslims by running an offensive program.

We will block Geo across Pakistan if PEMRA doesnt cancel its license, he threatened.
