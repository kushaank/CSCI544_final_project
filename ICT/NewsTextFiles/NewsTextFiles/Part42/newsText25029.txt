
A federal court in Manhattan found Egyptian Islamic cleric Mustafa Kamel Mustafa guilty of providing support to terrorist organizations in Yemen and the United States.

Mustafa, referred to in court by his alias Abu Hamza al-Masri, was found guilty on all 11 counts of terrorism.

The cleric allegedly sent men to form an al-Qaida training camp in Oregon, sent one man to Afghanistan for training, and assisted kidnappers in Yemen by allowing them to use a satellite phone. Four European tourists died in 1998 during the rescue by the Yemeni military.

Mustafa was extradited from England in 2012. His passionate anti-Western sermons attracted Islamic extremists to his London mosque before and after the 9/11 attacks. Among those who reportedly attended his services were two 9/11 conspirators, although Mustafa denied meeting the men.
