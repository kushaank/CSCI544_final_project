
New Delhi: On Sunday, an army jawan was killed and two others were injured in an open firing by Pakistan troops at the border.

As per reports, "The incident took place around 10 am when the team of Indian soldiers went to rescue a colleague, who was injured while planting landmines on the Indian side at the Pallanwalla sector near the Line of Control."

According to source, when the team went to rescue the jawan, Pakistani troops opened fire and wounded three of them. One soldier later died during this incident.

There have been several infiltration bids this month by Pakistani militants along the LoC.

Last year, over 12 jawans were killed and 41 others injured in the highest number of ceasefire violation and firing by Pakistan troops on forward posts, civilian areas and patrolling parties along Indo-Pak border.

This will be the first ceasefire violation after the Narendra Modi-led Bhartiya Janata Party won the Lok Sabha polls 2014.

Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has expressed hope for good ties with the new government to be led by NaMo.
