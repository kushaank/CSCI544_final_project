
NEW YORK CITY — San Francisco may face obliteration by an angry sea-faring reptile in the new "Godzilla," but the creature would be no match for prepared New Yorkers, thanks to a new video prepared by the Red Cross.

Though the newest movie version, out May 16, stipulates an attack wreaking havoc on the Bay Area, New York has been home to a number of sci-fi movie monster attacks over the years — to say nothing of the naturally occurring disasters that have sprung up recently.

"How to Prepare for Godzilla" offers practical, straight-played advice from workers with the American Red Cross of the Greater New York region. In the video, they tell residents how they can ready themselves for the incursion of a gigantic, human-hating reptile or any other unimaginable disaster, should it occur.

Spoiler alert: The point of the video really has little to do with a big scaly monster attack, the city's disaster program manager eventually reveals.

"No one is really prepared for Godzilla. That is why Godzilla exists," says Uikki-Onosai O'Bryant. "But the ideal is that you work toward being ready for Godzilla."
