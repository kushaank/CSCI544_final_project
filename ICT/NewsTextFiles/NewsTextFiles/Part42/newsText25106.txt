
Former prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad (pic) has joined the chorus of criticism against DAP’s candidate in the Teluk Intan by-election – Dyana Sofya Mohd Daud.

Calling the party's decision to field a Malay candidate in Teluk Intan an act to deceive the Malays, Dr Mahathir said it was also window dressing.

"The action is mere window dressing and no high hopes (are placed on the candidate). If she wins, it's victory for them (DAP)," he was quoted as saying by Bernama in Malacca today.

He added that it was possible for Dyana to win as many Malays “were easily duped by such a move”.

Dyana, 27, is facing Gerakan president Datuk Mah Siew Keong, who is the Barisan Nasional candidate, at the by-election on May 31.

Dyana’s family members are staunch Umno supporters and Dr Mahathir said he was disappointed with her.

He said he would not have minded if she had come from a “pro-opposition family as from young, she would have been taught to hate Umno”.

"As parents, Umno members should tell their children about Umno, its history and what it has done (for country and people), otherwise when they grow up, they will do as they please," he was quoted as saying.

Other Umno leaders had labelled the UiTM graduate a “traitor” for joining DAP, with Wanita Umno head Datuk Seri Shahrizat Abdul Jalil reminding Dyana she was a UiTM graduate.  – May 19, 2014.
