
NEW YORK –  Chipotle is asking customers not to bring guns into its stores after it says gun rights advocates recently brought military-style assault rifles into one of its restaurants.

The Denver-based company notes that it has traditionally complied with local laws regarding open and concealed firearms.

But in a statement Monday, the company said that "the display of firearms in our restaurants has now created an environment that is potentially intimidating or uncomfortable for many of our customers."

A Chipotle spokesman didn't immediately respond when asked if it was an outright ban.

Last year, Starbucks told customers that guns were no longer welcome in its cafes after it had to close a store to avoid a demonstration by gun rights advocates. The Seattle-based coffee chain stopped short of a ban.
