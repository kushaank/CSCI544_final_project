
ISLAMABAD: Apparently moved into action by the enormous pressure from the political parties who have been demanding electoral reforms, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) is considering holding the local government elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with the help of biometric system as demanded by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).

The Finance Ministry, it has been learnt, has refused to accept the commission’s stance on the grounds that the ministry has already provided more than Rs 6.5 billion to the electoral body for last year’s general polls. For the LG polls, according to the official, the ECP sought Rs 6.8 billion, but the government released Rs 4.32 billion (including Rs 520 for Balochistan LG polls) and assured to release the remaining funds as and when required.

Also, the ECP on Monday decided to take action against those individuals who are found guilty of casting more than one vote in the May 2013 elections.
