
Fast-food chain Chipotle is asking its customers to leave their guns at home the next time they’re craving Tex-Mex. The new policy comes after participants in an “open carry” demonstration brought guns into one of Chipotle’s Texas stores.

Speaking for Chipotle in a statement to CNBC, its Communications Director Chris Arnold said military assault rifles were among the guns brought into a Dallas store over the weekend causing “anxiety and discomfort” to other customers.

The eatery is making an exception to the policy for authorized law enforcement personnel.

Chipotle says in the past it has simply complied with local laws regarding the open or concealed carry of firearms because it did not want to put its employees in the position of asking customers not to bring guns inside its stores.

Denver-based Chipotle now joins other companies – including Starbucks – who have policies asking customers not to bring guns inside stores. The Seattle-based java giant told patrons last year that guns were no longer welcome in its stores. Major chains that ban guns entirely include Costco, CVS Pharmacy, and Chuck E. Cheese’s.
