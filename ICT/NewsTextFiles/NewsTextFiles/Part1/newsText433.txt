JACKSONVILLE, FL- A Florida veteran battling his homeowner's association after they put a lien on his house, over a small American flag he is flying in one of his flower pots.  The stars and stripes are at the center of controversy. At least at Larry Murphree's home.  "I want it to go away. It's such a minor little thing and they keep coming after me," insists Murphree.  "They" is Murphree's Homeowner's Association. He's lived in the Sweetwater Community for years, and been at odds with the HOA for more than two, and it's all because of his flag.  The veteran decided to put one in his flower pot, and in result, has been fined!  "They just sent me a letter that says I owe them around $8,000 and they put a foreclosure lien on my house," he said.  We wanted to know how that's possible, so we took our questions to our legal and safety expert Dale Carson.  "There's an actual Florida statute that says he can display this flag," said legal and safety expert Dale Carson.  Federal law from 2005 also backs that up.  Attorney Michelle Haines works for the law office who represents the HOA, and said if payment is not made within 30 days, the law can move forward with the foreclosure on Murphree's home.  Last year, after a similar fight, he filed a lawsuit and settled out of court, but the flag display rules have been re-written since then. Murphree says he won't stop until he can freely fly his patriotic right.  "When I first moved here, I loved it. It was wonderful. But, it got where I'm being nitpicked more and more. I've lost a lot of friends and neighbors moving out. I don't want to move," explained Murphree.

In a packed courtroom, 52-year-old Ernie Tertelgte told the judge "I am a living man protected by natural law and I have the right to forage for food when I am hungry... You are trying to create a fictitious, fraudulent action."  Charged with fishing without a license and resisting the arrest for fishing without a license, Mr. Tertegte says he's being wrongly prosecuted for trying to feed himself.  Tertelgte, 52 years old, was arrested on Monday and is accused of fishing without a license and then resisting arrest.  He appeared before the judge via video from the Gallatin County Detention Center, and it was standing room only more than a dozen friends and family members filled the small courtroom. Tertelgte appeared subdued and respectful before the Justice of the Peace during Tuesday's court session, which went very differently than his court appearance earlier this month, where Tertelgte and Three ForksCity Judge Wanda Drusch got into a heated exchange.  Terteltge argued that the court did not have the authority to charge him, citing "natural law."  He told the judge, "You are trying to create a fictitious, fraudulent action." He continued, "I am the living man, protected by natural law."  He then yelled, "Do not tell me to shut up! I am the living, natural man, and my voice will be heard!"  Terteltge then pointed at the flag and said, "That is the Jolly Roger, that thing you call the American flag with the golf fringe around it is the Jolly Roger, and you are acting as one of its privateers!"  When the judge noted that he had pleaded not guilty, Terteltge countered, "I never plead, animals plead, sounds like baaaa, oink oink." The back and forth exchange continued for a few more moments, and the hearing ended after both the judge and the defendant walked out.  This time, extra law enforcement officers were in court Tuesday and the proceedings happened without any outbursts.  A friend of Tertelgte's told us that he and the others came to court to enforce the Constitution.  William Wolf said, "It's we the people that run this and rule this country, not we the courts, not we the government, and if the people don't start standing up for themselves and for each other, we are going to continue being subjects of this government."  Justice Adams set Tertelgte's bond at $500 and his next court hearing is scheduled for January.

A colonial-era law criminalizing homosexuality will remain in effect in India, a top court said Wednesday, dealing a blow to gay activists who have fought for years for the chance to live openly in India's deeply conservative society.  The Supreme Court voided a lower court's 2009 decision to strike down the law as unconstitutional, saying it was for lawmakers -- and not the courts -- to decide the matter.  After the ruling was issued, dozens of activists outside the court started crying and hugging each other in consolation.  "This is a very sad day for us, we are back to square one in our fight for the democratic rights of the gay community," said Ashok Row Kavi of the activist group Humsafar Trust.  Lawyers and supporters for gays, lesbians and transsexuals vowed to continue pressing for the removal of a law that they say encourages discrimination, even if it is rarely invoked by prosecutors.  "We feel very let down," said lawyer Anand Grover, who had argued the case on behalf of the advocacy group NAZ Foundation. "But our fight is not over and we will continue to fight for the constitutional right."  He said the foundation would ask for the Supreme Court's decision to be reviewed.  The law, dating back to the 1860s, when Britain ruled over South Asia, states that "whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal" can be punished by up to 10 years in prison.  The 2009 New Delhi High Court ruling, which said the law violated fundamental human rights, infuriated conservatives and religious groups who say homosexuality is unnatural and represents a threat to traditional Indian culture.  In a rare alliance, the groups -- including the All India Muslim Law Board, Christian church groups and Hindu spiritual leaders -- argued that gay sex is unnatural and that India should maintain the law.  Amod Kanth, head of the Prayas organization for children's welfare, one of India's largest nonprofits, cheered Wednesday's ruling and said banning homosexuality is key to ensuring children's normal development and protecting their rights to family.  "Only a man and a woman constitute a family and contribute for the holistic development of a child, which is not possible without a father and a mother," Kanth told Press Trust of India.  Activists have long argued that the law encourages discrimination and leaves gays, lesbians and bisexuals vulnerable to police harassment or demands for bribes. In a country where arranged marriage is still largely the norm, many gays hide their sexual orientation from friends and relatives.  Acceptance is slowly growing, though, particularly in big cities such as New Delhi and Mumbai. In the last few years, activists have staged large gay pride parades featuring rainbow-colored flags and banners, joyful songs and dancing through the streets.  The government, meanwhile, has begun acknowledging its transgender -- or hijra -- community, the origins of which go back millennia to a time when transsexuals, eunuchs and gays held a special place in society backed by Hindu myths of their power to grant fertility.  In 2009, the government allowed them to register to vote as "others," rather than as men or women. And in 2010, a new "third gender" category was added to the national census.  Law Minister Kapil Sibal said little about Wednesday's verdict beyond agreeing that the "legislature is the final arbiter of what law should be."  If the issue comes up in Parliament, he said, "we will take it up."
