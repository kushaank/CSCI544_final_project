
Johannesburg - Czech fugitive Radovan Krejcir and five others facing kidnapping and attempted murder charges are expected to return to the dock in the High Court in Johannesburg, sitting in Palm Ridge, on Monday.

Krejcir's co-accused are Desai Luphondo, warrant officers Samuel Modise Maropeng and George Nthoroane, Jan Lefu Mofokeng, and Siboniso Miya. All have pleaded not guilty to dealing in drugs, attempted murder, and kidnapping.

Msimango told the court that Krejcir poured boiling water over the head of Bheki Lukhele after he was kidnapped from his Katlehong home.

Lukhele's brother Doctor worked for a cargo company at OR Tambo International airport. He apparently disappeared with 25kg of crystal methamphetamine (tik) he was supposed to help transport to Australia, allegedly for Krejcir.

Lukhele was kidnapped and tortured to try and make him reveal his brother's whereabouts. He was allegedly bitten and kicked during the four days he was held at Krejcir's Money Point gold exchange business in Bedfordview, Johannesburg, in June last year.

Msimango said Krejcir suggested that Lukhele be murdered to catchÂ his brother when he attended the funeral, but then changed his mind.
