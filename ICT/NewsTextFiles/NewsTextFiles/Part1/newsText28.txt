
A federal grand jury in Pittsburgh indicted five Peoples Liberation Army officers for cyber-attacks on entities including Westinghouse Electric, Alcoa, Allegheny Technologies Incorporated, U.S. Steel, the United Steelworkers Union and SolarWorld.

The 31 charges filed against the Chinese hackers carry maximum prison terms ranging from 10 to 15 years, though it is highly unlikely any of them will ever stand trial.

The indictment alleges that these PLA officers maintained unauthorized access to victim computers to steal information from those entities that would be useful to their competitors in China, including state-owned enterprises, Holder said.

China reacted to the indictments with outrage.

In addition, Beijing announced the immediate suspension of the activities of the China-U.S. Cyber Working Group, established last year.
