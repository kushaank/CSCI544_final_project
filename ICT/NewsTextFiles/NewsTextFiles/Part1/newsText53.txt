
In a step towards getting the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization heritage tag for the Adil Shahi monuments in Bijapur, the district administration has decided to appoint a consultancy to prepare a plan to submit it to UNESCO.

Deputy Commissioner Ritvik Ranjan Pandey disclosed this to presspersons on the sidelines of a programme to mark International Museum Day, at the historical Gol Gumbaz here on Sunday.

He said a decision had been taken to appoint the same consultancy that prepared reports for monuments in Hampi and Mysore to get the UNESCO heritage tag.

“Though obtaining the UNESCO tag is a long-drawn-out process, the district administration will initiate the process towards it,” Mr. Pandey said.

He added that a signature campaign would be initiated to create awareness about getting the heritage tag.

It may be noted that the Advisory Committee on World Heritage Matters, during its meeting last year in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, had approved including monuments of Bijapur district in the list to be submitted to UNESCO for the heritage tag.

According to the officials of the Archaeological Survey of India, the district has around 80 ASI-protected monuments.

With the aim of creating awareness on the importance of the monuments and also to give the tourism sector in the district a boost, a weeklong programme will be held between May 18 and 24. It will include debates, painting competitions, and seminars.

Mr. Pandey said that tongas would be used to increase the attraction at the monuments. Visitors would be taken around the city’s 14 well-known monuments. He said tonga owners had been given special training.

Makbul Bagwan, MLA, Superintendent of Police Ramnivas Sepat, Chief Executive Officer of the Bijapur Zilla Panchayat K.B. Shivakumar and ASI officials were present.
