
Rome, May 19 - The Italian government is preparing to give greater powers to national anti-corruption chief Raffaele Cantone for his work related to Milan Expo 2015 in the face of graft and corruption investigations there.      But Premier Matteo Renzi has warned that Cantone, head of the National Anti-Corruption Authority (ANAC), "is not a superhero" and cannot be expected to resolve all criminal activity around the enormous event that will run for six months next year.           Renzi earlier this month appointed Cantone, a former anti-mafia prosecutor, to sniff out corruption at the Expo running from May through October 2015.      Prosecutors with Italy's State auditor, the Audit Court, said Thursday that they have opened their own probe into an alleged criminal network that organised bribes in exchange for contracts to work for Milan Expo.      Earlier this month, several people were arrested, including Expo 2015 procurement planning manager Angelo Paris, in relation to a criminal probe into alleged bid-rigging in tenders for Expo.      The arrests sparked alarm about possible criminal infiltration of Expo, which is expected to attract 29 million visitors and billions of euros in combined public and private investments.      Interior Minister Angelino Alfano said that the Cantone's office should be beefed up with more staff to fight corruption and to assist investigators who will pass on any findings to prosecutors for the normal judicial process.      The government has also been working on measures to toughen laws against white-collar crime including money-laundering and fraudulent accounting.      In Palermo on Monday, Senate Speaker Piero Grasso said that every effort must be made to ensure the mafia does not infiltrate Expo, while the government must also toughen laws and penalties against financial crimes.      Last week, Cantone blasted a related bill now wending its way through parliament as ineffective because he said it is worded is such a way as to tie the hands of prosecutors trying to nail those who commit accounting fraud and money-laundering.      "In this sector (of crime-fighting) more than in any other, repression and prevention must go hand in hand," said Cantone.      "Prevention means looking for symptoms, when the corruptor and the corrupted often exhibit no symptoms".
