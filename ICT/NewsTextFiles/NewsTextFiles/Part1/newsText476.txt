
German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel has vowed a much more cautious approach to licensing arms exports, unnerving the sizeable defence industry and signalling a change in policy from the previous coalition government under which sales rose. German arms exports have come under scrutiny in recent years because of the increasing sums involved and because a greater number of arms are heading to non-European Union or Nato partners, and potentially unstable regions.

"Exporting weapons is no way of making economic policy ... but this view appeared to change in the last years," Gabriel said in an interview with Bild am Sonntag newspaper on Sunday.

"If you make the wrong decision you very quickly find yourself doing business in death. I can't undo decisions of past years ... but I can say that for all decisions I'm responsible for Germany will show much more caution. Germany has to have restrictive controls over its arms exports."

In the first four months of this year, Germany authorised arms exports worth 1.2 billion euros ($1.6 billion), a slight fall on the previous year, according to the Economy Ministry.

The number of German arms exports for that period to non-EU or non-Nato countries rose by 130 million euros ($178 million) to 650 million euros.

Exports worth 97 million euros were sent to Brunei, 31 million euros to Saudi Arabia and 29 million euros to Algeria.

The Economy Ministry said most of the deals so far this year stemmed from Chancellor Angela Merkel's 2009-2013 coalition government with the Free Democrat Liberals (FDP).

The ministry is now run by the Social Democrats (SPD) who criticised arms sales whilst in opposition. They formed a coalition with Merkel's conservatives in late 2013. Earlier this month German media reported Gabriel wanted to block two deals to sell arms to Qatar and Saudi Arabia worth billions of euros.

Last year German exports of small arms and light weapons, defined as portable arms such as pistols, rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers and anti-aircraft guns, hit a record 135.1 million euros, a rise of 43 percent.
