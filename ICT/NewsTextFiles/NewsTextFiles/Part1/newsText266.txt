
Power supply today is  expected to be in surplus based on the outlook of the National Grid Corp. of  the Philippines.

The projection of the  country's grid operator is that  there will  be about 984 megawatt reserve for the  Luzon grid alone.

This, however, is lower than  the about 1,200 MW usual reserve of the country's largest island group.

The Central Negros Electric  Cooperative has requested the Department of Interior and Local Government to  include promptness of payment bills of  towns and cities in the criteria for the Seal of Good Local Governance.

CENECO general manager Sulpicio Lagarde  said yesterday that their records show  that the total current amount  collectible by the electric firm from the cities of Bacolod and Talisay and the  municipality of Murcia have reached P280  million.

He said  they find it difficult to improve their services because they lack funds and  LGUs have huge debts with them.

Tourist arrivals in Negros Occidental, including Bacolod City,  increased by 11.14 percent last year, compared to the influx of foreign and  local travelers in 2012, Christine Mansinares, Provincial Tourism Officer, said  yesterday.

Mansinares said that last year, there  were 1,126,583 tourists who visited the province, and only 1,013,622 in 2012.

Of the 1,126,583 tourists who arrived  in the province last year, 70,782 are foreigners, 6,991 are  Overseas Filipino Workers, and the rest  are domestic travelers, Mansinares also said.
