
STOCKHOLM — Saab could lose a Sf3.1bn ($3.5bn) order for Gripen fighter jets after Swiss voters rejected the deal in a referendum.

The stock fell as much as 7% in Stockholm after 53.4% of voters opposed the 22-plane contract, which Switzerland awarded two-and-a-half years ago.

A survey ahead of the vote showed that 51% of people opposed the transaction and 44% were in favour.

The result is "negative for Saab, but not exactly unexpected given the opinion polls," said Mats Liss, an analyst at Swedbank in Stockholm. While a Brazilian contract won last year is more important than the one from Switzerland, the rejection by Swiss voters means there will be "a period of uncertainty until the Brazil order is finalised," he said.

Gripen opponents had argued that the planes would cost Sf10bn over their lifetime, money that could be spent on education, transport or pensions.

The Swiss Defence Ministry, which initiated the purchase, has said it will honour the result of the vote. The Swiss rejection leaves Saab with orders for the next-generation Gripen E, whose development is contingent on an export order of at least 20 aircraft, from only Sweden and Brazil.

Saab’s shares fell 7%, the steepest intraday decline since July 19, and traded 5.3% lower at 179.1 kronor at 9.02am on Monday in the Swedish capital, with trading volume at 37% of the daily average in the past three months.

The result "is a clear victory for budgetary sanity," said Regula Rytz, a member of parliament from the Swiss canton of Bern for the Green Party.

"It doesn’t make sense that we have to save on the flood protection, that we have to save on the border security and at the same time buy new aircraft."

Gripen supporters had said neutral Switzerland needed them to defend its airspace.

However, this claim was undermined in February with the forced landing of an Ethiopian Airlines Enterprise plane in Geneva. The hijacked plane had to be escorted by French and Italian jets as the Swiss air force does not operate outside business hours.

Swiss Defence Minister Ueli Maurer told reporters in Bern on Sunday that the "result requires a thorough analysis."

Only after an in-depth study "can there be a decision on how to proceed," Mr Maurer said.

The Swedish Defence and Security Export Agency FXM, responsible for the Gripen negotiations with Switzerland, said what happens next is a question for the Swiss government.

Saab said it respects the process in Switzerland and that the result in the referendum means the Swiss procurement process stops. Its Gripen E programme would continue as planned.

"The Swedish development and production orders placed in 2013 continue, with delivery of Gripen E to Sweden commencing in 2018," Saab said. "The negotiations regarding 36 Gripen NG to Brazil are ongoing and according to plan with the ambition from both parties that an agreement should be signed in 2014."

According to the mechanical-and electrical-engineering trade group, Swissmem, the no-vote will deprive the Swiss economy of Sf2bn of orders. The compensation deals tied to the Gripen contract "would have secured jobs in Swiss companies," it said.

Under the contract, Swiss businesses would have received business from Saab, and over 500 contracts had already been arranged, the company said.
