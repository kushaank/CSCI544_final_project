
What: The Allegheny County Health Department and University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health will host a conference on climate change and its possible effects on public health. Free and open to the public.

Climate change in Pennsylvania could mean more than warming temperatures and intense storms.

Snow could disappear. Allergens could intensify. And Lyme disease could spread, according to experts scheduled to speak at a conference on Monday organized by the Allegheny County Health Department and the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health.

âTo be prepared for the future, you have to pay attention to the changing climate,â said Raymond Najjar, a professor of oceanography in the meteorology department at Penn State University, who will open the conference.

Najjar was one of the authors of the 2009 Pennsylvania Climate Impact Assessment. It determined the state's overall climate could warm by up to 7 degrees by the end of the century. Precipitation could increase by as much as 10 percent during the spring and 15 percent in winter, it said.

If the state does nothing to curb greenhouse emissions, summers in Pennsylvania could feel like summers in Georgia, with hotter and more humid conditions, Najjar said. Even if the state cuts emissions, Pennsylvania's summers are still on track to feel like those in Virginia.

In winter, snow could be rare, Najjar said.

Ninety-seven percent of climate scientists agree climate-warming trends in the past century are likely the result of human activities, according to the National Academy of Sciences, NASA and other scientific associations. Some, however, including the state's top environmental protection officials, have questioned whether climate change would have a major impact on the planet's inhabitants.

Chris Abruzzo, secretary of the Department of Environmental Protection said, âI've not read any scientific studies that would lead me to conclude there are adverse impacts to human beings, animals or plant life at this small level of climate change,â during his confirmation hearing in December. The Senate confirmed him 42-8.

Abruzzo also stated that understanding global warming and its potential impacts is key to developing public policy, his office said on Friday.

Dustin Brisson, an associate professor of biology at the University of Pennsylvania, will present research showing the spread of Lyme disease in the Hudson River Valley. In 2000, Albany County in New York had no reported cases, Brisson said. Now, hundreds of cases are reported each year.

In Allegheny County, reports of Lyme disease, caused by a bacteria transmitted to humans by ticks that can infect joints, the heart and the brain, increased last year, said Guillermo Cole, a health department spokesman. The department received 603 reported cases in 2013. In 2007, there were 32, Cole said, noting that numbers from past years were spotty, and there are now more stringent reporting requirements.

A warming climate could be bad news for allergy sufferers, said Dr. Leonard Bielory, an allergist with a practice in New Jersey and researcher at Rutgers University. Bielory, who will speak on Monday, said preliminary results from his research show the presence of pollen will increase 10 to 20 percent in the next 10 to 20 years, and ragweed will release pollen earlier and longer.
