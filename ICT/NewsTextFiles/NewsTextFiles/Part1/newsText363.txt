
Indonesia has shown support for programs offered by China, the host and chair of the APEC-Ministers Responsible for Trade (APEC-MRT) meeting, including the promotion of regional economic integration.

The two-day summit, which was held in Qingdao and concluded on Sunday, saw 21 trade ministers from participating countries pledging to improve trade and economic growth across the region.

Trade Minister Muhammad Lutfi, who led the Indonesian delegation, said China’s schema were in line with the work programs approved during the last major APEC summit, held in Bali in October, last year.

The meeting proposed three topics, namely promoting regional economic integration; promoting economic innovative development and reform; and facilitating the establishment of comprehensive infrastructure and connectivity among APEC members.

The meeting formulated, among others, a regional connectivity blueprint — which followed-up on the APEC Framework on Connectivity concept introduced by Indonesia last year, which aimed to improve trade and possibly drive down logistics costs.

According to Lutfi, the blueprint was intended to improve partnership between governments and the business sector to ease investment in regional transportation infrastructure.

“Building and developing a strong and efficient logistics system is crucial to maintaining the harmony of international trade,” he said in a statement released on Sunday.

 The statement described the three pillars of the connectivity framework, which emphasized the importance of developing physical connectivity (transportation and communication infrastructure), institutional connectivity (economic policy) and people-to-people connectivity (cooperation and interaction).

Meanwhile, China also named the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP), which was first raised in 2006, among its targeted deliverables this year.
