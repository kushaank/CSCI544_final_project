
A Duncanville teenager who survived a murder spree that left four others dead, including his mother and sister, is making huge strides in his recovery.

Storm Malone, 15, was seriously wounded last August when he was shot at his Dallas home.

Police say the suspect, former Mavs Maniac performer Erbie Bowser, killed his ex-girlfriend, his estranged wife and their daughters.

Malone is still homebound, but on Monday, he made a virtual return to school using a robot that can interact with his classmates and teachers.

Malone was so critically wounded that doctors thought he might not survive the first 72 hours.

Now, he's planning to physically return to school next year.
