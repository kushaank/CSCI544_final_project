
The Prime Minister admits information gathered by New Zealand spies may be being used to carry out drone strikes.

But John Key's confident the GCSB wasn't involved in the attack on al Qaeda in Yemen last year that killed New Zealander Daryl Jones.

He says New Zealand has in the past gathered information - including in Afghanistan - and passed it on to the International Security Assistance Force, coordinating those operations.

"What ISAF use that information for and how it's actually used I don't know, but I can't rule out that that isn't used for actions undertaken by the Americans."

Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has rejected a journalist's claim the GCSB likely helped spy on a New Zealander in Yemen who was killed by a drone strike last year.

Scahill has investigated such drone strikes, and says it's probable that New Zealand spies supplied information to their US counterparts ahead of the attack on al Qaeda, that killed Daryl Jones.

But John Key believes that's wrong.

"To the best of my knowledge he's incorrect about New Zealand supplying information in relation to the New Zealander that was killed in Yemen.

"I wasn't aware of and didn't have any involvement or prior knowledge of that particular strike."
