
Classmates and family members are rallying in support of a California teen whose portrait was reportedly axed from her private school's yearbook and graduation ceremony because she opted to wear a tuxedo .

"As we prepare to pass out yearbooks it is always regretful when a student portrait is omitted for any reason," a post on the school's official website read, according to CBS. "As a community we will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that all students are included in the future. We want to reassure our community that all graduating seniors are represented in the commencement program."

Nonetheless, classmates came to school May 16 wearing bow ties in solidarity with Urbina, who has yet to  comment about the case publicly, SFGate reported. Meanwhile, brother Michael Urbina , 21, is spearheading a social media campaign under the #JessicasTux hashtag in support of his younger sister, and says he hopes to meet with school officials over the yearbook issue.

"I support my girlfriend," she told reporters. "I support my school and want it to be the best it can for people like us."

According to NBC, Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory School Principal Gary Cannon said a photograph of Urbina does appear in the 2014 yearbook, though he provided no other details on how she appears.

Of course, it isn't the first time that a student's yearbook garb has sparked controversy in recent months. Last year, Jeydon Loredo, a transgender student at La Feria Independent High School near the Texas Gulf Coast, was told his portrait would not be included in the school yearbook because it violated "community standards."
