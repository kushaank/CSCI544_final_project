
Infamous, hook-handed Al Qaeda terrorist Abu Hamza al-Masri found guilty of conspiring to build training camp in Oregon.

Prosecutors at the court in New York said Hamza - who was tried as Mustafa Kamel Mustafa - assisted the kidnappers of 16 tourists in Yemen in 1998 and attempted to build a terrorist training camp in Oregon.

Hamza was convicted on eleven criminal counts, according to the Telegraph - and now faces the possibility of being sent to the "Supermax" maximum-security prison in Colorado, famous for housing other terrorists.

The jury, eight women and four men, gave the verdict just blocks away from the September 11, 2001 attacks.

Abu Hamza has gained a measure of infamy in the US and UK over the past decade, making headlines since first being detained in 2004.

Last year, it was revealed that French intelligence  had targeted Abu Hamza  for a potential hit, out of frustration with growing European indifference to Islamist terrorism.

The French intelligence agency also apparently planned to "take out" other senior British Islamists, according to the report.

On Monday, the jury convicted Hamza of helping to oversee a Yemeni hostage-taking crisis in 1998 that resulted in the deaths of three British tourists and an Australian.

The terrorist has consistently denied being involved in terrorism and had pleaded "not guilty" to all charges.

Abu Hamza’s defense team tried the dubious strategy of showing the terrorist as a man of "words, not deeds" and as an "independent thinker" living "on his own island."
