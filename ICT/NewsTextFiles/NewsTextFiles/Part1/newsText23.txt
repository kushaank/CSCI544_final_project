
Enmark Stations are in the process of holding two Full-Service Fridays to raise funds for Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. Full-Service Friday allows customers to pull into the Enmark Store, where members of the Enmark management team will pump gas for donations for the LLS’ Light the Night event.

The first full-service Friday took place May 9 at 14000 Abercorn Expressway across from Savannah Mall and will happen again from 4-6 p.m. May 23 at 3219 Skidaway Road.

Enmark Stations Inc. also is selling paper icons in all 59 of its retail stores in Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina in support of LLS. The paper icons, which can be personalized with the donor’s name, can be purchased for $1 and will be displayed on surfaces inside the Enmark stations. The paper icons will be sold through May 31.

The company has set a goal to raise $75,000, a $10,000 increase over the $65,000 they raised last year.

“The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society is an organization that is very dear to me,” said Houstoun Demere, VP/general manager of Enmark.

Savannah’s Light The Night Walk will take place on Friday, Oct. 17 in Forsyth Park.
