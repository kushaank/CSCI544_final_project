
George Clooney can't wait to make fiancé Amal Alamuddin his wife as he sets a wedding date just weeks after proposing to her, Showbiz Spy  has learned.

A close friend of Amal, 35, reportedly said that the civil rights lawyer is "poised to send out save the date cards" informing friends and family "to fly to Italy and then to Lebanon in September."

"September 12 is the date they are aiming for," said the insider.

 "Everyone thinks they will marry in Lake Como where George owns a beautiful home but Amal feels that is too public," the friend of the Lebanese born, British raised lawyer added. "They are looking to host a small wedding in an Italian village where they can control the photographers. But they haven't decided yet. They will then have big parties for her relatives in Lebanon and London."

Clooney, 53, reportedly couldn't wait to marry his fiancée but is said to be trying to keep his patience because he wants to give the love of his life her dream wedding.

"He'd marry her today if he could, but he wants to give her a dream wedding," an insider told Us Weekly.  "It is her first, and he wants it to be his last!" the source added.

The actor proposed to the brunette beauty with an impressive 7-carat ring he personally designed, after a romantic dinner -he also personally prepared - in his Los Angeles home, according to Page Six .
