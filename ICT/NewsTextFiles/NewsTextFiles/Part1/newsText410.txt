
BANGALORE: Over 300  ComedK medical seats surrendered last year are under the scanner, sources privy to an investigation into the  impersonation scam in  private institutions said. Sleuths of the central crime branch investigating the scam had on Saturday raided the office of ComedK and seized several documents. They are now collating information on those who surrendered their merit seats, and investigating whether there is a link between the seats and the scam.

It is alleged impersonators used to write the exam, block seats and later surrender them. The surrendered seats would then be transferred to the management quota, each fetching up to Rs 50 lakh.

Five more agents allegedly involved in the scam are in police custody.

Police sources said all the five arrested agents are from Bangalore. Thirty five impersonators and nine agents have been arrested since May 11 the day they were leaving the city by flight and train.

The ComedK Under-Graduate Entrance Test for admission to private professional colleges was held on May 11.

Auradkar said: From the investigation so far, it is clear that some college managements, too, are involved in the scam. However, our investigation is currently focused on the agents and fake students. It will be carried further.

Asked if it was a Rs 100-crore scam, Auradkar said it could be bigger than that. Asked why such a big investigation was not conducted when similar arrests were made last year, the commissioner said the CID was looking into it, but refused to elaborate.

Abhishek Goyal, deputy commissioner of police, crime, said many of the 300-odd seats that were returned during the last academic year could be part of the scam.
