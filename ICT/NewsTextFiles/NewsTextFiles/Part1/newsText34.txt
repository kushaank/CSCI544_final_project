
TELUK INTAN: There is an obvious swing of support from the Chinese community to Barisan Nasional in the Teluk Intan parliamentary seat by-election, said MCA president Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai (pic).

He said many people, including those from the business community had told him that only Barisan could bring development to the constituency.

Apart from that, Liow said the community had also started to realise that the DAP had betrayed them after last year’s general election.

The DAP, by not taking full responsibility of its Pakatan Rakyat ally, PAS, to go all out to push for PAS’ hudud in Parliament was proof of DAP's true colours, he said.

"This is the feedback I have been receiving from the people," Liow told reporters after a walkabout in the constituency on Monday.

More than 41% of the 60,000 voters in Teluk Intan are Chinese, while the Malay and Indian made up about 38% and 19% respectively.

Earlier in the morning Liow was present during the nomination of Gerakan president Datuk Mah Siew Keong to contest for the Teluk Intan seat.

He is in a straight fight with DAP's 27-year-old Dyana Sofya Mohd Daud who is also political secretary to DAP adviser Lim Kit Siang.

Mah, 53, was the Teluk Intan MP between 1999 and 2008.

He lost the seat to DAP in the 2008 and 2013 general elections.

DAP's Seah Leong Peng who beat Mah with a 7, 313 majority last year died of cancer on May 1.

Polling is set on May 31.
