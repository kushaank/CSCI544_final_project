
The Zambian government has finally approved and launched a digital migration policy in a bid to prepare for a 2015 deadline.

The country’s digital migration policy was tabled before cabinet last year for scrutiny and approval after the first one was rejected by private radio and television stations.

Private radio and television stations rejected the first policy because they claimed they were not consulted by the Zambian government. Broadcasters also said the policy only favoured government owned media houses.

This forced the Zambian government to draft another policy, but this time in consultation with private media houses. Subsequently, the second policy has been approved.

Confusion surrounding the project ultimately led to the cancellation of the tender.

As a result, the country failed to beat a 2013 regional deadline to complete its digital migration.

But Zambia’s minister of information and broadcasting service Dr Joseph Katema is upbeat the country will meet a 2015 deadline set by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU).

“I therefore direct the Zambia Information and Communication Technology Authority (ZICTA) and the Independent Broadcasting Authority to put in place standards and regulations to facilitate the smooth transition from analogue to digital and how best media houses could work together,” Katema said.

As part of the migration policy, Katema said the Zambian government is setting up two provincial television stations, which are expected to be operational next year at a cost of $4 million.
