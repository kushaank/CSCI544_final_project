
Over the weekend, Secretary Kerry similarly spoke at Yale University's graduation ceremony, where he even poked fun at popular culture's most controversial current event.

"You are ," Secretary Kerry told Yale's budding young minds , "the most diverse class in Yale history. Or, as it's called in the NBA, Donald Sterling's worst nightmare."

According to Boston College , the academic procession into Alumni Stadium will kick off at 9:15 a.m. and the entire ceremony is expected to come to an end no later than 2:00 p.m. The commencement for BC Law School will take place later in the week, on Friday May 24 at 10:30 a.m. in the nearby indoor arena, Conte Forum. Secretary Kerry will receive an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.

Kerry received a J.D. from Boston College Law School in 1976. Today he'll receive an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.

Also receiving honorary degrees from BC are Boston Celtics legend andÂ Â Hall-of-Famer Bob Cousy; alumna Ann Riley Finck, an award-winning leader in the nursing profession; alumna Paloma Izquierdo-Hernandez, president and CEO of Urban Health Plan Inc.; and alumnus and University Trustee Robert Morrissey, founder and senior partner of Boston law firm Morrissey, Hawkins & Lynch.

Last year, Boston College was honored to hostÂ Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny as the commencement speaker.

Monday won't be all pomp and circumstance, though. According toÂ Boston magazine , a protest is planned and will be held outside the ceremony. The Catholic Action League of Massachusetts is supposedly displeased with Secretary Kerry's stances on abortion, birth control and same-sex marriage. They're also calling on Cardinal Sean O'Malley to recuse himself from today's events, the second time in two years.

The groups is expected to "take place at the entrance to Alumni Stadium on Beacon Street, near where families and graduates will be walking around the campus for the dayâ€™s events."
