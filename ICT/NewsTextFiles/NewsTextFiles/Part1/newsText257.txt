
The new gantry crane, costing £6m, was installed at the end of 2013 and has enabled the port to accommodate larger container ships, attract new business and improve operational efficiency.

The Port of Tyne is the UK’s fastest growing major deep-sea port, providing a vital connection to Europe and beyond for trade and industry.

The Port’s CEO, Andrew Moffat, said: “We were pleased to be able to show the Prime Minister and Martin Callanan around the port and the view from the top of the gantry crane is spectacular, enabling our guests to see the scale and breadth of the port’s operations like no other vantage point.

“We have just had our busiest time for almost 50 years and handled record volumes of cargo and numbers of passengers.

The Prime Minister also met the Port’s 16 apprentices – from engineering to business administration – and took a walk along the main Riverside Quay.

The Port of Tyne reported record growth in 2013 and won the North East Business of the Year title. It is in the top 2% of Investors in People Silver companies and last year made an ongoing commitment to donate every year 1% of profit to its Community Action Fund.
