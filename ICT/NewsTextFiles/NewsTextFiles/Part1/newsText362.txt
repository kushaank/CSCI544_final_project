
Of the total 20,603 electors who opted for None of the Above (NOTA) in Salem Lok Sabha constituency, over 60 per cent were in urban areas.

Electors who opted for NOTA in six Assembly constituencies include: Omalur (2,228 votes), Edappadi (2,361), Salem West (3,846), Salem North (4,894), Salem South (4,657) and Veerapandi (2,591).

Of the total 1,098 postal votes, 24 opted for NOTA. Thus most of the electors were in urban areas coming under the Assembly constituencies of Salem (West, North and South) that comes under the Corporation limit.

The decision of urban voters opting for NOTA has surprised the political parties as NOTA has secured more votes than Aam Aadmi Party candidate E. Satheesh Kumar and 21 other candidates in the fray.

Though young voters did not turn up in large numbers for voting in urban areas, electors who had till now abstained from voting due to various reasons have probably used the opportunity to express their anger.

Also, though there are no specific issues for urban electors opting for NOTA, it is said that poor roads, sanitation, anger against political parties, non-allotment of the constituency to PMK, dissatisfaction about candidates in fray could also be the reason.

Tamil Nadu People Rights Movement State president Poomozhi told The Hindu that 4,431 electors opted for NOTA in the Yercaud By-election in December last year.

Now 20,603 electors opted for it. Electors have chance to vent their anger against political parties and government officials who fail in their duty. “This must be viewed seriously and efforts should be taken to fulfil needs of people,” he added.
