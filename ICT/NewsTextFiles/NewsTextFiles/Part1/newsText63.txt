
MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — A wide-ranging group of anti-hunger advocates praised the just-ended Minnesota Legislature Monday for making significant progress to help half a million hungry Minnesotans.

The Legislature approved a permanent increase in food shelf funding. It also voted to raise the minimum wage to $9.50 an hour by 2016.

And it expanded the free school lunch program after reports that some children were turned away.

“There’s going to be 61,000 children who are guaranteed a hot meal, and maybe more importantly, it’s going to mean for those children that they are going to be protected from having their trays pulled from them,” said Jessica Webster, of the Legal Services Advocacy Project.

Anti-hunger groups say they will ask next year’s Legislature to help more seniors and rural Minnesotans with mobile food shelves.
