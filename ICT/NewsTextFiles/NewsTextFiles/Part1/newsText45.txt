
People of all ages and abilities took to the water this weekend (17-18 May) to experience sailing and windsurfing with RYA Push the Boat Out.

“We are delighted to see so many clubs and centres taking part in the weekend, running fantastic events for their local communities. Thank you to everybody involved for all of the hard work”.

Mike Gibson, Commodore of Bartley Sailing Club in the Midlands said: “We took advantage of the opportunity to open our doors so anybody who wanted to try sailing of any age ability, could get out on the water and see if they enjoy it. It’s important to try and show that the sport is not elitist and that it’s open to everybody".
