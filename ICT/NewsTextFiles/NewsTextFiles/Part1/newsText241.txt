
NORRISTOWN � A West Pottsgrove man has been granted nominal bail but must wear an electronic monitoring device while awaiting trial on weapons offenses stemming from a standoff with police during a domestic-related incident at his home last year.

Todd P. Lewiski, 53, of the first block of West Race Street, won�t be released from the Montgomery County Correctional Facility until he can be fitted with a global positioning system device that will allow authorities to track his whereabouts. Assistant District Attorney Rebecca Strubel and defense lawyer Kathryn Taxis reached an agreement on the bail issue because Lewiski has not been brought to trial within the required 180 days since being in custody.

Under the law, defendants must be tried within 365 days of arrest. After 180 days, if they are incarcerated, they are entitled to nominal bail.

�As such he�s entitled to nominal bail. That being said, we reached an agreement that he would be monitored with GPS monitoring as opposed to completely free. So there are conditions of bail,� Strubel said.

�I think it�s an appropriate resolution,� Taxis added.

Judge Carolyn T. Carluccio approved the agreement, but also warned Lewiski, who had been in jail in lieu of $99,000 cash bail, that he is not to have any contact with a woman whose head he allegedly threatened to cut off with a machete during the domestic incident. The woman had been a guest in Lewiski�s home at the time of the alleged incident.

�I don�t ever want to see her again,� Lewiski adamantly uttered to the judge.

Lewiski is awaiting trial on numerous felony weapons offenses as well as charges of simple assault, terroristic threats and harassment in connection with the alleged May 30, 2013, incident. With the charges, authorities alleged Lewiski illegally possessed 11 firearms and nine knives, including a machete, when a previous felony conviction prohibited him from possessing weapons.

An investigation of Lewiski began about 12:40 p.m. when West Pottsgrove police responded to the West Race Street home for a report that Lewiski threatened to kill a female guest at his home after he had been drinking vodka and taking prescription pain medication, according to the criminal complaint.

�(The victim) stated Lewiski told her he was going to cut her head off with a machete, took a firearm from under the couch, slammed it on the coffee table and told her he was going to kill her and threatened to slice her wrists,� West Pottsgrove police officer Timothy Roeder wrote in the arrest affidavit.

A phone call was placed to Lewiski and police requested he come outside to speak to police. Lewiski did not comply with the police orders, court papers alleged. When the woman, who had been a guest at the home for about a month, told police that Lewiski had loaded guns in the home, officers called for backup from the Chester Montgomery Emergency Response Team and set up a perimeter around the house. The standoff closed a section of Race Street for more than an hour.

At one point during the negotiations, Lewiski exited the home and police were able to subdue him with a stun gun. Lewiski, police said, appeared to be under the influence of alcohol and drugs.

When West Pottsgrove police conducted a search of the home they found 11 guns, four of which were loaded, nine knives, including a machete, and ammunition, according to arrest documents. Police also found prescription bottles for Oxycodone and Codeine along with a small metal pipe that police said is commonly used for inhaling narcotics.
