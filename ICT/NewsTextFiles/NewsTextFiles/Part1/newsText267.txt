MANILA, Philippines – Low-cost carrier Tiger Airways Philippines wants to launch flights to South Korea, the number one source of tourists visiting the Philippines.

Tigerair PH, a unit of Gokongwei-led Cebu Pacific, filed an application with the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) for designation as official Philippine carrier to Korea.

In April 2012, South Korea and the Philippines signed an air services agreement allowing both countries to fly 28,500 passengers per week, up from the previous 19,000 passengers per week.

Cebu Pacific now owns Tigerair PH after acquiring the 40% stake of Tiger Airways Singapore Pte Ltd and the 60% interest owned by Filipino shareholders. The transactions were completed on March 22.

Cebu Pacific operates over 2,200 flights per week to 24 international and 33 Philippine cities. Tigerair PH operates about 118 flights per week to 11 domestic and international destinations from its Manila and Clark hubs.

By combining their resources, Cebu Pacific will be able to provide services to high-growth markets including Australia, Myanmar, and India, while Tigerair PH will be able to fly more passengers to additional cities in Cebu Pacific’s extensive network in the Philippines and North Asia.

Cebu Pacific is in the middle of a $4-billion refleeting program aimed at acquiring 49 brand new Airbus aircraft. It has a fleet of 51 aircraft composed of 10 A319, 30 Airbus A320, 3 Airbus A330, and 8 ATR-72 500 planes.
