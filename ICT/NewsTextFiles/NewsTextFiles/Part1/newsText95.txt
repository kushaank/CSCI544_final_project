KALAMAZOO, MI – Western Michigan University President John Dunn was the second-highest paid university president in Michigan during the 2013 fiscal year, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education's annual survey of executive compensation .

Dunn's total compensation package, which The Chronicle calculated at $776,062, placed him at No. 18 out of the 257 public university presidents ranked in the survey.

University of Michigan President Mary Sue Coleman was ranked No. 1 in Michigan, with a total compensation package worth $1.037 million. She was the only Michigan university president to be ranked in the Top 10. The top-compensated university president was Ohio State University's E. Gordon Gee, who received $6.058 million in 2013, according to the survey.

"Our analysis included all public doctoral universities in the United States and all state college and university systems or governing boards with at least three campuses and 50,000 total students in the 2011-12 academic year," the Chronicle explained. "This is a slightly expanded group of institutions than in prior years."

Michigan State University President Lou Anna Simon came in third in the state, with $672,000 in total compensation.

In last year's survey, Dunn was ranked fourth in the state and 88th nationally.

The 2013 fiscal year was not a typical year for Dunn, Cheryl Roland, executive director of university relations said.

The end of the 2012 fiscal year marked the end of his initial five-year contract with the university, she said, so his deferred compensation was paid out at the beginning of the next fiscal year.

His base salary was $369,195 during fiscal 2013, according to the Chronicle, and made up 48 percent of total compensation. Deferred compensation totaling $296,023 comprised the second-highest category. There also was $40,000 in retirement, WMU-owned housing calculated at a $32,000 rental value and a university-owned car worth $30,000.

"This is clearly not a typical compensation year," Roland said.

Next year, Dunn likely will return to around No. 88, where he was ranked the past two years, she said.

The Chronicle's analysis does not take into account the fact that Dunn has donated all raises above his 2007 base starting salary of $345,000, traditionally to the university's scholarship funds. This year, that amount will total $37,776.
