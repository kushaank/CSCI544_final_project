
Rebels in Syria made their presence felt as they gunned down Syrias head of air defence in a pitched battle near Damascus.

General Ishaq Hussein was reportedly wounded, as rebels attacked an air base in Miehla and succumbed to his injuries later. This is considered to be a big loss to the regime, and second in magnitude after the killing of intelligence chief and defence minister last year in a car bomb blast. It is not clear as to how the opposition fighters managed to engage the deceased general in a gunfight, and that too inside a well-fortified premise.

The fact that this attack and the casualties have come just days before the presidential election, due on June 3, will serve as a serious reminder to the authorities in Damascus to recast their security cards. Though Damascus is said to be completely under the regime’s control, the rebels have time and again managed to penetrate in it with deadly repercussions.

This attack has once again brought to fore the fundamental question of what’s next? Though on a winning streak with the help of Lebanese-Iranian backed Hezbollah militia, President Bashar Al Assad’s administration is ages away from addressing the imbroglio that led to civil uprising against him. The June 3 vote is all set to further compound the crisis, as political opposition cries foul over the Baath Party’s adamant attitude to go solo. What Syria needs is political pluralism, which should bring to an end the decades of unilateral governance by the Alawite clan! It is a fact that Syria has a serious demographic and representative problem, and the heterogeneous mosaic of the country is divisive on ethnic and sectarian lines. Only a national government can help it come out of that limbo and bring the civil war to an end.
