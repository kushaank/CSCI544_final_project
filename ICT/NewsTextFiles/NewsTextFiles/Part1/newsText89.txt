
A new report prepared for the Iowa Department of Human Services estimates that about three-quarters of Iowans who lacked health insurance last year remain uninsured,Â  reports DesMoinesRegister.com . About 305,000 Iowans lacked health insurance last year, according to the Milliman consulting firm. Roughly 75,000 of them have gained coverage, either through public efforts, such as Iowa's version of an expanded Medicaid program, or through private insurance policies, often purchased with public subsidies. But about 230,000 Iowans still are without coverage.
