
The UN Security Council will convene a meeting today to discuss the status of the UN Interim Security Force for Abyei, UNISFA, whose mandate will come to an end this month.

The head of the UN Special Envoy for South Sudan and Sudan, Haile Menkerios and the Commander of the UN peacekeeping force in Abyei, Major General Yohannes Gebremeskel Tesfamariam will brief the Council in a closed-door session.

The two will inform the Security Council on the achievements and challenges during the execution of the UNISFA mandate in Abyei area.

They will also highlight on the provision of protection to the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism.

The US is also expected to present a draft resolution on the mandate of UNISFA, as the current one expires on the 31st of this month.

The spokesperson in the Office of the President, Ateny Wek Ateny told Eye Radio that the government has no objection to the renewal of UNISFA mandate in Abyei area.

“Well it is the Ethiopian government itself saying that if South Sudan and Sudan don’t support the initiative, they will continue to support military presence in Abyei,” Mr Ateny.

The United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei was formed by the UN Security Council to respond to the urgent situation in the Abyei region.

The Force is charged with taking necessary actions to protect civilians under imminent threat of physical violence, irrespective of the source.

However, UNISFA has been criticized by the residents of Abyei for failing to provide adequate protection to the civilians.

Last year, leaders of the Ngok Dinka accused it for failing to protect the former Paramount Chief, Kuol Deng Kuol, who was killed by armed men in Abyei.
