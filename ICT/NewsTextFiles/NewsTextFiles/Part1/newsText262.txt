
Baker Hughes, the fourth-largest oilfield equipment supply and service company in the Houston area and one of the largest in the world, built the facility to centralize its training operations and pare down its seven disparate training centers into just one location.

Company executives and officials from Tomball and Harris County attended the May 15 event debuting the Western Hemisphere Education Center at the intersection of FM 2920 and FM 2978.

The building will include 21 classrooms with six more on the way, and will be able to house 500 students and 100 training personnel.

Baker Hughes will use the facility as a cross-training space to instruct its employees in mechanical and electrical skills and for field operations on its rigs and wells.

According to Community Impact News , Tomball Mayor Gretchen Fagan estimated that the center would bring in $8 million in tax revenue to the city over the next 10 years on top of the business from 5,500 trainings visiting the center every month.
