THE NUMBER of citrus orchards in the tristate region registered to export navel oranges to China has doubled since last year, which could see China overtake the US as the industry’s third biggest export customer this season, behind Japan and Hong Kong.

Growing market: Judith Damiani says Australian citrus growers are exporting their fruit to China.

“If you combine China and Hong Kong, they’re easily our biggest export market,” Citrus Australia chief executive Judith Damiani said yesterday,

She said the prospective increase in exports to China was welcome evidence that more Australian growers were looking beyond the domestic market, and making the effort to meet the strict export protocols agreed between China and Australia.

“China is a market that demands premium, high-quality fruit – it’s very expensive for growers to prepare their orchards to export to China,” Ms Damiani said.

Ms Damiani said that Australian citrus exports to China were subject to the same strict controls that had previously applied during the development of its now lucrative export market in Japan.

“Japan was our toughest export market for a few years, but we’ve demonstrated that we can meet their protocols, and manage pests of concern,” she said. “Fuller’s Rose Weevil is not a major pest of Australian orchards, but it’s a pest of major concern to China.

“Rather than demonstrate that our orchards are free of the pest, which would be very expensive for growers, we need to prove our shipments are free of it, so we’re running a number of trials to see what works best.
