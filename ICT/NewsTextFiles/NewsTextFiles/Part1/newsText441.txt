
(AP)  A federal judge threw out Oregon's same-sex marriage ban Monday, marking the 13th legal victory for gay marriage advocates since the U.S. Supreme Court last year overturned part of a federal ban.

State officials earlier refused to defend Oregon's voter-approved ban, and said they'd be prepared to carry out same-sex marriages almost immediately if the judge struck it down.

The National Organization for Marriage sought to argue in favor of the ban. But both U.S. District Judge Michael McShane in Eugene and a federal appeals court rejected its attempts to intervene.

Jubilant couples rushed to tie the knot following Monday's ruling, including some who stood in line at the Portland county building for hours to get a marriage license.

"It's the final step to be truly a family," said Patty Reagan, who took the day off to wed partner Kelly. "Everyone else takes for granted that they have this right."

Opposition remains stiff in many places, with critics pointing out that most states still prohibit gay marriage.

The Oregon Family Council released a strongly worded statement Monday saying the state colluded with gay-rights groups to sidestep the will of voters, and a judge allowed it.
