
Iran will start exporting natural gas to Iraq early next Iranian calendar year (starting March 21, 2015), says a senior Tehran energy official.

In July 2013, Iran and Iraqi officials agreed for 25 million cubic meters of Iranian gas to be delivered to Iraqi power plants in Sadr, Baghdad and al-Mansouryah through a 270-kilometer (167-mile) pipeline.

â€œGas exports to Iraq will start early next [Iranian] year and upon the completion of the pipeline,â€� said Deputy Oil Minister for International Affairs and Trading Ali Majedi on Monday.

According to official reports, the construction work of the gas pipeline has shown a 75-percent progress.

The pipeline will stretch from Assalouyeh, near the massive offshore South Pars oil and gas field in southern Iran, into neighboring Iraq to feed Iraqi power plants running on gas.

The South Pars gas field is located in the Persian Gulf on the common border between Iran and Qatar. The field is estimated to contain 14 trillion cubic meters of gas and 18 billion barrels of condensates.

Iran, which sits on the world's second largest natural gas reserves after Russia, is making efforts to up its gas production by increasing foreign and domestic investments, especially in South Pars gas field.
