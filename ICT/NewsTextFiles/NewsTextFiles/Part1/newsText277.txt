
Students at the University of Colorado's Boulder campus donated 51,400 pounds of unwanted items to Goodwill at the end of the spring semester, an increase of nearly 61 percent over last year, according to Goodwill.

Goodwill Denver partnered with CU and other campuses around the state to host on-campus donation drives as students cleaned out their dorm rooms and apartments for the summer. The drives are intended keep used items out of landfills, according to a news release.

Many students moved out of their dorms and apartments in early May after spring semester finals.

Last year, students on the Boulder campus donated 32,000 pounds to Goodwill. The marked increase could be because Williams Village did not host its annual garage sale event, where students sell unwanted items to other students, Goodwill officials said.
