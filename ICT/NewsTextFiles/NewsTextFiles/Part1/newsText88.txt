BANGOR, Maine (NEWS CENTER) -- The University of Maine System trustees met on Sunday. Among other issues, they discussed the budget.

They are reviewing the system's proposed $529 million dollar budget.

There is also a proposal to continue a tuition freeze, if state appropriation is not reduced.

If the budget is approved by the board, it would mark the first time since 1987 that there is not an in-state tuition increase for three consecutive years.
