Pull up your pants, people.

That's the message the city of Pikeville, Tennessee, is sending its residents with a new law banning saggy pants. Anyone whose "britches" are more than three inches below the top of their hips will be fined $25 for a first offense and "not more than" $50 for repeat offenses, according to the Chattanooga Times Free Press .

The newspaper reports the Pikeville City Council unanimously approved the ordinance during its first reading last week. The law is expected to take effect in a few months if it passes two more readings.

According to the Daily Mail , officials say the fashion measure isn't just about public indecency -- it's a health issue.

"There is evidence that indicates that wearing sagging pants is injurious to the health of the wearer as it causes improper gait," the ordinance states. It did not elaborate on evidence or specific negative effects.

Other cities and states have made similar efforts to ban " pants on the ground " over the years.

In 2007, a Louisiana town banned low-hanging pants that exposed underwear. An Ohio man got sentenced to 3 days in jail for violating a judge's court room dress code in 2012. A Dallas-area McDonald's franchise owner banned "sagging" at his 25 restaurants last year.

New York State Senator Eric Adams made headlines in 2010 when he put up billboards campaigning to "Stop the Sag" and improve the image of baggy-pants wearers. A New York City man was ticketed that year for wearing saggy pants, but a judge ruled his wardrobe choice was foolish -- not illegal.
