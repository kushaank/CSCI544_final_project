
"Ladies and gentlemen,

It is a great pleasure to welcome you here today for the award of the 2014 Prix MEDIA.

The Prix MEDIA honours screenwriters and a production company who have developed a high-quality film project with strong Europe-wide potential.

I am delighted to say that this year's Prize goes, once again, to an outstanding creative team.

The authors of the winning project are Bosnian director Danis Tanović and screenwriter Predrag Kojović.

Danis Tanović has captivated our imaginations over the years with masterpieces ranging from his first feature, the wonderful No Man's Land, to his most recent film, An Episode in the Life of an Iron Picker. No Man's Land won the Oscar for best foreign film and his films have earned countless other accolades.

His latest project, and today's winner, is for a film project called What Are You Looking At?, which examines life in a city during a period of transition lasting almost 20 years. It was submitted by the Bosnian production company pro.ba and received a glowing assessment from our jury, both for its artistic content and for its development, production and distribution strategies.

In fact, this was also the case for last year's laureate of the Prix MEDIA, Thomas Vinterberg, whom I wish to congratulate today for his nomination for best foreign film at this year's Oscars for the MEDIA-supportedThe Hunt.

Hopefully, this will be a good omen for today's winners.

So it gives me great pleasure to present this award to Danis Tanović, to his co-writer Predrag Kojović and to their producer Amra Baksić Camo from pro.ba for their project, What Are You Looking At?.

My sincere congratulations to you all."
