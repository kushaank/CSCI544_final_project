Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley â€œhad no involvementâ€� and said it was Interim City Manager Scott Stiles â€™ decision not to propose capital funds for the Port of Greater Cincinnati Development Authority in the cityâ€™s proposed budget.

â€œThe mayor had no involvement in deciding what the administration put in the budget regarding port funding,â€� said Cranleyâ€™s spokesman, Kevin Osborne .

Cranley did propose $700,000 in operations funding for the Port Authority and leasing the Fountain Square South Garage to the port, which would provide a $1 million annual revenue stream to the organization over the next 30 years.

â€œIf you want to know why $6 million was not included, ask the administration,â€� Osborne said.

An email to the cityâ€™s interim spokeswoman, Michele Ralston , was not returned on Monday.

The comments from the mayorâ€™s office came two days after Councilman Chris Seelbach raised objections to two aspects of Cranley and Stilesâ€™ budget in a letter to interim budget director Peggy Sandman .

Cranley and Seelbach, both Democrats, have been at odds all year over Cranleyâ€™s proposed policy changes compared with those of former mayor Mark Mallory and city manager Milton Dohoney , including Cranleyâ€™s failed attempt to cancel the streetcar project. Seelbach also is concerned that Cranley has taken a bigger role in running the city than the city charter prescribes for the mayor. The charter designates the city manager as the cityâ€™s chief executive officer.

Seelbach noted that eight council members signed a motion directing the administration to allocate $6 million in capital funding to the port authority for its neighborhood redevelopment efforts. Osborne said that motion never emerged from a council committee for a formal vote.
