
The verse is from 'The Essential Rumi,' which is a compilation of Rumi poems as 'translated' by Coleman Barks and John Moyne.

Hollywood star Brad Pitt showed off his latest tattoo to photographers in New Orleans on May 17, which features a translation of a Rumi verse – but figuring out what it actually says is proving to be easier said than done.

“Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field. I’ll meet you there,” reads the tattoo on the inside of Pitt’s right bicep in three lines of black lettering.

Although it initially looks easy to comprehend, one should read the whole poem, if possible in its original Persian, to understand it completely, like in all the works of the great mystic.

Because the book doesn’t have footnotes or references showing the original versions of selected Rumi poems, it is hard to explain the meaning or verify the accuracy of the lines on Pitt’s bicep now.

All in all, whatever its true meaning is, Pitt’s new tattoo is yet another proof how Rumi still bridges cultures and nations, whether in Hollywood or Turkey or Iran.
