
ANTIOCH, Tenn. â€“ Members of a Mid-State church that burned down in a dramatic fire last year now have something to look forward to.

This weekend, members of the Bell Road Church of the Nazarene in Antioch gathered for the groundbreaking of their new church on the same property.

For 16 months, the membership has had to worship out of another church, while plans for the new one were being developed.

Construction issues and a change in contractors delayed the groundbreaking until now, but the church pastor said the wait will be worth it.

Russell said if construction goes as scheduled, the church hopes to open its doors by Thanksgiving of 2014.
