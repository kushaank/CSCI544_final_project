
The largest coalition of Islamist rebels in Syria released a manifesto that calls for the increasingly fractious rebels to unite around the notion of liberating the country from the government of President Bashar Assad and installing a free state that will protect the rights of religious minorities, not an Islamist state.

The position spelled out in the statement, titled the âRevolutionary Manifesto of the Islamic Front,â marked a reversal of a policy articulated last year that called for establishing an Islamist state in the defeat of Assad. Analysts and observers agreed that the statement seemed directed at the international community, particularly the United States, which has been reluctant to support widespread military aid for the rebels over concerns about radicalism.

The statement, released as an audio posting on jihadi websites, was said to have the support of the Islamic Front's leadership, including Hassan Abboud, the leader of a conservative militant group, Ahrar al-Sham, whose founders include members of al-Qaida. Ahrar al-Sham is thought to be the largest group in the Islamic Front.

The statement was attacked by the most radical groups in the anti-Assad movement, al-Qaida's Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, an al-Qaida-inspired group that's broken with al-Qaida over tactics in Syria. Analysts said the denunciation of the statement lent it credibility as a sincere policy position.

The manifesto âseems sincere considering the rabid response against it by (Nusra) and its supporters/sympathetic ideologues,â said Aaron Zelin, who studies radical Islamist groups as a fellow at the Institute for Near East Policy in Washington.
