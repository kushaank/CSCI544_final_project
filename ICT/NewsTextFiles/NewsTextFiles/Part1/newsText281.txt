
The Governing Board of Saugus Union School District will hold a Public Hearing on Tuesday, May 20, 2014 at the Saugus Union School District, 24930 Avenue Stanford, Santa Clarita, California, 91355, 7:30 PM.  This hearing will be to review the Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) to be put in place during the 2014-2015 school year.   The Governing Board encourages parents, teachers, staff, members of the community, and bargaining unit leaders to participate in the public hearing.

The Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) is a critical part of the new California Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF).  We have been working with parents, educators, employees and the community to establish this plan. The plan describes the school district’s goals and specific actions to increase student achievement.  The plan also demonstrates how the district’s budget will be used to achieve the goals, and will assess each year how well the strategies in the plan improved student achievement.
