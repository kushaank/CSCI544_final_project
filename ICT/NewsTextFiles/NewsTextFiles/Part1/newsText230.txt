
SEOUL, May 19 (Yonhap) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will visit Seoul early next week to discuss an array of issues such as North Korea's nuclear problems and when the Chinese president will visit here, the Seoul's foreign ministry said Monday.

The Chinese foreign minister will arrive in the South Korean capital on May 26 for a two-day visit to meet with his Korean counterpart Yun Byung-se, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.

The two foreign ministers are expected to discuss the timing of Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Seoul and North Korea's nuclear issues, it added.

The Chinese diplomat will visit Seoul for the first time since he took office earlier last year in a follow-up to the visit by Yun to China in April 2013, it noted.

The visit also comes as North Korea has threatened to conduct its fourth nuclear test in anger over the United Nations' condemnation of its ballistic missile launches in March.

During phone conversations in April, the foreign ministers of South Korea and China agreed to make efforts to curb Pyongyang's provocations and maintain peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.

Seoul is seeking to move up the timing of Xi's visit to the first half of this year so that it can be used as an opportunity to deliver a message to North Korea to curb its nuclear ambitions, it said.

North Korea conducted nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and February 2013, drawing condemnation from the international community and tightened U.N. sanctions.

China is North Korea's key ally and economic benefactor, but it has become more frustrated with Pyongyang as a series of North Korea's provocations have heightened tensions in the region.
