The Victorian government has released a new ICT strategy targeting public Cloud, mobility technologies and greater community access to government data sets.

The push to give increased public access to government data sets also follows a similar recommendation from National Commission of Audit in relation to the proliferation of Big Data.

The commission advised that major departments be compelled to maximise use of their own data and accelerate the publishing of anonymised data for general use.

Technology minister, Gordon Rich-Phillips, said the new strategy for 2014-15 would focus on technology which improves service delivery to Victorians and provides greater productivity across the Victorian government in the face of rising demand for government services and tightened budgets.

Early last year saw the release of the Coalition Government’s first ICT Strategy, as outlined by the Victorian Auditor-General and Ombudsman in their November 2011 report.

Rich-Phillips said the government had committed to regular updates to the strategy to ensure that it took advantage of opportunities arising from the ever-evolving ICT industry.

"The government will continue to consult citizens and businesses in the development of government services using digital channels such as online and through mobile devices and applications.   "The Coalition government is responding to the community’s preference for transparency, greater flexibility, quick access to information and easier transactions," he said.

It is hoped the strategy will make it easier for Victorians and businesses to access government services online anywhere, anytime, as well as productivity improvements being realised in the public sector through smart use of technology.
