
The film has many autobiographical elements. Director Alice Rohrwacher herself is of German-Italian background, also grew up on a bee farm, and cast her sister Alba to play the mom. In a nod to her youth, and to underline this family's throwback nature, the film's time period remains intentionally unclear. Apart from a few oblique references to EU regulations and some music choices reflective of more contemporary tastes, there is nothing that dates the film in the 21st century. All the machinery, clothing and design are what you could call modern timeless, and there is not one piece of technology onscreen. The retro, 16mm film stock Rohrwacher shot the film on pushes the issue further.

Everything in the film has that earthy feel, tuned down and robbed of luxury. That includes the role played by Monica Bellucci. Look, Monica Bellucci is always going to be Monica Bellucci. No amount of grime is ever going to tame her megawatt beauty, dim her movie star aura. But the role she plays here, as the host of the cheesy pageant, is a canny bit of casting. She's not a film star, just a somewhat past-her-prime local TV host, but that makes her the more potent a figure. She's ethereal but native, elegant and tacky at the same time. Like the honey, she too is a product of 'the land'; proof that for all it takes, it is still able to produce wonders.
