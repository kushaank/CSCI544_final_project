
As outlined in the 2013-16 Strategic Plan (p58),AWI investment seeks to increase profitability through optimised breeding tools. Such measurement and benchmarking occurs through wether trial results, central test sire evaluation sites and Merinoselect's database of Australian Sheep Breeding Values (ASBVs).

In July 2013 the AWI Board refunded the AWI and Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) Sheep Genetics Agreement for research, development and extension in Merinoselect until June 2015.

The AWI Board has requested AWI management consult with ram breeders on the potential for further commercialisation of its three genetic benchmarking projects, Merinoselect, Merino Sire Evaluation and Wether and Ewe Trials. This consultation was to look at future roles and responsibilities of ram breeders and AWI and the relevant governance models that could be implemented in the future.

Here we go again. As usual,  a questionable  consultation process from AWI. And the AWI link doesn't even open. As the article says "Commercial woolgrowers pay the overwhelming cost of the R&D. Ram sellers contribute very little of the total investment."  So how about asking us commercial growers properly. By the way we are still waiting for Stuart and Wally to take a walk as a result of their failed top end marketing campaign. I won't hold my breath waiting. No accountability, yet again. Same old, same old.

John Hine, you couldn't be further from the truth about the AWB single desk. It left for dead,
