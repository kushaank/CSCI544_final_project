
PLATTSMOUTH â€“ A southern Nebraska woman will spend 24 months on probation for providing a false name to a state trooper when she was stopped in Cass County last year.

Ashley N. Lapointe, 27, appeared in Cass County District Court Monday morning for a sentencing hearing. Lapointe pled guilty last year to a Class IV felony count of criminal impersonation-first offense.

Lapointe committed the violation last year after a Nebraska State Patrol officer spoke with her near mile marker 426 on Interstate 80. The officer cited Lapointe for having an open container of alcohol. Lapointe gave her correct first name but provided a false last name to the trooper.

Lapointe told the court Monday she realized she had a problem with alcohol and was taking steps to correct it. She enrolled in intensive outpatient treatment after spending time in Lancaster County Jail for a similar offense last year. She has also attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and is planning to re-enroll in college.

Judge Jeffrey Funke said he hoped Lapointe could continue to steer her life in a positive direction. He said probation could provide additional structure for her as she continues her rehabilitation process.

Lapointe will begin serving a 24-month probation term immediately. She must abstain from alcohol, submit to all random drug and alcohol tests and continue going to AA meetings. She must complete moral recognition therapy and financial management classes and perform 50 hours of community service. She must also pay a $200 fine and all court costs within one year.
