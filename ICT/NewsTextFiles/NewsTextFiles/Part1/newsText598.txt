
Broward resident Andrew Ladanowski flagged Rothstein’s voting status and contacted state elections officials about it in recent days. Last year, Ladanowski publicized the fact that convicted felon O.J. Simpson remained on Miami-Dade’s voter rolls — he was later removed.

“Felony convictions are received at the state level and the removals take place there,” said Mary Cooney, a spokeswoman for Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes.

Rothstein registered as a Republican in 1998 and last voted in the 2008 presidential election, Cooney said.

Rothstein, the former head of the Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler law firm, pleaded guilty to federal charges related to a Ponzi scheme and was sentenced to 50 years in prison in 2010. About 20 individuals linked to the scheme have been convicted.
