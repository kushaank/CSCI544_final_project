
Traumatised by his mothers horrific death one year on, Jason Collins has been repeatedly admitted to hospital with depression.

The 19-year-old said he was plagued by nightmares and is slowly wasting away in his grief for his late mother, Rachelle Rowlinson, 43, even losing his teeth due to the stress.

Had she not been killed by Paul Richard Wheeler, Mr Collins said: 'I would probably be in the army now and my mum would be so proud of me'.

'Now I have no-one.'

Ms Rowlinson was said to be a popular woman who was fiercely protective of her two children, both Mr Collins and her five year old daughter.

Wheeler, 44, was acquitted of her murder but found guilty of manslaughter by a South Australian District Court jury in February.

Rachelle 'Sassy' Rowlinson died on Good Friday last year from a single stab wound to the chest at Eudunda in the state's mid-north.

In his victim impact statement read to the court on Monday, he said he felt dead inside and was in a constant state of grief.

The prosecution alleged Wheeler killed her out of jealousy after arguing with her and a mutual male friend, after the trio had been drinking heavily at a hotel.

Wheeler told the jury he acted in self-defence and said Ms Rowlinson impaled herself of the knife during a drunken fight.

The sentence hearing was adjourned to June 24 to enable a psychological report to be obtained on Wheeler.
