
Southern PR will host its second women's charity function       next week, again raising money for the New Zealand Breast       Cancer Foundation.

An afternoon tea at the Crowne Plaza's threesixty restaurant       will raise funds for the Pink Ribbon initiative, with all       money raised going towards funding breast cancer research       projects and medical grants for those affected.

Southern PR director Fiona Woodham said she was ''thrilled''       to host another afternoon tea for the charity - last year's       event raised $2227.

''We're looking forward to putting on another fabulous       function for a great cause which is very close to my heart.

''We decided last year to do something a little bit different       to the many Pink Ribbon breakfasts that are held around New       Zealand and the afternoon tea idea was such a huge success       we've continued on with that tradition.

''We're encouraging all the local ladies to come along, enjoy       a cup of tea, coffee or something a bit stronger, and maybe       even win an amazing prize. It's a lovely fun afternoon and       all for a very worthwhile cause.''

The event will be held on May 29 from 3.30pm to 5.30pm.

Entry costs $10, to go to the cause along with money raised       through raffles and a silent auction.
