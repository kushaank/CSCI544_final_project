
CAIRO â€“ An Egyptian court on Sunday sentenced 37 supporters of ousted president Mohamed Morsi to 15 years in jail for attempting to bomb two metro stations in capital Cairo last October.

The same court slapped a minor with a three-year jail term for involvement in the same case, according to Anadolu Agency reporter.

The court convicted all 38 defendants of possessing explosives and using them, damaging public properties and joining a "terrorist" organization.

It also charged them with attacking policemen and possessing firearms.

Morsi's supporters staged protests inside two Cairo metro stations in October before policemen arrested 38 of them, including the minor.

Sunday's verdicts can be appealed at a higher court.

Egyptian authorities have launched a major crackdown on the supporters of Morsi following his ouster by the army on July 3.

The interim authorities designated the Muslim Brotherhood, the movement from which Morsi hails, as a "terrorist" movement in December last year.
