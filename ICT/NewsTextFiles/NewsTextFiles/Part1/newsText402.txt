
New research from Harvard indicates that a very popular insecticide may be resulting in unintended consequences for humanity's food supply.

Over the past decade, CCD has become a major problem , leading to a 40% loss in commercial honeybees in the U.S. since 2006 and a 45% loss in the U.K. since 2010. It's believed CCD has wiped out an estimated 10 million beehives, worth $2 billion, over the past six years.

In 2007, England's National Audit Office examined data to determine the value of honeybees to the U.K. economy and found that their services equated to roughly $336 million a year. The retail value of what bees pollinate comes out to about $1.7 billion annually.

The University of Illinois estimates that in North America around 30% of the food humans consume is produced from bee pollinated plant life. The value of pollination by bees is estimated around $16 billion in the U.S. alone.

The science: In the Harvard research, the insecticide in question led to half the colonies studied dying. Meanwhile, none of the untreated colonies saw their bees disappear.

"We demonstrated that neonicotinoids are highly likely to be responsible for triggering 'colony collapse disorder' in honeybee hives that were healthy prior to the arrival of winter," Chensheng Lu, an expert on environmental exposure biology at Harvard School of Public Health and who led the work, told the  Guardian .

What's most troubling is that the culprit is one of the world's most widely used insecticides; it's undoubtedly going to be very difficult to transition from this chemical any time soon. Neonicotinoids are used in over 120 countries, mainly to boost agriculture production. They make up a quarter of the world's total insecticides used around the world. Neonicotinoids are effective against plant and soil insects, and also used to control fleas on domestic animals.
