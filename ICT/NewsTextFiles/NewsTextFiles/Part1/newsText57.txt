
KAJANG: The Magistrate's Court here acquitted a real estate consultant of a charge of locking two ballot boxes without authority in the 13th general election (GE13) last year.

Magistrate Abdul Jalil Salam Mohamad said the prosecution which called eight witnesses during the hearing, had failed to prove a prima facie case against Susan Lee Pek Sim, 55.

Lee who was a polling agent for the DAP candidate in the Serdang parliamentary constituency was charged on May 3 last year.

She allegedly locked the two ballot boxes with her own padlocks after voting ended at the polling centre at the Squadron 21, Royal Engineers Army Regiment (Territorial Army) hall in Kajang Utama at 7.15pm on April 30, 2013.

She was charged under Section 3(1)(i) of the Election Offences Act 1954, which carries a maximum jail term of two years or RM5,000 fine or both, upon conviction.

The prosecution was conducted by deputy public prosecutor Mohamad Azari Harun and Siaw Chooi Chin while Lee was represented by counsel Edmund Bon and New Sin Yew.
