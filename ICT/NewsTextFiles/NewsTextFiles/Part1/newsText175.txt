
Wyndham Hotel Group has opened Super 8 Riyadh, the first property for the economy hotel brand in the Europe, Middle East, Africa and Indian Ocean region, firmly targeting the growing domestic tourism sector.

Super 8 Riyadh is the first hotel to open as part of a master development agreement with Saudi Automotive Services Company (SASCO) for 20 Super 8 hotels in Saudi Arabia over a period of five years, Hotelier Middle East reported.

Wyndham claimed the brand, which is celebrating its 40th anniversary this year, has more properties than any other economy hotel chain in the world, with over 2,400 throughout the US, Canada, China and Brazil.

“We are thrilled to introduce the globally recognised Super 8 brand to Saudi Arabia, a unique economy concept in the market,” said Wyndham Hotel Group senior vice president and managing director, Europe, Middle East, Africa and Indian Ocean Rui Barros.

“The Super 8 Riyadh will serve as a comfortable place to rest for road travellers throughout the Kingdom, making it ideal for the long highways and the growing number of car journeys in the market."

Situated close to King Khalid International Airport, Super 8 Riyadh offers 57 guest rooms and suites.

The brand has several agreements in place to expand its presence further throughout the EMEAI region. In February, Wyndham announced the groundbreaking of Germany’s first Super 8 in Munich, part of an agreement with Tristar Hotel GmbH to open 10 Super 8 hotels in Germany.

Last year the company also signed a multi-year agreement to open 20 Super 8 hotels throughout Turkey.
