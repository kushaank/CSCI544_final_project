
The president of Papua New Guinea's Midwifery Society says she is not optimistic that Australian Government aid will provide 500 new midwives by next year.

The Australian Government has been offering up to 500 scholarships to study midwifery in PNG since 2011, but the Pacific Adventist University Midwifery School in Port Moresby takes only 20 per year.

Dr Nancy Buasi told Pacific Beat the government's target of 500 new midwives by next year seems unachievable, given a significant lack of teachers.

"We would like to train lots more midwives, but at the moment problem is manpower to train the number of midwives as well as facilities," Dr Buasi said.

"Had it started earlier, maybe we could have reached that figure by then, by 2015, but I think currently we don't have the quota."

Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop announced an additional $AU2.8 million funding package to upgrade facilities at Pacific Adventist University Midwifery School.

The Australian Government is also funding the refurbishment of four midwifery schools and building a fifth school to expand capacity.

Dr Buasi says it may take longer than a year to see the impact of the midwifery funding.

"With the funding coming in AusAID as well as the opening up of another school, I can say the impact won't be too immediate, becuase what we are doing now, we can't see the impact straight away," she said.
