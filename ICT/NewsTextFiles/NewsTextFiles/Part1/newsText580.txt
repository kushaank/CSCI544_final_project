
mHealth is an abbreviation for mobile health, a term used for the delivery of healthcare services with the use of communication devices, such as mobile phones, tablet computers and PDAs, for health services and information. mHealth monitoring and diagnostic medical devices is an emerging market and demand for this technology is evolving at a rapid speed owing to rising incidences of chronic diseases and increasing geriatric population. The technology substantially reduces healthcare expenditure incurred during hospital visits for monitoring vital parameters such as blood pressure, blood glucose, heart rate, respiratory rate and others.

According to The Center for Technology and Aging, the U.S. healthcare system could reduce the cost of healthcare expenditure by approximately USD 200 billion in the next 25 years through the implementation of remote patient monitoring technologies. Hence, this report is focused towards identifying the current scenario as well as the future market potential for mHealth monitoring and diagnostic devices, globally, with a special focus on medical devices like smartphones and tablets.

The mHealth monitoring and diagnostic devices market has been segmented into seven major product types, namely, glucose monitors, blood pressure monitors, pulse oximeters, cardiac monitors, sleep apnea monitors, multi-parameter monitoring devices and other monitoring devices (fetal monitors, neurological monitors, asthma monitoring devices).
