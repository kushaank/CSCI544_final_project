
Federal judge Dale A. Kimball has just issued a temporary injunction ordering the state of Utah to recognize the marriages of same-sex couples performed after its ban on same-sex marriage was ruled unconstitutional. About 1300 same-sex couples married in the Beehive State, and while Republican Governor Gary Herbert even acknowledged their unions were legal, he has refused to allow the state to recognize them. The judge stayed his ruling for 21 days to give the state time to respond.

Here's hoping this same order will require the state to recognize both spouses as parents for purposes of birth and adoption. The latter has been a particularly irksome one as the state had previously decided not to "recognize" adoptions which had already been completedâ€¦in direct contravention of state law.
