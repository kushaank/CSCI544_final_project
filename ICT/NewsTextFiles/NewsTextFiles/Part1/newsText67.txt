
The Supreme Court of India granted bail for three weeks to former editor of an Indian magazine, who is accused of sexually assaulting a colleague, to attend his mother’s funeral, BBC reported on Monday.

Tarun Tejpal, the founder of top investigative magazine Tehelka, is accused of raping a colleague in a hotel in the holiday state of Goa in November last year. The 50-year-old editor faces a possible rape charge that could see him in jail for 10 years.

According to his lawyer, his mother “expired last [Sunday] evening at [Mr] Tejpal’s Goa residence. The decision is yet to be taken whether the final rites would be conducted in Goa or Delhi,” Press Trust of India quoted the lawyer as saying.

Police have filed a case against Tejpal under sections of the criminal code including rape.

The victim, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, had earlier said in a statement to media groups that she was fighting to preserve her “integrity”.

Tehelka had reported forcefully on gender inequality in India in the past, highlighting police and judicial insensitivity to rape victims as well as the misogynistic attitudes of many Indian men.

It has been accused of hypocrisy and trying to cover up a serious crime after staff were sent an email saying Tejpal was stepping down for six months for “misconduct”.
