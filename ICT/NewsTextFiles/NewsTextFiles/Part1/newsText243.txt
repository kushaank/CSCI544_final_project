AN INVERELL man charged with a string of child pornography and drug offences has pleaded guilty.

Michael John Howitt has admitted to possessing child abuse material and cannabis after police raided his Inverell home last year.

The charges stem after investigators received information about illegal activities at the home.

Within days, detectives, police and officers from the Armidale Target Action Group obtained a search warrant and searched the home.

Inside they discovered six computers, external hard drives as a well as a DVD disc that were seized and forensically examined by specialists in Sydney.

Police allege they discovered child pornography material on the computer equipment sparking seven child abuse possession charges.

Howitt has also pleaded guilty to three charges of possessing cannabis.

The 42-year-old, who remains on bail, will be sentenced in August.
