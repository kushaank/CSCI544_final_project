Assemblyman Steve Katz, the pro-marijuana Republican, made a brief appearance in the documentary episode of HBO's "Vice."

The "Rocky Mountain High" episode , which first ran April 23, dealt with the explosion of legalized marijuana in the country and included a segment from a pro-marijuana investor meeting in Las Vegas in January.

"Ten years ago, can you imagine having the cojone (sic) or the foresight or the guts to be able to start a business like this?" Katz said. "In the next 24 months, prohibition, for the most part, gonna be over."

He received applause.

Katz voted against medical marijuana in the Assembly in 2012, then was ticketed in March 2013 on the Thruway near the Capitol for marijuana possession and speeding.

Soon after, Katz became an advocate of legalizing marijuana --- both for recreational and medicinal purposes -- and voted to legalize medical marijuana in New York last year.

In December, he announced he was teaming up with a California venture-capital firm to seek investments in the marijuana sector -- which led him to Las Vegas in January.

Another state Sen. Richard "Tick" Segerblom, a Democrat from Nevada, predicted under Nevada's legalization of medical marijuana last year: "Welcome to the future Amsterdam of the West."

The New York state Legislature is currently debating whether to legalize medical marijuana. A vote is planned tomorrow before the Senate Health Committee.
