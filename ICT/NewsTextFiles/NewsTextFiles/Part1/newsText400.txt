
The International Federation of Women Lawyers, FIDA, has frowned at the refusal of the management of a private Hospital in Mile 3, Diobu, Port Harcourt to discharge some mothers and their babies months after delivery.

The Chairperson of FIDA in the state, Florence Itamunola raised the alarm following a petition from the mothers to the Federation.

Itamunola alleged that over 6 mothers and their babies are currently being illegally detained in a room in the hospital since last year by the management of the hospital over their inability to settle their medical bills.

She also expressed worry over the health of the babies and their mothers whose right to freedom is being violated by the management of the private hospital.

“We got a report from some women who said the management of a certain hospital has refused to let them go. The report is very disturbing.

“We are worried about the health of the mothers and their babies. The babies don’t even have access to immunization. And you know the importance of immunization for children. We have petitioned the Nigerian Medical Association and other necessary agencies”, she said.

In the meantime, the Rivers State Chapter of the Nigerian Medical Association has condemned the action of the private hospital.

The NMA Chairman, Ibitrokoemi Korubo said the action of the hospital was against medical practice to detain patients who cannot pay their medical bills.

Doctor Korubo, however, assured that NMA would investigate the matter and come out with a resolution soon.
