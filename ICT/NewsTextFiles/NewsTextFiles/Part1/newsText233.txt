
Pope Francis visits the Holy Land beginning this Saturday, May 24, on his second trip since becoming the head of the Roman Catholic Church last year. His first stop is in Jordan, where he will visit the place many Catholics believe Jesus was baptized. VOA’s Scott Bobb reports from Bethany, on the Jordan River.

This is an important stop during the pope’s upcoming visit to Jordan, according to local guide Baker al-Ziadat. “This is holy land. And the people come here to [be] baptized in the river and to visit the churches,” said al-Ziadat.

Archeologists have uncovered 1,500-year-old foundations of ancient churches. They believe this to be the actual site of Jesus’ baptism before time changed the river’s course.

The pope also is to meet with refugees from the conflicts in neighboring Syria and Iraq. Jordan has accepted hundreds of thousands of people displaced by war, notes the counselor at the Vatican embassy in Amman, Monsignor Mauricio Rueda.

Simon Shomali, who runs a souvenir shop near the baptism site, said he hopes the pontiff will bring inspiration to the region. "We are Christians who are praying for the peace. We think people should respect the footsteps of Jesus, where he was living. Wherever he went, we can watch [follow] his footsteps,” he said.

The Vatican said Francis will carry his message of peace across the river when he visits the West Bank and Israel [Bethlehem and Jerusalem] later in this trip.

Jewish people from across Europe and Russia have been immigrating to Argentina for hundreds of years. They brought with them dance music that was eventually mixed with Argentine tango. The result is Yiddish tango -- a fusion of melodies and cultural experiences that is still evolving today.  Elizabeth Lee reports on how one band is bringing Yiddish tango to Los Angeles.
