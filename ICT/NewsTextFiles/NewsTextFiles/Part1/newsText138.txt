Police in South Australia will search again for the body of missing former Waikato man Gordon Hamm, Australian media has reported.

Three men have been charged over the 34-year-old's disappearance after he was allegedly bashed and abducted at gunpoint.

Police fear Mr Hamm, who had been living in Mt Gambier, South Australia, was murdered after the kidnapping in the tiny seaside town of Nelson, close to the South Australian-Victorian border.

He was last seen in July last year after taking a shopping trip to Portland on the southwest coast of Victoria.

Two men, aged 29 and 35, both from Mount Gambier, have been charged with his murder and another, aged 21, has been charged with being an accessory.

ABC Online reported today that Victorian homicide detectives had travelled to the southeast of South Australia in an effort to find new information in the case.
