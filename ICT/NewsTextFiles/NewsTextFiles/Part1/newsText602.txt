An army (from Latin arma “arms, weapons” via Old French armée, “armed” (feminine)), in the broadest sense, is the land-based military branch , service branch or armed service of a nation or state . It may also include other branches of the military such as the air force via means of aviation corps. Within a national military force, the word army may also mean a field army an army composed of full-time career soldiers who 'stand over', in other words, who do not disband during times of peace. They differ from army reserves who are activated only during such times as war or natural disasters .

In several countries, the army is officially called the Land Army to differentiate it from an air force called the Air Army, notably France . In such countries, the word "army" on its own retains its connotation of a land force in common usage. The current largest army in the world, by number of active troops, is the People's Liberation Army of China with 2,250,000 active troops and 800,000 reserve personnel followed by the Indian Army with 1,325,000 active troops and 2,142,821 reserve personnel.

AL NUSTRA FRONT Suicide Bomber KILLS 4 in LEBANON - HEZBULLAH A suicide car bombing hit a gas station in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa town of Hermel on Saturday, leaving five people dead and 18 others injured. The Al Nusra Front in Lebanon has claimed responsibility for the attack. The al-Qaeda affiliated terrorist group, which made the claim on its Twitter account, has also claimed responsibility for a number of other recent attacks targeting Shiite populated areas in Lebanon. Saturday's bombing occurred shortly after 6 p.m. local time near the Al-Aytam gas station, triggering a big fire. Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the bombing and called for "national unity to protect our country and our people." "Once again criminals have targeted a Lebanese region and attacked innocent civilians," Mikati said in a statement by his media office. Meanwhile, prime minister designate Tammam Salam urged residents of Hermel to "exercise self-restraint despite the painful events they are going through." "This cowardly terrorist act must be a motivation for local factions to unite and block the road in front of sedition, and to support the army and the security forces that are exerting all needed efforts to prosecute perpetrator and bring them to justice. " Hermel, which is considered the heartland of Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, has recently been targeted by a wave of rocket attacks from the Syria. On Jan. 16, a car bomb near an army barrack in Hermel killed three people and injured more than 15 others. Shiite-populated areas in Lebanon have suffered a series of terror attacks after Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah announced last May that his Shiite party was fighting on behalf of the Syrian government in the civil war raging in neighboring Syria.  At least four people have been killed in a suicide attack in Hermel, a city in northeastern Lebanon. At least 15 others were injured as the Lebanon branch of the Al-Nusra Front claimed responsibility for the attack. The explosion, which came at around 1600 GMT send black plumes of smoke into the sky after a suicide bomber drove a Jeep Grand Cherokee into a petrol station in the Zahraa neighborhood of the city.  Fire trucks rushed to the Aytam gas station after security forces closed off the area for the firefighters to extinguish the blaze.  "At least four people were killed and more than 15 wounded, two or three of them in critical condition," Interior Minister Marwan Charbel told Hezbollah's Al-Manar television station. Other sources say that as many as 28 people were wounded in the blast.  "As the party of Iran [Hezbollah] continues to carry out crimes against our people in the beloved Aleppo and its insistence on sending more of its fighters into Syria, we had to stop its massacres and respond in kind against its stronghold so that the party can re-evaluate its position," a statement by the Al-Nusra Front in Lebanon said on its twitter account.

Officials in Chile say it could take more than 20 days to fully extinguish a forest fire in the hills around the port city of Valparaiso.  The blaze has killed at least 13 people, left thousands of people homeless and forced mass evacuations.  Chile's forestry agency, Conaf, said firefighters were still battling the wildfires, but it stressed that the situation was not "out of control".  On Sunday, President Michelle Bachelet declared the area a disaster zone.  Conaf's chief of national operations, Alfredo Mascareno, said the fire in Valparaiso, 110km (70 miles) west of the Chilean capital Santiago, covered a "large area".  "It has an area of 850 hectares (2,100 acres), which has a perimeter of about 22km and a length of 6km," Mr Mascareno told Chile's Cooperativa radio.  "There are residual fires remaining, which could increase in intensity because of the environmental conditions of heat and wind speed."  He said "it could taken even longer" than 20 days to fully extinguish the wildfires.  "I can't determine this at the moment, but it's effectively a long process," he concluded. Helicopters  On Monday, a forecast of cooler temperatures and higher humidity was expected to slow the fire's advance.  Firefighters are using helicopters to dump water on hotspots.  The city is built on a series of steep hills, separated by narrow winding streets, making the job of firefighters all the more difficult.  More than 10,000 residents in Valparaiso have been evacuated, and the fire has destroyed hundreds of homes since it began on Saturday.  The army has been put in charge of the evacuation, and security forces are on the streets to maintain order and prevent looting.  Schools were also closed on Monday in the city. 'Not leaving'  Temporary shelters have been set up for residents who were forced to flee, but some refused to evacuate.  "I will not let go of what little I have. This represents 15 years of effort, and until I can no longer see my house, I will not leave it," Arturo Gomez told the AFP news agency.  The Chilean Red Cross has appealed for donations, such as food and other basic supplies, to help those who were left homeless, and aid has been flowing from all over Chile.  The government said it would send 500 million Chilean pesos ($0.9m, £0.5m) to help the clean-up effort in Valparaiso.  "It's for emergency debris removal, but it is not the only aid that we're going to give. It is the first," government spokesman Alvaro Elizalde told a news conference.  "Thousands of people have lost everything... but the government will not leave them alone."  This is the second emergency that President Bachelet has had to face in the first month of her second term in office, after an 8.2 earthquake hit northern Chile on 1 April.  Fires are frequent in central Chile, where summer sends temperatures soaring.

Colombian authorities have arrested the unlicensed driver who fled his overcrowded bus after it burst into flames, burning to death 33 young children, an official said on Monday.  An evangelical church leader who had chartered the bus was also arrested, prosecutor Luis Gonzalez told a press conference.  The pair will be charged with aggravated manslaughter, he said, as Colombians expressed horror over Sunday's tragedy in the northern town of Fundacion that involved children aged three to 12.  The driver, who lost two of his own children in the fire, turned himself over to police as families sought to hunt him down following Sunday's tragedy in which, according to a witness, the bus went up in flames as he refuelled it with a jerrycan.  "A spark caused the fire," the prosecutor said.  The 56-year-old driver, Jaime Gutierrez, was later taken into formal custody, as was Manuel Ibarra, an evangelical church member who chartered the bus.  The children were returning from evangelical church services.  Fundacion Mayor Luz Stella Duran said another 20 were hospitalized, most of them with second- or third-degree burns.  Residents of the town had raced to join firefighters to extinguish the raging blaze, but it was too late.  "We wanted to get out a young girl who was holding out her arms by a window, but her skin was peeling off," witness Jose Guette, 48, told AFP.  "We couldn't do anything but hold our heads and watch the children burn."
