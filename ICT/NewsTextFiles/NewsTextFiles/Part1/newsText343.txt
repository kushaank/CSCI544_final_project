
A senior French official says his country supports the ongoing nuclear talks between Iran and the P5+1 group over Tehranâ€™s nuclear energy program.

Jean-FranÃ§ois Girault, French Foreign Ministryâ€™s director for North Africa and Middle East, made the remarks in a Sunday meeting with Iranian Foreign Ministryâ€™s Director-General for Western European Affairs Abolqassem Delfi, expressing hope that the talks between Iran and the six countries would bear fruit and lead to a final agreement.

Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council â€“ the US, China, Russia, France and the UK â€“ plus Germany wrapped up their latest round of the high-level nuclear talks in the Austrian capital Vienna on May 16.

Tehran and the six countries have been discussing ways to iron out differences and start drafting a final deal that would end the Westâ€™s decade-old dispute with Iran over the countryâ€™s nuclear energy program.

In November 2013, the two sides signed an interim nuclear deal in the Swiss city of Geneva that came into force on January 20.

Girault, who is in Tehran to attend the fourth round of political consultations between Iran and France, further said that Paris favors enhancement of relations with the Islamic Republic, adding that obstacles in the way of expanding bilateral ties should be removed.

The French diplomat expressed his countryâ€™s willingness to proceed with political talks with Tehran on bilateral ties and regional developments.

He said that last yearâ€™s meetings between the presidents and foreign ministers of Iran and France respectively on the sidelines of the 68th annual session of the UN General Assembly in New York and on the sidelines of the 37th session of the General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in Paris contributed to the resumption of Tehran-Paris political talks.

Delfi, for his part, expressed pleasure over the continuation of political talks between Iran and France and their useful results, stressing Tehranâ€™s determination to promote bilateral ties with Paris, particularly in the political, cultural and parliamentary spheres.
