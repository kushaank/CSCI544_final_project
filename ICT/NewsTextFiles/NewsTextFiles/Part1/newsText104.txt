
COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - State officials say they are winning the fight to get rid of a hemlock-killing bug at least in one southern Ohio state park.

The Ohio Division of Forestry says almost 700 hemlock trees in Hocking Hills State Park in Hocking County were treated last year with a pesticide that kills the woolly hemlock adelgid. Forestry experts didn't find any of the insects when checking the trees this spring.

The insect, which threatens millions of trees in the Midwest, was first reported in the eastern United States in 1951. It was found in Lawrence, Monroe and Vinton counties in 2012 and in Hocking County last year.

The insect feeds on nutrients at the base of hemlock needles and can kill the trees.
