
BEIJING — Increasingly isolated by the West over Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin will hope for a sympathetic ear on a visit next week to China, which is also being more assertive in its territorial disputes with smaller neighbours.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has made a public show of underscoring the importance of ties with Russia, and Moscow was the first capital he visited after assuming the presidency last year.

But, though they see eye to eye on many diplomatic issues, including the conflict in Syria, and generally vote as one on the United Nations Security Council, China has not proved so willing to support Russia on Ukraine.

Vasily Kashin, an expert on Russia-China relations at CAST, a Moscow-based defence think-tank, said Russia is likely to try to use Mr Putin’s trip to boost ties with China.

Mr Kashin said: "The only major economic power that is independent from the US and has stated support for Russia vis a vis sanctions is China."

"I think Putin does hope to win China’s support on the Ukraine issue. Because on this topic the US, the West, have joined up to create trouble in Ukraine which is aimed at Russia. And they are not only aiming at Russia," Liu Guchang, another former ambassador to Russia and a member of an advisory committee for the foreign ministry, told Reuters.

"This is a global strategy of the US and the West, to push for a Cold War. Once they are done with Russia, they will look to Central Asia and then China, using Japan." Mr Kashin said Mr Xi and Mr Putin are expected to talk about arms deals, and Moscow possibly giving Beijing "favoured status" on arms sales.

The visit could see a deal for Russia’s top producer Gazprom to pump gas to China, wrapping up a decade of talks in which price has been the main obstacle. Europe’s plans to reduce its dependence on Russian energy as the Ukraine crisis threatens supplies have spurred Gazprom’s efforts to finalise a deal.

A deal, seen as vital if Russia is to be a big player in Asian gas markets, could see Gazprom make price concessions.

Chinese oil industry officials remain cool, however, as growing prospect of North American gas exports to Asia from the shale revolution, and increased Turkmen production, means China can bide its time and also seek more access to Russia’s upstream assets.

"Unless Russia makes substantial changes in policies like allowing China more participation in Russia’s upstream oil and gas exploration, or involving Chinese in building the Russian part of the gas pipelines, there won’t be too much incentive for CNPC (state-run China National Petroleum Corp) to clinch a deal," said Chen Weidong, head of research at China National Offshore.
