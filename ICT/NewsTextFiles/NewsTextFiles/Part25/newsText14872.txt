
Pictures from the Marion County Sheriff's Office show part of the trooper's cruiser came off during the crash Sunday night.

According to the FHP, Trooper Raul Umana, 20, was going northbound on I-75 when he attempted to make a U-turn onto I-75 southbound. As he made the turn, he struck the guardrail and went into the travel lane, officials said.

A Nissan Altima driven by Christeia Jones, of Orlando, hit Umana's cruiser and then collided with a Mercedes E350 driven by Terry Scanes, of Miami.

Jones' car traveled into the path of a tractor-trailer driven by William Richmond, and both came to a rest on the shoulder of the interstate. The engine compartment of Jones' Nissan caught fire.

FHP said three children, ages 2, 5 and 7, in the Nissan Altima were flown by helicopter to Shands Hospital. The older children were not wearing seat belts, but the 2-year-old was in a car seat.

"Any time you deal with children, that's always a heartbreaking situation for all us on scene," said FHP Sgt. Tracy Pace.

Jones was also taken to Shands in serious condition. The other drivers had minor injuries.

The roadway was closed for six hours.

Charges are pending in connection to the crash.

Umana has been employed with FHP since August 2013.
