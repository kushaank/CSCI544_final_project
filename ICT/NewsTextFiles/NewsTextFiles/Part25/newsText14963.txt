
BANGKOK - The winner of Sunday's Miss Universe Thailand competition was forced to issue a public apology Monday after comments were reportedly found on her Facebook page calling for the "execution" of members of Thailand's pro-democracy movement.

“I promise this won’t happen again. I will use your criticisms to improve myself and do my best to perform my duty as Miss Universe Thailand,” she said.

Families, workplaces and friendships have split on political lines, parents have denounced children and violent clashes have frequently broken out between opposing sides.

In another instance, the father of 28-year-old Singha beer heiress Chitpas Bhirombhakdi announced in a letter sent to media in December that his daughter would change her surname, so as her political activities as a core anti-government protest leader could continue without damaging the family business.

The boycott became symbolic of the division in Thai society between an urban middle class which despises ex-Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra's populist government and provincials in the poorer north and north-east who feel their democratic right is not being respected, and are determined to maintain an administration which has delivered them clear material benefits.
