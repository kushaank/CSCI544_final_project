
Answer: 1,836 people who stood along Center Road in Brunswick to form the longest line of people wearing blue T-shirts in remembrance of seven high school students who’ve died since June 2012.

The event raised more than $5,000 for two nonprofit organizations: the Blue Pride Foundation, which was formed in the wake of student deaths and helps Brunswick families in need, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation, which grants wishes to children with terminal illnesses.

Students weren’t trying to set a Guinness World Record. Instead, they hoped to record the feat on www.record-setter.com , where visitors can self-submit evidence that they set a record and others can try to challenge or beat them.

The record-setting event was the brainchild of Patrick Meidenbauer, a St. Ignatius student and member of St. Ambrose Catholic Parish.

The church was also attended by four Brunswick students who were killed in a car crash in June 2012, marking the start of a string of tragedies for the city’s high-schoolers.

Kevin Fox, 18, Jeffrey Chaya, 18, Blake Bartchak, 17, and Lexi Poerner, 16, were killed after Chaya’s car crashed into a ditch and tree on Boston Road in Columbia Station.

In the two years since the crash, three other Brunswick students lost their lives: Brunswick senior Cora Flemming died in May 2013 after a battle with cancer, and two students — freshman Matthew Homyk and senior Anthony Gill — were found dead in what police say were suicides three days apart in January.
