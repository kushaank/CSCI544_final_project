
The takeover bidders for trans-Tasman bread and milk giant Goodman Fielder have no plans to break up the company or sell off the New Zealand dairy business, says a spokesman.

Goodman Fielder's board said late on Friday they would recommend shareholders accept the A70c a share offer from palm oil trader Wilmar International and investment company First Pacific.

The offer, which is subject to due diligence and shareholder approval, values Goodman Fielder at A$1.37 billion ($1.48b).

Bid spokesman Ross Thornton said there were four weeks of due diligence required before buyers Wilmar International and First Pacific could discuss their plans.

But "the current intention is to keep the entire asset base together," he said. "This certainly kills off the sale of the New Zealand dairy business."

After announcing a profit warning in April, Goodman Fielder said it had hired Credit Suisse to advise on options for its NZ dairy business, which markets milk and cheese brands such as MeadowFresh, Puhoi and Tararua.

Chief executive Chris Delaney said at the time there was "significant interest" in a dairy deal.

However, it appears that key shareholders Perpetual and Ellerston Capital saw more value in the takeover. The two agreed last week to sell a 9.8 per cent stake into Wilmar and First Pacific's offer if it won board approval.

Perpetual deputy head of equities Paul Skamvougeras told the Australian Financial Review the decision was all about value.

"It represented appropriate value for the company and was a reasonable price given the circumstances . . . "

Goodman Fielder shares fell from around A64c to A47.5c on the early April profit warning, but recovered after Wilmar and First Pacific made an initial offer of A65c on April 28. Yesterday they were trading around A69c on the ASX and 74c on the NZX.
