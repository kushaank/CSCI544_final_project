
NASHVILLE, Tenn. – A couple was caught in the act by police while attempting to burglarize a church in south Nashville over the weekend.

The Metropolitan Police Department charged 44-year-old John Quinton and 25-year-old Chelsea Bomar with two counts of burglary and one count of vandalism.

Police said they broke into the Woodland Hills Church of Christ on Old Hickory Boulevard near the Nippers Corner area in the early morning hours Friday. Quinton allegedly went inside to steal a flat screen television and a computer monitor while Bomar acted as a lookout outside.

The couple then allegedly came back a second time, but a homeless man in the area called police at 1:50 a.m. after hearing glass break.

Officers set up a perimeter and found Bomar inside a car in the rear parking lot. Quinton was taken into custody as he came running out of the building.

During an interview with detectives, Quinton allegedly admitted to breaking into at least one business and several churches, but claimed he couldn’t remember the exact locations.

Police said the couple remains under investigation, and believe they could be involved in other burglaries at businesses and churches in the area.

Detectives suspect the two were exchanging stolen property for drugs.

Quinton was held in lieu of $25,000 bond. Bomar’s bond was set at $22,500.
