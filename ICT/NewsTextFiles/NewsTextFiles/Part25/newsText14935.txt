
Offensive name-calling can be a "common experience" for Travellers in prison — both from other inmates and from some prison officers, according to a new report.

A small number of Travellers said they had also been subjected to “systematic discrimination”, including the dispersal of Travellers to other jails following a conflict between them and settled inmates in one jail.

The report, Travellers in the Irish Prison System: A qualitative study, said previously published figures showed Travellers were disproportionately locked up —  between five and 11 times more likely than other males.

The report by the Irish Penal Reform Trust, said the rate was much higher for Traveller women — 18 to 22 times more likely than women in general.

The problem was worse for male prisoners and there was a tendency among them to play it down.

The study found Travellers in prison also had literacy problems which presented a barrier to information and entitlements.

It said, while fights in prison were not necessarily seen as the norm, some male interviewees shared a strong awareness  the risks were real. The report noted if a Traveller was involved in a row in prison, that increased the likelihood of a relative being attacked.
