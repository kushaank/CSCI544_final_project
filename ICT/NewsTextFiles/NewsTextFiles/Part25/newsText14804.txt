
South Lyon police are asking for the public�s assistance in finding a man who exposed himself at a Dairy Queen.

Police said around 2:30 p.m. Sunday May 18 three girls were walking to their parked vehicle at the ice cream shop when they noticed a man sitting in a car parked next to them. The man was seen masturbating, police said.

The girls left the area quickly. The suspect is believed to be in his mid-30s, husky build, light complexion, dark sandy blond, collar-length hair that straight but messy, and a scuffy beard with a �5 o�clock� shadow. He was wearing a dark T-shirt and aviator-style sunglasses with brown-tinted lenses.

He was driving a newer, red, 4-door, sporty-looking vehicle with a possible black strip across the back.
