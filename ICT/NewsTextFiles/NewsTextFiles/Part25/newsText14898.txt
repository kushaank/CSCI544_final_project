JACKSON, MI – Two men accused of underage drinking jumped from a third-floor balcony early Monday, May 19, when police arrived at an apartment on W. Michigan Avenue to investigate a loud party.

The fall or impact knocked one of the men, a 20-year-old, unconscious and he went to Allegiance Health, where he remained as of about 5:30 a.m., Jackson police Lt. Elmer Hitt said. Hitt was uncertain of his specific injuries, but the man was expected to be OK.

Police did not report the other man, a 19-year-old, had any injuries, Hitt said, and he received a citation for being a minor in possession of alcohol. Hitt said police will ask the city attorney's office to also charge the 20-year-old.

Officers were called about 1 a.m. to the Renaissance Apartments, 720 W. Michigan Ave. A person came to the door and the two men jumped from the balcony.

Hitt said no one else received citations for underage drinking.
