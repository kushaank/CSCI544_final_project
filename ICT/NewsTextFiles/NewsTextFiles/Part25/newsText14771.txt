New Orleans police have identified a man they said is responsible for Sunday's shooting in Algiers that left a 35-year-old man seriously injured.

Police are seeking 27-year-old Trae Williams, who they said will be booked with one count of attempted second-degree murder. The NOPD said Williams was identified from a photo lineup as the shooter who opened fire on a man just before noon in the 2100 block of Westbend Parkway .

The victim was hit by multiple gunshots to his face and neck, and was transported in stable condition, police said Sunday. They did not update his condition Monday.

Authorities ask anyone with information on Williams or the shooting to contact NOPD detectives Leonard Bendy or Theresa Morris at 504.658.6040 or 504.658.6045, or Crimestoppers at 504.822.1111.
