
Serbian authorities have ordered the urgent evacuation of a town where soldiers, police and volunteers have been battling to contain the raging Sava River before it can inundate the country's main power plant.

The coal-fired Nikola Tesla plant, which supplies electricity for half of Serbia and most of Belgrade, lies in the flood-hit town of Obrenovac, 16 miles upstream of the capital.

Serbian police chief Nebojsa Stefanovic ordered the town to evacuate because of an expected surge from the Sava.

It comes as Serbia and Bosnia continue to struggle with the worst flooding in south-eastern Europe in more than a century.

At least 35 people have died in five days of flooding caused by torrential rain.
