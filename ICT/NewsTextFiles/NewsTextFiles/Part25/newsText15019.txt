
Srinagar, May 19: In a major setback to forces, a group of militants Monday managed to give slip to security men after killing an army man and injuring three others in Chadoora in Central Kashmir’s Budgam district.

Sources said after receiving information about presence of some militants in a residential house at Kaisermulla Chadoora, Army’s 53 RR, SOG and CRPF personnel launched a joint operation and cordoned off the area.

They said three to five militants had already escaped from the area before cordon was laid by the troops. “The remaining two provided cover to their colleagues and resorted to heavy firing on armoured vehicle of army, causing death of an army man of artillery division”.

“After the brief firefight, militants also managed to slip away,” sources said and identified the deceased army man as Mushtaq Ahmad Mir of 162 Territorial Army.

Sources said the militants were hiding in the residence of a police constable.

Army spokesman Lt Col N N Joshi confirmed that one army man was killed and three others injured in the militant firing.

“The injured army men were shifted to army hospital for specialized treatment,” he said.

Joshi said search operation has been launched to track down the militants.

Police sources said wanted Lashkar-e-Toiba commander Qasim was among the militants who gave slip to troops.

“Qasim module of LeT has been responsible for many deadly attacks on security men since past few years in Srinagar, central Kashmir and south Kashmir. The module is also alleged to be responsible for the attack in Hyderpora on an Army convoy in June last year. Two militants of Qasim module have been killed by the forces but Qasim, mastermind of Hyderpora attack, is still at large,” they said.

“Qasim shifted his base from Srinagar outskirts to South Kashmir after the killing of Rehman Bhai who was commanding the outfit in South Kashmir. Mohammad Qasim is a Pakistani national and has reportedly infiltrated into valley in 2010,” they said.
