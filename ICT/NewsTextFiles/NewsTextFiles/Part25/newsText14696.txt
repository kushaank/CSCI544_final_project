
Ghaziabad police have recovered a stock of detonators from a scrap store after an explosion rocked Prem Nagar locality of Loni town in this district, police said Monday.

The scrap store belonged to Ram Prakash whose two sons -- Rinku (13) and Shivam (9) -- were critically injured Sunday when the explosion occurred while they were segregating scrap. The two were rushed to Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital in Delhi for treatment.

Ram Prakash told police he bought 21 bags of scrap from Mundka in Delhi Saturday. Of these, one bag contained 700 detonators, used for conducting explosions in mines.

"We have detained the scrap trader and informed the Intelligence Bureau. A case under the Explosives Act has been registered," said police officer Gorakh Nath Yadav.
