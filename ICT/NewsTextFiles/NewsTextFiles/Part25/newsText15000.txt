
MARIETTA â€” A Marietta woman and a Lawrenceville man were arrested last week after Marietta Police say they wounded two women during a shooting in the Franklin Road area.

At 5 a.m. on April 8, Marietta Police say Jervasa Wilder and Remy Johnson assaulted two women with a handgun by shooting each of them in the left shoulder.

Once Marietta Police officers arrived at the scene outside of an apartment off Franklin Road, they say they found two gunshot victims, a vehicle with multiple gunshot holes and shell casings in the street.

The warrant stated Marietta Police were also dispatched to a similar scene off Saint John Avenue.

Both Wilder and Johnson were identified in a photo lineup and arrested the next day on Delk Road. They each face two felony counts of aggravated assault.
