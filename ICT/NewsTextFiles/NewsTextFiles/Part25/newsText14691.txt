
Kenya: CORD leaders have argued there is no justification for payment of Sh1.4 billion to Anglo-Leasing companies.

They said the contracts were illegally procured and that Kenya should not commit to fraudulent dealings.

The Opposition also threatened to impeach President Uhuru Kenyatta over his directive to the Treasury to pay the debt. Kakamega Senator Bonny Khalwale asked why the Jubilee government is not implementing what was in the report when Uhuru chaired the Parliamentary Accounts Committee (PAC).

In 2006, Uhuru, then the Opposition leader, chaired the PAC, which authored the report that described the more than Sh50 billion contracts as a system hatched by a few individuals to continually fleece taxpayers.

Khalwale claimed Anglo Leasing companies were owned by two Indians and two Kenyans, whose names are in the report which Uhuru submitted when he was the PAC chairman.

“We are the representatives of the people, and if he goes on doing this he will be the first President in Kenya to be impeach ed,” warned Khalwale.

In particular, the Opposition coalition dared the National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich to authorise the payments and face censure Motion in Parliament and Senate.

Deputy Minority Leader Jakoyo Midiwo castigated the move to pay the two companies, terming Uhuru’s authorisation to pay as unconstitutional.

“This is will be the final onslaught to bad governance. Our people cannot keep on suffering because of a few individuals at Harambee House. If Rotich pays this Anglo-Leasing money then, we will jail you, humiliate you and recommend that you are hanged at Uhuru park in public, because this is people’s money and you are the accounting officer,” said Jakoyo.
