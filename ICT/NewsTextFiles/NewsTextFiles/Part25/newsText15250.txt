
The incident took place in the parking lot of the restaurant.

Anderson says he saw it all happen when he replayed the surveillance video, which will help police who say they had a vague suspect description.

“We gave them video that shows the perpetrator in the parking lot,” Anderson told NewsChannel 3.

As for more security the owner says there is not much more he can do he has security cameras and fencing surrounding the restaurant. Anderson says he feels as if his hands are tied and now hopes police will step up their game.

“We are one block from the railroad tracks on the wrong side. I think if we were truly in Ghent we will probably have a better feeling from police. But right now it’s just one of their things they are not active enough in our neighborhood,” he added.

Just past the railroad tracks is Plaza Del Sol. The owner, Ernesto Alonso, tells a different story.

“I think police are doing a great job,” Alonso said.

He says police respond quickly when needed but he heard the gun shots last night and says from now on he will do more than just rely on police.

“We are scared for us, scared for our customers we will take safety precautions as far as trying to light up our parking lot more like I said get some security here and make our customers feel safe,” Alonso said.

Neither of these owners wants to see a crime scene like last night ever again.

The victim in the shooting was transported to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital with non-life threatening injuries.

The suspect is described as a black male, between 5’7” and 5’10”, late teens to early twenties.

Anyone with information about the attempted robbery or shooting is asking to called the Norfolk Crime Line at 1-888-LOCK-U-UP.
