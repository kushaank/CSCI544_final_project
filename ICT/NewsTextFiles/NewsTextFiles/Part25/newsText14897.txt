
HOUMA, La. -- The investigation of the March 24 death of a 4-year-old girl who was attacked by her mother's dog has made no progress, and it won't until the girl's mother and her boyfriend agree to talk to authorities, Houma Police Chief Todd Duplantis said.

Mia DeRouen, 4, and her mother were sitting on their couch watching TV when the dog attacked them unprovoked. DeRouen did not survive the attack.

After nearly two months of trying to speak with Megan Touchet, the mother who was also injured in the attack, and her boyfriend, Kerry Dominique, detectives are still being told that they are reluctant to speak on the advise of their attorney, Duplantis said.

"We can't make them talk to us," Duplantis said.

Mia DeRouen and her mother were sitting on their couch watching TV when the 130-pound, 2-year-old dog attacked the pair unprovoked, police said. Touchet fought off the dog and was able to hand Mia to emergency responders through a window. Niko, the dog, was shot to death.

The investigation's last big development came over a month ago when another dog in the home at the time of the attack was tested for steroids, a test that came back negative. This led detectives to believe Niko also had not been injected with steroids to increase his size or aggression.

Since this revelation, the investigation, which last month Duplantis described as "aggressive," has come to a complete standstill.

"This is still an ongoing investigation, but there is no new news," Duplantis said.

After weeks of trying to talk directly to Touchet and Dominique, detectives have stopped trying, he said.

"They're exercising their constitutional rights to not talk to the police," Duplantis said. "We're not making any more efforts to talk to them."
