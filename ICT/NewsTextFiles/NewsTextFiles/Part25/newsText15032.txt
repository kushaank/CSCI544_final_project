
His employers were not impressed after Jonathan Williams' video went viral.

MONTCLAIR , N.J., May 19 (UPI) -- A New Jersey paramedic who was caught on camera voguing to a Rihanna song while driving an ambulance may have delighted the Internet, but didn't entertain his bosses.

Jonathan Williams was reprimanded after a video of him dancing while he was behind the wheel of an ambulance went viral.

It's no surprise that the video got the attention of Williams' employers, because even Rihanna herself was tweeting about it.

"It doesn't help our industry," Montclair Ambulance Unit Deputy Chief Frank Carlo told CBS New York . "It creates an unsafe environment. We stress safety with our staff. The public puts their trust in us. We put our trust in our EMTs, and we want that returned."

The New Jersey Department of Health, which licenses EMTs, declined to comment on the video.

According to Williams, he was off the clock when the video was taken. "I was out of service and heading home," he said. "I'd never do that with a patient on board."
