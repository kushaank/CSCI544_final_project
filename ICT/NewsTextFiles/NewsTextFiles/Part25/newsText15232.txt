
A councillor seeking re-election was punched in the street when politics spilled over into violence in Bradford.

Imdad Hussain, who is trying to retain his seat for The Peace Party in the Heaton ward, was canvassing in Bradford Road, Frizinghall , when he was attacked at the junction of Aireville Road yesterday afternoon.

Police were called and a man in his 20s was arrested on suspicion of assault.

Coun Hussain needed treatment at Bradford Royal Infirmary for suspected concussion.

Speaking today, Coun Hussain said he had already suffered political intimidation, including campaign posters being removed and personal attacks on social media, in the run-up to the elections on Thursday.

A West Yorkshire Police spokesman confirmed a man in his 20s had been arrested in connection with the incident. He was later released on bail pending further inquiries.

Labour’s Heaton ward candidate Nussrat Mohammed condemned the violence and said no Labour Party members were involved.

“I am standing to try to change the way the way we do politics in Bradford,” she said.

The other candidates in the ward are: Peter Davis (Respect), David Ford (Green), Sajid Mahmood (Con), and Mike McNally (Lib Dem).
