
ADEN:  Gunmen killed two soldiers in an ambush on an army patrol in southeastern Yemen on Monday, a security official said.

"Unknown gunmen opened fire at a military vehicle killing two soldiers," the source said. The attack took place at the entrance to Shehr, a coastal town in Hadramawt province.

The assailants fled, he said.

The ambush coincided with an army operation launched April 29 against suspected Al-Qaeda militants, centred on Abyan and Shabwa in the south and the central province of Baida.

But  Al-Qaeda is also firmly implanted in other regions, including Hadramawt.

Its Yemeni franchise,  Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, took advantage of a 2011 uprising that ousted veteran president Ali Abdullah Saleh to seize large swathes of the south and east.
