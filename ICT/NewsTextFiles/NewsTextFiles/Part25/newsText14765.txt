
A MAJOR restructure of Essex Police will see officers returning to towns and villages.

Chief Constable Stephen Kavanagh today announced plans to move 500 officers out of central hubs and specialist teams and into specific communities.

60 police officer posts are being cut, mainly from road policing and firearms units, as part of the plans to save £3million.

Essex Police is having to make cuts after Government grants were reduced.

It has to work with £78million less a year by 2016 than it had in 2010.

Mr Kavanagh said: "I believe the public want policing delivered locally.

"For me it is about locally based, locally accountable, locally led officers, PCSOs and staff delivering across a range of response, investigation and engagement responsibilities."

The changes will be made on September 1.

Mr Kavanagh added: "I have to think carefully about how resources are balanced across the county.

"I also have to ensure that, operating within a reduced budget, we continue to deliver effective policing to all our communities."

Police and Crime Commissioner Nick Alston welcomed the changes.

He said: "It is clear how highly local officers, PCSOs and police staff are valued.

"The Chief’s plan will ensure that there will still be neighbourhood constables and PCSOs.

"Crucially though, these neighbourhood teams will be supported by 500 more officers being moved into local policing roles, providing a real continuity of local service to victims of crime."

Oh, are we going back to the old tried and tested village policeman role!

500 officers based at HQ in Chelmsford, was the post this morning, now they are stating it was in a central role.

This i going to hurt someone and somewhere along the line.

If anyone can do it CC kavanagh & PCC Alston will get the job done.

Lets hope the internet backbiting and whinging will not start, it was at this moment time when The Eides of March with Baker appeared.

If it means 500 more feet on the ground the good one !

Bang on dude bang on !

Erm, I would wager a bet that only a very small percentage of people value PCSOs.  Obviously, Essex Police value them because they are cheap but I doubt most ordinary citizens thinks they are worth the money spent on them.

As far as cutting 60 police officers is concerned, I would rather 120 PCSO were cut and the 60 police officers were redeployed from policing traffic to policing the street.

Here we go again. Same old story. Its a great pity the Nick Alston doesn't stand up to his idol  in No 10 and tell him to his face exactly what he has done. Of course he wont do that. After all he is a Tory.

No Mr Kavanagh, as much as I would like to see it work, lets see what happens in a few months.

What will happen to the work formerly done by these 500?  My guess is that they will still do exactly the same but be located isomewhere else.  This seems like a smoke and mirrors effect to give the impression there are 500 more Officers.

"...Mr Kavanagh said: "I believe the public want policing delivered locally...."

If the judges did their job then we wouldn't need so many police chasing the same villains week in, week out.
