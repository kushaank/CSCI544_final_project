
Deputies shared this photo of Sheridan's car.

A person of interest in the death investigation of a Hernando County teacher has been arrested on murder charges in Hillsborough County.

Deputies spotted Jerome Sheridan's car at the Citrus Park Mall Monday night. Initial reports from the Hillsborough Sheriff's Office said Sheridan was taken to the hospital with self-inflicted wounds, but did not say anything more specific about the injuries.

Updates Tuesday morning said deputies later booked Sheridan at the Hillsborough County Jail around 2 a.m. on an out-of-county warrant for first degree murder.

The search for Sheridan began Monday after officials found Lee Anne Shoeman’s body inside her home on Meredith Drive. They were called to check on her after she did not show up for work at Central High School that morning.

They have not released how she died.
