Police have seized $175,000 of suspected stolen property and 50,000 cannabis seeds as part of a drug operation in Queensland’s north.

Investigators raided properties in the Townsville, Cairns and Mareeba regions as part of Operation Kilo Enhance, eventually arresting seven men.

Police allege they found 50,000 cannabis seeds during the search of an isolated property near Mount Garnet, in the Atherton Tablelands, on May 11.

Some of the items seized by investigators included tractors, a four-wheel drive, weapons and large farm machinery.

Detective Acting Senior Sergeant Adam Golding said the drug investigation went for 16 months.

“This was a major investigation targeting serious organised crime,” he said.

A 44-year-old Mareeba man, a 54-year-old Nome man, a 46-year-old Biboohra man, a 20-year-old Mooroobool man, a 48-year-old Pimlico man, a 43-year-old Oak Valley man and a 46-year-old Stuart man were charged with drug and weapons offences.

The Mareeba and Oak Valley men were granted bail.

The group of seven will face the Townsville and Mareeba magistrates courts in the coming months.

The opening span of Riverwalk is commissioned on Tuesday, with boaties required to call Council and wait "5 to 8 minutes" for it to open.
