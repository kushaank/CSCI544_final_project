
A 68-year-old woman has killed her husband and critically injured her daughter and son-in-law after accidentally plowing her SUV through her house and crashing it into a lake - all while her 3-year-old grandson sat on her lap.

Police arrested Carol Fedigan after the tragic accident Saturday night at Sammamish Lake, Washington, outside Seattle when they came to suspect she was driving under the influence.

Ms Fedigan's husband, David Walker, 70, was inside the house when she smashed through the living room. He was killed.

Her daughter Megan Berry and son-in-law Sean Berry were on the back porch. They were were run over by the speeding car and are currently in critical condition at Harborview Medical Center.

The SUV came to a stop with its back wheels caught on the porch and its front end dangling in the lake.

The toddler was not hurt - nor was Ms Fedigan.

Police, however, suspect alcohol or drugs are a factor.

She is charged with one count of vehicular homicide and two counts of vehicular assault.

Police drew blood from her and are awaiting the results of a toxicology test, which could take several weeks to come back.

Authorities will also examine the car to determine whether there was a mechanical malfunction that caused the acceleration.

'It's just sad you know. To kill your husband, tough. Itâ€™s tough,' neighbor Will Pickering told KIRO.
