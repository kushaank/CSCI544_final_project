A Hamden, Connecticut woman has apparently been caught in a web of lies, all of which just backfired on her.

Danielle Shea, 22, was arrested, accused of calling in a bomb threat during Quinnipiac University's commencement.

Police say she was trying to keep her family from learning that she wasn't graduating.

It turns out, Shea didn't attend the university at all this year despite the fact that her mother paid thousands of dollars, thinking it was going to her daughter's education.

At the time of her arrest, she was wearing a cap and gown she had purchased.
