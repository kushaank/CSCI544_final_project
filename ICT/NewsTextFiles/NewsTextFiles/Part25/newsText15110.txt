
A Springfield man was charged this afternoon with second-degree robbery and first-degree burglary for allegedly robbing a 22-year-old man on a Lane Transit District bus at knifepoint, police said.

Angel Gamaliel Gallo, 19,  boarded a bus at 11th Avenue and Patterson Street on Thursday at 5:45 p.m. when he allegedly demanded the victim give him his jewelry, police spokeswoman Melinda McLaughlin said.

The victim called police soon after the incident, McLaughlin said. Police arrested Gallo on Friday and were able to recover the stolen jewelry, which the victim said had sentimental value, she said.

Gallo is being held in the Lane County Jail.
