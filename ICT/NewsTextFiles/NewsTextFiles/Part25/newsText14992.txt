
NORTH COTABATO, Philippines – Policemen on Sunday arrested in separate operations three  leaders of a group selling shabu in the province.

Combined operatives of the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group, and the Midsayap municipal police, led by Supt. Reinante Delos Santos, first arrested Tontoh Usman, a Maguindanaon who is wanted for drug offenses.

Usman was arrested in his hideout in Barangay Malinao in Midsayap with information coming from his relatives and barangay officials.

Investigators found in Usman’s lair drug sniffing paraphernalia, shabu, a fragmentation grenade, and ammunition for handguns and assault rifles.

Witnesses said three of Usman’s followers managed to run away and pour out “crystalline substance” on a ditch from the shoulder bags each of them carried as they escaped.

Usman is tagged as leader of the biggest drug trafficking syndicate in the first district of the province.

Several hours later, policemen arrested in nearby Libungan town, also in North Cotabato, Mimungka Panggalan, and his younger sibling, Tatah, both henchmen of Usman.

The Palangalans were nabbed inside their house by members of the Libungan police led by Chief Inspector Bernard Tayong.

Tayong and his men recovered shabu, a 12-gauge shotgun and .45 caliber pistol from the suspects.
