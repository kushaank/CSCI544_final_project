
PANCHKULA: Armed with a country-made pistol, a gas cutter and oxygen and LPG cylinders, a mechanical engineer, a former photo journalist and an auto-rickshaw driver hit the road on a three-wheeler, hoping to steal cash out of ATMs after tasting success just once out of a string of failed attempts. Instead, they landed behind bars even before they could employ their wares.

The police on Monday arrested Manjeet Singh , 22, a mechanical engineer from Bihar residing in Viragi Mohalla, Pinjore, Hargyan Singh, 40, a former photo journalist and a resident of Pinjore, and Mohammed Nazim, 21, a resident of Saini Mohalla, during a routine naka. Their interrogation revealed the three were behind the spurt in ATMs being targeted in Pinjore, Baddi and Chandimandir.

Pinjore station house officer  Lalit Kumar said, "They are professional thieves as they had all the equipment to break an ATM. Manjeet is the mastermind. He learnt the technique of cutting the machine from websites. Nazim and Manjeet are neighbours."

The first attempt was made in Chandimandir on the intervening night of February 5. The accused, however, could not dismantle the ATM. All of them were caught on CCTV cameras but were wearing masks. On February 16, the three lifted an ATM of Punjab National Bank in Baddi having around Rs 12 lakh. They then struck on April 10, the day Lok Sabha elections were held in Haryana. The three tried their luck in Pinjore, but could not pocket any cash.

ACP Purnima Singh said, "It is an important breakthrough as we are expecting to get leads for other cases. We have taken their two days remand and will try to get all the details from them."

According to police, Hargyan Singh had worked as a  photojournalist in a vernacular newspaper in Uttar Pradesh and shifted to Panchkula in 2009.

Another success the three had in their new trade was the oxygen cylinder that they had stolen it from General Hospital, Sector 6, around 10 days ago.
