
CLINTON — Two men — one of them wearing a bulletproof vest — were arrested Sunday after a report of a burglary in progress at Southern Coal Co. on Airbase Lane in Briceville.

A security guard for the business chased the two suspects, who fled into nearby woods after they were confronted, Anderson County Sheriff’s Department Chief Deputy Mark Lucas stated in a news release.

Deputies found the suspects after a search. Arrested and charged with burglary, theft and criminal trespassing were Louis Edward Goodman, 24, of Oak Ridge, and 24-year-old Christopher Houston Harness of Briceville.

Goodman was also charged with unlawful use of body armor because he had on a bulletproof vest at the time, while Harness was charged with possession of burglary tools.

Both suspects remained in the Anderson County Jail on Monday.
