
Queensland's police minister says not one recreational motorcyclist has been charged under the state's bikie crackdown.

Police Minister Jack Dempsey has told parliament that everyone arrested under Operation Resolute was linked to a criminal gang.

"We've seen 946 criminal motorcycle gang members - for the sake of the opposition, not one recreational rider - and their associates, charged with 2274 offences," he said.

Operation Resolute was established in September last year after a brawl outside a Gold Coast restaurant prompted Bandidos bikies to storm the Southport police station.

Mr Dempsey said police shut down a large criminal operation on Monday night.
