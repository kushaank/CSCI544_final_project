
Vallejo police were led on two different pursuits Saturday night and early Sunday, the latter ending in an arrest.

The first chase began at about 9:05 p.m. when officers tried to pull over a vehicle for a traffic violation on Webb Street at Miller Avenue.

However, the suspect vehicle failed to yield and led the officers in a pursuit toward eastbound Interstate 80, where the vehicle traveled against traffic, police said.

The California Highway Patrol was requested for assistance, but the suspect vehicle was not located.

No one was injured in the incident, police added.

About five hours later, Vallejo police received a call from the CHP about a gold Infinity that had been leading CHP officers on a pursuit that began near the toll plaza on Interstate 80.

The suspect then exited the highway on to city streets where Vallejo police took over the high-speed chase, police said.

Officers performed a PIT maneuver to disable the vehicle in the 1300 block of Ensign Avenue, and deployed the Taser as the driver attempted to flee on foot, police added.

Arrested was Melvin Washington, 25, who also had an arrest warrant out of Sacramento, according to police.
