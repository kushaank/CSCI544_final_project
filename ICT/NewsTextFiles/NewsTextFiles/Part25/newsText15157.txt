
New Haven police are investigating a shooting that happened shortly after 9 p.m. on Saturday.

Officers were dispatched to the area of 52 Oak St. to investigate a shooting. According to police, when they arrived they found 26-year-old Lamar Swint, of West Haven, suffering from a gunshot wound.

Swint was suffering from a single gunshot wound to his upper right thigh. He told police that he was in his car when an unknown man opened up the car door and shot him once.

The shooting took place as a party was happening inside of the house.

Neighbors tell Eyewitness News that a cookout was being held at the house and it was filled with kids and adults.

"Everyone was screaming, there was almost 50 people back there, everyone was screaming and running, and in the back there are woods and the kid ran back there, and the other kid was on the floor bleeding," said Briana Epada.

Swint was alert and conscious at the scene. He was taken by ambulance to Yale-New Haven Hospital where he is being treated for a non-life-threatening injury.

Swint was unable to provide a detailed description of the suspect other than that it was a black male who stands between 5'08" and 6'00" tall, according to police.

This shooting is still under investigation.
