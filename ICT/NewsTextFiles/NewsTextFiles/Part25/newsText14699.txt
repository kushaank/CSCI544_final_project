
WANTED: Police are trying to find this man after an armed robbery in Sunnynook.

Auckland police want to find a good samaritan who helped try to chase down a man who robbed a Sunnynook bank armed with a nailgun.

A man entered Kiwibank on Sunnynook Rd just after 1pm on May 14 and pointed a nailgun at a teller and demanded money.

He fled with a sum of money but a bank staff member gave chase and flagged down a car in nearby Cockayne Cres.

The driver picked up the worker and they tried to follow the man, but lost sight of him.

A few minutes later the pair saw a similar-looking man getting into a car.

No-one was injured.

Police want to talk to the good samaritan who helped the bank staff member.

They are also trying to locate the armed man, who is described as Maori or Pacific Islander in his 20s or 30s.

He was wearing black wrap-around sunglasses, a black hoodie, black sleeveless puffer vest, dark pants and black sneakers with white trim.

Contact the North Shore Police on  213 7922 or call Crimestoppers 0800 555 111.
