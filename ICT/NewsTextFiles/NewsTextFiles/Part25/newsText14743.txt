
A 19-year-old British woman was injured when caught in a trap gun at Wilgamuwa yesterday, police said.

She suffered several injuries on her leg and was admitted to the Mahiyanganaya Hospital.

I am amazed, the British tourists still keep coming.

Mate British people love our country. They should be united and reject both Conservatives and Labour as the 2 parties are controlled by the Tamil Diaspora.

Hazards faced by tourists: molestation, rapes, murders and now trap guns. Still we are aiming at doubling the tourist arrivals.
