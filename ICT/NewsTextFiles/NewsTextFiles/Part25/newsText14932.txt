
BELGRADE, Serbia (May 19, 2014) Serbian authorities ordered the urgent evacuation of a town where soldiers, police and volunteers were working feverishly Monday to contain the raging Sava River before it could inundate Serbia's main power plant.

The coal-fired Nikola Tesla power plant, which supplies electricity for half of Serbia and most of Belgrade, is in the flood-hit town of Obrenovac, 16 miles upstream from the capital.

Serbian police chief Nebojsa Stefanovic ordered the town evacuated of civilians Monday because of an expected surge from the Sava.

Serbia and Bosnia are struggling with the worst flooding in southeastern Europe in more than a century.

At least 35 people have died in five days of flooding caused by torrential rain.
