
Allow us to put in a good word for old white men.

When a week or so later Donald Sterling, owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, was caught saying a lot of equally dumb racist stuff, a lot of folks chalked it up to “old white man” talk.

And it happened again this week when Robert Copeland, an 82-year-old police commissioner in a small New England town, used the N-word to describe President Barack Obama.

We beg to disagree. A bigot is a bigot, and his age is little — very little — excuse.

These guys may be old codgers, but they didn’t grow up in the antebellum South. They grew up in an America that was changing by the decade, even by the day, moving fitfully to a broader acceptance of civil rights and human liberties. They may be creaky old men now, but they were young men or mere children when Martin Luther King Jr. marched.

If Robert Kennedy were alive today, he would be an old white man. So would Studs Terkel.

When today’s old bigots were young, they failed to listen, failed to learn.

Take heed, children.
