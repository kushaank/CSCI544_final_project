This year's Documentary Edge Festival opens with Erebus: Operation Overdue, an account of the New Zealand police recovery operation at the site of the 1979 Air New Zealand DC-10 crash in Antarctica and a new examination look at what went wrong on the flight which killed 237 passengers and 20 crew.

The film, funded by New Zealand On Air's Platinum Fund, is due to screen later in the year on TVNZ.

It has its world premiere at the festival's opening event at Auckland's Q Theatre on Wednesday evening.

The festival programme says: "This film tells the story of four New Zealand police officers who went to Antarctica as part of the police operation to recover the victims of the crash.

"For the first time, an Air New Zealand senior staff member provides the inside story of the airline that was accused of one of the largest corporate cover-ups in New Zealand's history.

"Set in the beautiful yet hostile environment of Antarctica, this is the emotional and compelling true story of an extraordinary police operation."

The Erebus scenes were filmed at the Roundhill skifield near Lake Tekapo.
