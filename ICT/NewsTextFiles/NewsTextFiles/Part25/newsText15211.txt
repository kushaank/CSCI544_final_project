
Labour leader Ed Miliband today set out plans to link the National Minimum Wage to average earnings in an attempt to win over voters before thursday's European and local elections.

Speaking on the Today programme he said: "The minimum wage has done a good job in tackling the worst of exploitation but we have now got to tackle low pay."

She said: "The simplicity of the national minimum wage is one of its strengths, but ultimately pay must reflect productivity. Every business should pay the national minimum wage, so we support better enforcement.

The minimum wage will increase by 19p an hour to Â£6.50 from October.
