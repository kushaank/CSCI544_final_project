
Michael Moore, 21, pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery, two counts of robbery, tampering with evidence, receiving stolen property and obstructing official business.

A sentencing date has not been set yet pending a pre-sentence investigation report.

At 11 p.m., the delivery man arrived at 240 Fourth St. when he was approached by two men, according to Elyria police Lt. William Pelko.

The victim said that one of them hit him in the head with the butt of the gun and then went rummaging through his pockets and taking an undisclosed amount of money, his cellphone, wallet and pizza order.

Once police arrived on the scene, there was a brief foot chase, and officers arrested Moore and Andre Hopper, 21, of Elyria. The men were spotted lying on the ground in the backyard of a Fifth Street home, Pelko said.
