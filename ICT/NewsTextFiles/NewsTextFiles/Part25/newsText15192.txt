
JOHANNESBURG - The Madibeng local municipality said it will set up a multi-party task team to further investigate allegations that a councillor and three other people manipulated water supply in Mothutlung , in order to benefit from a tender to provide water tankers to the area.

Earlier this year four people died allegedly at the hands of police during a week-long protest over water shortages in the North West township.

Spokesperson for the Madibeng local municipality Lebogang Tsogang said one councillor was implicated in the scandal and will face criminal charges.
