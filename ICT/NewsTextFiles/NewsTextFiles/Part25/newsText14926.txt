COLUMBIA, Md. (WUSA9) - The skateboarding and snowboarding store in Columbia Mall where a gunman killed two employees before fatally shooting himself reopened Monday morning after being completely remodeled.

Two employees at Zumiez, 21-year-old Brianna Benlolo and 25-year-old Tyler Johnson, were killed Jan. 25.  Police say 19-year-old Darion Aguilar shot the two workers and then turned the gun on himself.

"After consulting with our employees and the victims' families, we decided to completely remodel and reopen the store. We all continue to keep the victims and their families in our hearts and, together, remember and honor them in many ways. The remodeled store quietly recognizes Brianna and Tyler with two simple tiles that bear their initials: "B" and "T".

Tuesday, some members of the media will be able to view the remodeled store.
