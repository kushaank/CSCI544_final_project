
Ahead of the 2015 general elections, Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, hasÂ  reaffirmed his commitment to ensuring that Enugu North senatorial zone produced the next governor of Enugu state in the spirit of justice, equity and fairness.

The assurance which came at the weekend during a cultural night organised by the people of Nsukka zone under the auspices of Nsukka Zonal Forum in honour of the lawmaker at the University of Nigeria Nsukka (UNN) finally laid to rest insinuations in some quarters that Ekweremadu was nursing gubernatorial ambition.

He rather pledged his preparedness to work with the people of the area to realise their aspiration in 2015.
