"I'm going to shoot down the place." That's what one angry Burger King customer allegedly shouted after she was served a stale cinnamon roll in South Carolina. But the irate, threatening customer remains on the loose.

The suspect was eating at the Mount Pleasant, S.C., location with two friends recently when she complained that her cinnamon bun wasn't fresh, the Post and Courier reported. She became angry and started shouting, but stormed out when a manager tried to speak to her, a witness told police according to a report by the New York Daily News.

But the incident wasn't over. The bad taste of that stale bun must have lingered because the three friends came back later, and the woman threatened to shoot the restaurant's employees and patrons, police said.

According to the police report, the irate woman said, "I'm going to shoot down the place."

She left again, along with her friends, when employees called police. Police said they have not found the suspect, and no one has been arrested.
