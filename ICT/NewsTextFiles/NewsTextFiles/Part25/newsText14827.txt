TEHRAN – Iranian actress Leila Hatami on Sunday angered authorities in Tehran by greeting the president of the Cannes film festival with a kiss on the cheek, an act that outraged conservatives back home.

Hatami gained worldwide fame for her role in Asghar Farhadi’s “A Separation,” which won the 2012 Academy Award for best foreign language film.

She lives in Iran and is on the jury this year at the annual Cannes festival in southern France.

world that the Iranian theocracy doesn’t give a damn about women’s rights – tragically most women are little more than breeding machines.  Perhaps a public stoning on her return would send a clear message to the female population that this behaviour is not acceptable..

What a world we live in!

Anybody here ever try oil trading? I’ve been trading oil and making very good money. I tried the forex and that was no good and stocks can be too volatile for my tastes but with oil trading I’m making very good trades and money. I’m using the method by Gold Trading Academy for oil trading, just Google Gold Trading Academy and you should be able to find them.
