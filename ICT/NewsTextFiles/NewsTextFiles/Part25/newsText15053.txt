
A UNIVERSITY student who skipped class for a year allegedly called in bomb threats before her graduation ceremony so her family wouldn’t discover she’d quit.

Police said Danielle Shea, 22, didn’t attend Quinnipiac University in Connecticut this year even though her mother paid thousands of dollars in tuition.

When graduation arrived on Sunday, Shea allegedly panicked when relatives didn’t see her name and tried to have the ceremony cancelled.

According to police, Shea made two calls to the university’s public safety department, stating a bomb was in the library and several were on campus.

Cops identified Shea using the telephone number she’d called from and then found her in the arena, wearing a graduation cap and gown.

The Massachusetts resident has been charged with first degree threatening and falsely reporting an incident.

Police said she gave a detailed confession.
