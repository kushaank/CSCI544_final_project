
The majority of Sudanese newspapers on Monday concentrated on reactions over the detention of Alsadig al-Mahdi.The Alyoum Altaly (Arabic) newspaper stated that the ruling National Congress Party (NCP) declared that the leader of the opposition National Umma Party (NUP), al-Mahdi, was not arrested for political or security reasons but summoned for questioning over a criminal complaint filed by the National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS).

NCP spokesperson Yasser Youssef was quoted by state media as saying that new charges were filed against al-Mahdi that would not allow him to be released by personal recognizance.

Youssef said that because of his age, status and national contributions al-Mahdi was not held in regular police docks but sent to Kober prison which he said offers better conditions until he is referred to court.

He noted that al-Mahdi repeated his allegations against the RSF, stressing that the NCP wished that things would not reach this stage.

Meanwhile The Sudan Tribune Newspaper quoted al-Mahdi’s daughter, Mariam as saying that her father went through lengthy interrogation since Sunday morning, adding that she does not know the outcome of the investigations.

She disclosed that an NUP delegation met with the head of the African Union High Level Implementation Panel (AUHIP), Thabo Mbeki, and informed him of the party’s decision to suspend participation in the national dialogue.

The Alrakoba (Arabic) newspaper quoted Al-Mahdi’s lawyer, Satie al-Hag, as revealing that his client faces charges of undermining constitutional order and using force against the regime, adding that those charges are punishable by death if convicted.

The Hurriat (Arabic) newspaper  disclosed that al-Mahdi has sent a message to his supporters from inside Kobar prison.

Al-Mahdi was questioned before state security prosecutors on Thursday regarding remarks he made accusing the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) of committing serious abuses in conflict zones in Darfur and Kordofan including rape, looting and arson on villages.
