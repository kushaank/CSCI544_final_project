
The Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand had       dropped its investigation into Alan Reay on legal advice,       chief executive Andrew Cleland said.

Dr Reay's company designed the CTV building which collapsed       during the February 22, 2011 Christchurch earthquake, killing       115 people.

Dr Cleland said Dr Reay resigned from IPENZ on February 28,       but remains a chartered professional engineer.

IPENZ has authority to take action only over engineers who       are IPENZ members.

‘‘After taking legal advice, IPENZ concluded the       investigations could no longer proceed," Dr Cleland said.

He said the families of those killed in the building collapse       had been informed.

Police announced in February that engineering firm Beca had       been engaged to review information on the collapse of the CTV       Building to see whether any criminal investigations should be       undertaken.
