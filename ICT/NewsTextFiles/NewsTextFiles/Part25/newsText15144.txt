
SELBYVILLE â€” Delaware State Police have identified the Bishopville, Md., couple in the investigation of a suspected murder-suicide.

The bodies of Edward Watkins Sr., 63, and his wife Robin Watkins, 53, were both discovered in a parking lot behind Bayview Estates clubhouse Sunday morning.

They resided in the Maryland side of the Bayview Estates community, in Bishopville, state police spokesman Cpl. John Day said.

A preliminary investigation indicates the couple drove separately to the clubhouse sometime during the late evening of Sunday, May 18.

Authorities believe Mr. Watkins shot his wife twice and then shot himself. A handgun was recovered at the scene.

Both bodies were turned over to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for an official determination of the cause and manner of death.

State Police troopers responded to the clubhouse on Sea Gull Road at about 5:50 a.m. after receiving a report of two people lying on the ground in the rear parking lot. Troopers arrived to find an unresponsive male and female lying near two vehicles. Both were pronounced dead at the scene.
