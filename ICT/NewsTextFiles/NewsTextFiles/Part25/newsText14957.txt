
After Leila Hatami, who is serving on the Cannes jury, greeted festival head Gilles Jacob in the customary French way, a government leader condemned her for demonstrating a "bad image of Iranian women to the world."

Iranian actress Leila Hatami, co-star of Asghar Farhadi's 2011 Oscar winner A Separation, has become the target of outrage in her home country, after photos surfaced of her greeting Cannes Film Festival head Gilles Jacob with a kiss on the cheek, as is the French custom.

Hatami is serving as a jury member at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. After catching wind of the kiss, the Islamic republic's deputy culture minister, Hossein Noushabadi, accused her of maligning Iranians -- especially Iranian women -- with her actions and presence at the festival.
