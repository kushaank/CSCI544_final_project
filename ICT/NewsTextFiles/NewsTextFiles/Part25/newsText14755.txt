
A 14-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of arson after a fire involving eight tall conifer trees in Telford.

The teenager was arrested by police after the blaze in the trees in Park Lane, Woodside, which were in a wooded area close to the community centre and doctor's surgery.

The blaze broke out at about 4pm on Sunday, with Shropshire Fire & Rescue reporting "a large number of calls" from concerned residents.

Stuart Parker, who lives opposite the trees, described it as a "massive" fire.

He said: "Ash was in the air - scary. I had to close all the windows and doors.

"Only one or two trees were aflame, and it could have been a lot worse than it was. No clue if the fire was accidental or not.

"There was a crowd of people outside my apartment and so much noise."

West Mercia Police Inspector Mark Reilly said: "A young 14-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of arson. He has not yet been charged with any offence.

"Local residents have come forward to offer help to police in identifying the youth and have said they will provide statements.

"No one was injured and the fire service had everything under control quickly."

Fire fighters from Telford Central used an extended hose reel jet to reach the trees and put out the fire, then remained at the scene throughout the early evening damping down the area.
