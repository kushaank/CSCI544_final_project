
The yacht Henri Lloyd led all participating boats into the Ken Wright Pier in Port Antonio, Portland, on Saturday, which is the 12th leg of the World Clipper racing competition.

Deputy race director of the World Clipper boat race, Mark Light, explained that the winning boat, Henri Lloyd, was ahead by 31 seconds over the second-place finisher Great Britain and Northern Island, with Switzerland finishing third.

"It was really a close finish," commented Light.

He added: "This leg was a short one and it was really a sprint from Panama to Jamaica, which lasted for three days. Henri Lloyd has won quite a few races and they are at the top of the lead right now. They have been very consistent, finishing in the top three or four on most occasions. The next leg is from Jamaica to New York."

The World Clipper yacht race started in September in London, England, with 12 competing yachts. The next leg will be from Jamaica to New York, United States, beginning May 24, with that race climaxing just outside New York Harbour.

According to Light, the weather has been sunny and beautiful thus far, which makes it almost perfect for sailing. He noted that the crew on the boats comprise a professional skipper (captain) along with an amateur crew.

The lone Jamaican entry entered Port Antonio in 10th position, despite starting well out of Panama.

Light noted that the Jamaican boat sailed east hoping to capitalise on windy conditions, which didn't pay off, thus landing them in that position.
