
SUDAN - Sudan’s state security has arrested opposition leader and ex-prime minister Sadiq al Mahdi for treason.

The move could hurt efforts to ease political tensions before elections due next year.

Al Mahdi is the head of the Umma party, the biggest opposition to current Sudan leader President Omar Hassan al-Bashir. Bashir ousted al Mahdi in a 1989 coup.

The opposition leader is being accused of insulting state security officers over violence in the troubled Darfur region.

In response his party has cancelled national dialogue talks called by Bashir.

The talks were meant to ease tensions among Sudan's political parties ahead of elections next year.

The party has called on supporters to protest against the detention.
