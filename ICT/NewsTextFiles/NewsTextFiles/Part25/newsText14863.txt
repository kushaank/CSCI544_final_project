
ST. CATHARINES - Police say officers were able to peacefully resolve a potentially volatile situation Sunday when a man armed with a large knife went to the St. Catharines station and threatened to harm himself.

On Sunday at around 6:30 p.m., a 40-year-old man went to the public reception counter at the detachment at 68 Church St. and presented himself to police employees. The man was armed with a 12-inch knife and was acting in a way suggesting he was going to injure himself.

A civilian employee was present during the initial stages, but uniform officers immediately attended the front counter and began negotiating with the man. The officers, using their crisis negotiation training, were able to convince the man to disarm himself, and he was peacefully taken into custody under the authority of the Mental Health Act.

In a news release, Niagara Regional Police chief Jeffrey McGuire said incidents such as this, though rare, do occur at police facilities.

"Our members utilized their training extremely well to respond, de-escalate, and ultimately resolve this critical incident," he said. "Our intention during matters such as this is always to resolve them as peacefully as possible, with the protection of the public, our members, and the involved person as our primary goals. All of our members responded in a highly professional manner during this stressful situation, and we are proud of them."

There were no injuries in this incident, and no members of the public were present at the time.
