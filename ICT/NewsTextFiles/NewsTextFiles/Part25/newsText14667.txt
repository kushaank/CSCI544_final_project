
IOWA CITY, Iowa  Iowa City police are investigating a fourth shooting incident in just over two months. Only one person has been confirmed injured in the shooting incidents, which police say are happening more frequently.

The most recent shots fired report came on Sunday night around 7:30. Police say they recovered multiple shell casings on Davis Street, but didn’t locate any victims. On Saturday police investigated another shooting incident at 423 Second Ave A car and home were struck by gunfire, but the incident wasn’t reported to police until 15 hours after the shots were believed to have been fired.

Police say a weekend fight among a group of teenagers may be linked to at least one of those shooting cases. Police said they have transferred a juvenile male to a detention center for possible involvement in one of the cases.

On Easter Sunday police investigated an early morning shooting at the Pheasant Ridge Apartments, 2626 Bartelt Road in Iowa City. Officials recovered roughly two dozen shell casings but did not find any victims.

In March a female was seriously injured in a shooting incident at the same apartment complex when more than a dozen shots were fired into the building. Two people have been arrested in connection with that shooting.

Lt. Mike Brotherton, head of investigations, said the incidents are alarming and he urged anyone with information to come forward.

The Iowa City Area CrimeStoppers has offered a $1000 cash reward in each of the cases for information leading to arrest(s). The Number is 319-358-TIPS (8477).
