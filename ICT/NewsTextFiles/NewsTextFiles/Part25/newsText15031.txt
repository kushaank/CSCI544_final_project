JONESBORO, AR (KAIT) – If you don't put on your seatbelt every time you get into a car, you now have another reason to buckle up.

The statewide campaign, "Click it or Ticket" kicked off on Monday.

Law Enforcement officials all across Arkansas said they are checking to see if you're buckling up this Memorial Day weekend.

"Statistics are statistics," said Arkansas State Trooper Craig Teague. "We work a lot of wrecks now that people would be okay, probably be walking around talking to us if they had their seat belt on. Unfortunately they don't in some cases. We really hate to see that and we're the ones that have to work those accidents and see that so, that's why we really want to enforce it."

Trooper Teague said the campaign hopes to bring Arkansas drivers towards zero deaths.
