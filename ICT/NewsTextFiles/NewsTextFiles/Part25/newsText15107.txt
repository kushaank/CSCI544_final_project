
The owner of a party-supplies store in East Austin was arrested last week after buying several stolen bicycles, according to an arrest affidavit.

Sergio Lejarazu, 48, owner of Jumpolin Rentals at 1401 E. Cesar Chavez St., was arrested Wednesday after police say he bought two bicycles from an informant, the document said. The informant implied each time that the bikes were stolen, it said.

Police then trailed Lejarazu to a Southeast Austin storage unit, where he was seen exchanging the bikes for cash with two men in a van. He was arrested after leaving the unit, police said.

Lejarazu was charged with a theft by appropriation and is being held at the Travis County Jail on $7,000 bail. The other two men were not shown in the Travis County Jail on Monday.
