
GILLETTE â€” A 31-year-old Gillette man accused of fatally shooting a yearling cow for its meat and then damaging a backhoe after disposing of the remains is facing additional charges of aggravated burglary and disposal of stolen property.

The Gillette News Record reported that Justin Epley had already been sentenced to six years in prison for being a felon in possession of a firearm when the cow was killed.

Prosecutors now say the guns thought to have been used in the killing, an AR-15 rifle and a .45-caliber handgun, were stolen. The weapons have not been recovered.

Authorities say Epley put the backhoe into drive and sent it into a ditch after killing the cow. The carcass and backhoe were found Sept. 4.

Investigators say Epley told a cellmate he shot the cow 54 times.
