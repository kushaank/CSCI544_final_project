
A man who bought a Taser in Thailand before trying it out on his mates at a Cairns pub has been handed a good behaviour bond.

Brendon John King, 40, told the court he picked up the device while holidaying in Thailand as a means of protection.

Police didn't see it that way, however, when they arrested Mr King outside the Courthouse Hotel on May 1, after security guards witnessed him zapping friends with the device.

Mr King's lawyer, Stephen O'Reilly told the court his client had no idea he was not allowed to wield the device in public.

"He carried it with him because he was previously assaulted and it made him feel safe," Mr O'Reilly said.

"There was no suggestion he was using the device as its intended purpose. "There was no deliberate or sinister intent."

Magistrate Suzette Coats handed Mr King a $330 good behaviour bond and said she would not record a conviction against him.
