CORNISH, Maine (NEWS CENTER) -- The third suspect wanted in connection with a home invasion in Buxton was arrested Saturday evening in Cornish.

The Buxton Police Department issued a warrant for Michael Crockett's arrest on Thursday. Crockett's attorney Amy Fairfield said he was hiding in the woods since Thursday evening. Fairfield said she convinced him to turn himself in Saturday night.

Fairfield contacted The York County Sheriff's Department and told them where Crockett was located. He walked out of the woods on Cumberland Street in Crockett and was taken into custody without incident.

Crockett's attorney told NEWS CENTER Saturday that he was not involved with the home invasion on April 11. Fairfield said Crockett was in Portland the night of the incident.

Crockett is at the York County Jail and will make his first court appearance Monday afternoon.

Buxton Police said a woman walked in on three burglars in her home on Callahan Street on April 11. The burglars then allegedly tied up the homeowner, stole money, and left the scene.  Medical officials took the homeowner to the hospital.

Police arrested Stacy Day, 35, and Gregory Hoar, 29 on May 15 in connection with the home invasion. Both were charged with one count of Class A Robbery and two counts of Class B Aggravated Assault.
