
Kiev is considering a ban on the Communist Party of Ukraine over its alleged anti-constitutional actions, authorities said Monday.

According to the presidential press service, the country's acting President Alexandr Turchynov filled a request to the Justice Ministry, asking for a probe into the possible involvement of the leadership of the Communist group in separatist movement in eastern regions.

In his request, Turchynov ordered the ministry to look into the Ukrainian Communist Party's activities, which were allegedly aimed at "violating sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and undermining its security."

Turchynov requested the ministry to find legal instruments and immediately ban the Communist Party of Ukraine if there is proof of its involvement in anti-constitutional actions.

In response to Turchynov's request, the Justice Ministry sent a letter of inquiry to the country's Prosecutor General Office and the Security Service demanding an investigation into the case.

"We are collaborating with the law enforcement agencies to collect the evidence as soon as possible," Justice Minister Pavlo Petrenko told reporters.

Once the evidence is found, the Justice Ministry would bring the case to court, Petrenko added.
