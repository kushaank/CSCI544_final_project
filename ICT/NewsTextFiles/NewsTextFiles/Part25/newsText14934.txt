
Sugar Land police say a woman was followed home from a bank in Houston Friday afternoon.

"I heard a lady scream because I live right here. So she kept screaming, 'Help me! Help me!' I didn't know what it was and I didn't want to come out because I didn't know how safe it was going to be to have a look and see what was going on," said neighbor Kayina Nongo.

She heard the woman scream when she stopped at the mailboxes at the Grants Lake Condos at about 2 p.m.

Nongo told Local 2, "Once I saw that there was a guy there, I knew there was trouble. So I ran quickly in, shut the door and I ran upstairs."

Sugar Land police say the victim got out of her car and was walking to the mailbox when she saw two men in a blue Honda Accord.Â  She said one man got out of his car, came over, forced her to the ground and stole her van.

The 43-year-old woman told investigators there was a lot of money in her van from a family business in Houston.

Police say the victim was not hurt.

Sugar Land police say she described the passenger as a black male in his 20s, clean shaven, with an average build and wearing a gray hoodie and dark sweat pants. She described the driver of the getaway car as a man with an average build who wore a hoodie.
