
The Deputy Minister of Higher Education Nandimithra Ekanayake said today that he was ready to retire from politics.

“The time has come for us to retire.  The opportunity should be given for the intellectuals and not for the dumb,” he said at a function held at the Ukuwela Divisional Secretariat.
