IONIA, Mich. (WZZM) â€“ A former Ionia County funeral home owner accused of bilking clients out of nearly $500,000 was convicted Monday of 26 felony charges, including racketeering, that could put him in prison for 20 years.

Jurors in Ionia County Circuit Court deliberated several hours before finding Marti James Schrauben guilty on all charges. Judge David Hoort revoked Schrauben's bond and ordered him jailed  pending sentencing. A sentencing date has not been set.

Schrauben, 40, was charged with 26 felonies related to the operation of Schrauben Lehman Funeral Homes in Ionia and Portland, including cashing out prepaid funeral accounts before the person had died and creating fake death certificates.

The state Attorney General's office filed criminal charges in July, 2012, alleging he embezzled nearly $500,000 from customers and insurance companies between 2008 and 2010.

Although his name is still associated with Schrauben-Lehman Funeral Homes, Schrauben sold all interest in the company and was working as an employee when the embezzlement occurred. The funeral home owner contacted police about financial irregularities, which launched the criminal investigation.

Schrauben created false death certificates and sent them to insurance companies in order to receive payment from funeral policies. He also accepted money for prepaid funerals from customers and failed to place the money in escrow accounts as required by state law.

The state Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs in March revoked Schrauben's mortuary sciences license, fined him $10,000 and ordered him to pay more than $150,000 in restitution.
