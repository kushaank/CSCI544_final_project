Georgetown, Del.

A 63-year-old Dover woman died Friday from injuries she sustained in a May 12 crash on U.S. Route 113 in Georgetown.

According to the Delaware State Police, Anezia Valette was a passenger in a 1999 Toyota Corolla driven by 37-year-old Marie Voltaire of Dover. Police said the accident occurred around 3:40 p.m. as Voltaire was driving in the right lane of U.S. Route 113 just north of Speedway Road. For an unknown reason, police said the Corolla drifted into the left lane, the left turn lane and then the grass median where it struck a fully marked DSP 2013 Chevrolet Tahoe head on.

A 31-year-old male trooper assigned to Troop 4 in Georgetown was in the Tahoe, which was parked in the center median monitoring traffic on an Office of Highway Safety sponsored seatbelt enforcement detail. No emergency equipment was activated at the time of the crash.

The trooper was transported to Beebe Medical Center where he was treated for minor injuries and released. Voltaire and Valette were transported to Nanticoke Memorial Hospital. Voltaire was admitted with non-life threatening injuries. Valette was admitted and later died. Police said occupants of both vehicles were properly restrained at the time of the crash.

Voltaire was issued a traffic summons for failing to remain in a single lane on the day of the crash.
