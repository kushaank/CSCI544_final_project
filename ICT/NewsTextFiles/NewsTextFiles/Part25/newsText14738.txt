
The foreign minister, Martin Lidegaard, and the trade and development minister, Mogens Jensen, have launched a one-year Syria program for 2014 and a strategic aid framework for Syria for 2014 and 2015.

Some 100 million kroner has been set aside for a program that the government sees as an important part of the ongoing Danish efforts to help the Syrian population in the opposition-controlled areas in the country.

“The new Syria project aims to improve the access that the Syrian population has to basic needs like water, electricity, education and health,” Jensen said in a press release.

Moreover, the aid funds will support a number of human rights and civil society projects and efforts that target a political solution to the conflict.

“With the program, we will double our stabilisation and development efforts in Syria, sending a clear signal to the Syrian population and the moderate opposition that Denmark is behind them,” Lidegaard said.

The program is to be financed by the peace and stability fund, which will give 80 million kroner, and the Danish-Arab Partnership Program, which is covering the remaining 20 million kroner.
