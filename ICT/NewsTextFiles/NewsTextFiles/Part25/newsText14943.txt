
Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) has sharply reacted to a news published on the police’s website about withdrawal of several members of the crime-bursting agency from duty.

The news published on Monday morning on ‘DMP News’, operated by Dhaka Metropolitan Police, was removed from the site following RAB reaction.

The news said 18 RAB members, including the Commander of Crime Prevention Company (CPC) of RAB-3 Major Ali Ahsan, were taken off duty over allegation of money embezzlement.

RAB, however, said they were attached to RAB headquarters, not withdrawn from duty.

There were allegations that CPC members embezzled Tk 90,000 from Tk 0.15 million that they seized from four arrestees on Friday. The four men are from Comilla.

‘DMP News’ said though the RAB members seized Tk 0.15 million, they showed only Tk 60,000 in the seizure list and embezzled the remainder.

RAB headquarters found the allegations made by the families of the arrestees genuine.

The agency’s Director General Mokhlesur Rahman admitted on Monday morning that all members of the CPC-3 were withdrawn.

But RAB sent a letter to the police protesting the news after seeing it on the DMP website.

The letter undersigned by RAB spokesperson ATM Habibur Rahman described the news as ‘motivated and false’.

It said the “shameless lie” on the official website of a government agency that is, a famed and well-reputed law-enforcing agency concerning members of another agency will not only tarnish the image of the forces, but also affect the morale and sprit of the members working in the forces.

The letter said “all have to face embarrassment” due to this sort of activities of the officers responsible.

Habibur told bdnews24.com that CPC-3 members were not withdrawn from duty; they were attached to the headquarters.
