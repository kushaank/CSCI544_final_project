
CHENNAI: Police arrested eleven DMK activists in connection with the attack on journalists in front of the party treasurer M K Stalin's house on Sunday.

Police said the arrested were produced at a local court which remanded them to 14 days judicial custody.

All the arrested were sent to Vellore prison, police said. A section of DMK activists protesting against the media coverage on the ongoings in the party allegedly assaulted some media persons yesterday in which three were injured.

The DMK camp witnessed high drama with Stalin offering to quit party posts owning moral responsibility for the party's disastrous performance in the just concluded Lok Sabha polls in which it drew a blank.

However, he did a somersault by withdrawing resignation at the directive of his father and party chief M Karunanidhi.
