
Chicago Police were questioning a person of interest Monday in the homicide investigation of a 3-year-old girl who was found dead at her Northwest Side home Sunday night.

Police were called to the girl’s home about 8:30 p.m.in the 3300 block of North Natchez Avenue, police said.

She was pronounced dead at the scene at 8:48 p.m., a spokesman for the medical examiner’s office said. Her name was being withheld Monday morning pending notification of family members.

The family of the toddler had lived in their Northwest Side apartment about three years, said their upstairs neighbor, a stay-at-home mother of three.

The mother, Anita Padilla,  said police told her the dead child’s mother had reported a break-in Sunday.

Padilla said her neighbors could be worryingly loud at times. Sometimes, their arguments were noisy enough to shake Padilla’s walls, the neighbor said.

“There was a lot of yelling, but it was mostly between the husband and wife,” Padilla said.

The arguments were in Spanish, a language Padilla says she doesn’t speak. Padilla said the arguments never resulted in a police visit.

On Sunday, the neighbors were unusually quiet, Padilla said.

“I didn’t even know they were at home,” Padilla said.

Padilla said the father of the toddler appeared to be a devoted dad.

“When he would leave every day (for work), she would stand by the window, and he would stand by the car blowing kisses and giving air hugs,” Padilla said.
