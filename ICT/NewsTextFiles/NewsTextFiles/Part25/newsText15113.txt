
SANTA ROSA (CBS SF) — A former Sebastopol Cub Scout leader pleaded not guilty Monday to seven felony charges of committing sex offenses on a child and providing obscene material.

Santa Rosa police arrested Franklin Lee, 40, on March 28 at the police station. The alleged offenses took place over three or four years until the victim, who was not a Cub Scout, was 16, police Sgt. Terry Anderson said.

The complaint alleges continuous sex abuse of a child, oral copulation with a child under 14, sodomy with a child under 16 and providing obscene material to a child.

Lee was the Cub Scout leader of Sebastopol Pack 128. Lee’s attorney Ben Adams said today the alleged offenses were not related to scouting.

Steven Dunn, district director of the Boy Scouts’ Redwood Empire Council, said Lee was immediately removed and was permanently banned from scouting when the allegations came to light.

Dunn said Boy Scout policy includes “two-deep leadership” that requires two adult leaders to be present at all scouting activities.

A preliminary hearing date for Lee will be scheduled on June 2 in Sonoma County Superior Court.
