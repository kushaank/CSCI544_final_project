
A pair of employees at a store in northwest Harris County locked themselves into a back room during a robbery late Monday that triggered a SWAT scene lasting several hours.

Harris County sheriff's deputies said two masked men stormed the Dollar General along Kuykendahl near Ella about 9:45 p.m. Monday as the manager was locking the front door.

"They came in and demanded money," Deputy Thomas Gilliland said.

Deputies said two employees ran toward the back during the holdup. One of the robbers fired in their direction but they weren't hit.

They locked themselves in a back room at the store while the robbery continued.

The robbers couldn't open the counter register or a cash drawer in the office. They took a wallet and a cell phone from a customer. Deputies said it was all they got away with.

Somebody in the store hit a panic alarm, triggering a police response. Harris County SWAT officers arrived and set up a perimeter.

They were in contact with the two store workers locked in the back room.

"We had communications with them. We asked them not to come out and stay where they were," Gilliland said.

The deputies went inside about 12:30 a.m. and made an aisle-by-aisle sweep through the store. The robbers were gone, however.

The employees were checked out by paramedics but had no apparent injuries.

Deputies did not have a detailed description of the armed robbers. Crime scene specialists are examining the store for any clues to help them with the investigation.
