
The deputy head of research at the Ministry of Education says the ministry is looking at incorporating "the Citizens' Rights Charter into school texts" for the coming academic year.

ISNA quotes Bahram Mohammadian as saying there will be changes in school texts in the elementary grades and the Citizens' Rights Charter will be incorporated into sociology studies.

Iranian President Hassan Rohani had said at the beginning of the school year that students have to know how to defend their rights and protest against any violations. "I believe the right to protest is where human dignity begins to flourish and it must begin in our schools," Rohani was quoted as saying. "This is what will move the society toward lawfulness."

On the 100th day of his presidency, Rohani published a first draft of a Citizens' Rights Charter and invited public input on ways to improve it.
