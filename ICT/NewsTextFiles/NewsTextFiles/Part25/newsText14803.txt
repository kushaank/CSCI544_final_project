On the last day of his imprisonment term, Venezuelan Diego Rugeri was today arraigned in court after the Italian authorities requested his extradition from Malta.

The 38-year old, who holds Venezuelan and Italian passports,Â  was born in Barinas, Venezuela but resides at Trapani, Italy. On 28 February he was imprisoned for four months after being convicted of being in possession of counterfeit travelling documents. The term lapsed today.

However, the police received a European Arrest Warrant (EAW) calling for the detention and subsequent surrender of Rugeri to the Italian Authorities. The EAW, signed by an Inquiring Magistrate from the Court of Trapani, was received through the Schengen Information System.

The Maltese Attorney General validated the EAW on 15 May. Rugeri is wanted over charges of breaching bail conditions. He pleaded not guilty to the allegations tabled by the Italian court.

Magistrate Doreen Clarke remanded Diego Rugeri in custody until the court hears evidence in his extradition request.

Lawyer Steve Tonna Lowel appeared for Rugeri.
