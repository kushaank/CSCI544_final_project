
Brantford police are praising a citizen for helping recover a sport vehicle through twitter.

At about 11:30 a.m. Friday, police reported to the community through local media releases and twitter that a GMC Jimmy was stolen between midnight and 7:30 a.m.

Shortly after noon, police say a watchful resident who follows the city police twitter feed read about the theft. The resident, who is not identified, recalled seeing a similar type vehicle parked near his residence the previous evening.

He immediately alerted police who attended to investigate.

The vehicle observed by the citizen proved to be the stolen Jimmy.

In a prepared statement, police praised the citizen for his co-operation.
