
CAIRO, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Gunmen shot dead two Egyptian policemen on Monday in Minya province, 220 km south of the capital Cairo, as they were heading home, the interior ministry said in a statement.

The militants intercepted and opened fire randomly at the policemen who were on a motorbike, the statement added.

Since the ouster of Islamist President Mohamed Morsi by the army last July, a wave of militant attacks and explosions targeting security personnel and their premises have risen mainly in the restive Sinai Peninsula. But recently, the attacks have crept into the capital and Delta cities.

A recent government report said the death toll from such attacks reached nearly 500. Most of the victims were soldiers and policemen.
