
Family and friends gather to remember teens who drowned in Kwitzil Lake near Prince George, B.C.

Kendall Moore was 17, her boyfriend Craig Wood, 19.

Police say the lake, which is also known as Gravel Pit Lake, was the site of a huge party attended by hundreds of teens.

Friends of Moore and Wood have said on social media that others jumped in to the lake to try to rescue them.

Striemer said Moore was an amazing person, fun to be around, who loved horses and dressing up in cowboy boots.

Striemer said friends of both teenagers have been visiting the lake all day.

Teens who were at the party say there was drinking going on, but won't say if that included Moore and Wood, or whether it had a role in the accident.
