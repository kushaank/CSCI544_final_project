
A 25-year-old man is facing a series of charges after two women were assaulted in a Dartmouth home and one was then taken to Preston where the violence continued.

Halifax Regional Police say the domestic-related assault began around 5 a.m. Sunday at a residence in the 400 block of Portland Hills Drive.

One of the women was later taken against her will to Upper Partridge River Road in Preston. Police say the assault continued there.

Police say they subsequently arrested a suspect. The man is accused of break and enter, kidnapping, forcible confinement and assault causing bodily harm.

Both women were treated and released from hospital. Their injuries are not life-threatening.

The suspect is being held in custody and is due to appear in court on Tuesday.
