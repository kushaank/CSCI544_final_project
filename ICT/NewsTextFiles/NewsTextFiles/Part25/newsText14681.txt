
When a Nampa, Idaho man got dressed Sunday morning, he probably didn't think his t-shirt choice would end up being immortalized in his mugshot. But, there's 35-year old Ricky Fisher under arrest with the words "It's all fun and games until the cops show up" printed across his chest.

Fisher and 19-year old Jennifer Balfe from Meridian were arrested Sunday. Lewiston Police had received information that a couple suspected of robbing the Cottonwood Bank were staying at the Cedars Inn. The police department staged the SWAT team outside the motel.

At about 11:00 Sunday morning, the suspects came out of their room and were confronted by police. They were taken into custody and transported to the Lewiston Police Department for questioning. Lewiston Police say Fisher and Balfe are also suspected of robbing two banks in Ontario, Oregon as well.

Cottonwood Police and the FBI are overseeing the investigation.
