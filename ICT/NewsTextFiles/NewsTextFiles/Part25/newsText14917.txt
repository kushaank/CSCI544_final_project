
Baringo, Kenya: Police have launched investigations into the over 6,000 cartridges and 181 live bullets impounded at Mogotio in Baringo County.

Detectives are holding a man found with the suspicious cargo which were hidden inside sacks containing charcoal.

Police said the 45-year-old man arrested with the 6,300 bullet cartridges and 181 live bullets had claimed he got them from Kenya Defence Forces training grounds in Loruk and was ferrying them to Nakuru for smelting to make door locks.

Â “We cannot believe what the arrested man is saying. He says he got the ammo from the KDF, but who gave them to him?” posed Mogotio District Criminal Investigations Officer (DCIO) Josphat Wahinya.

Wahinya said the live ammunition could kill even without bullet heads and they were treating the matter with seriousness it deserves.

“Up to now we are still grilling the suspect and we are sure we will soon get to the bottom of the matter,” he said, adding that the 7.62mm-catridges haul could have been destined to a town beyond Nakuru.

Wahinya told The Standard in his office at Mogotio Police Station that they suspected the two bags of charcoal in which the bullets and cartridges were hidden originated in Marigat.

“Police intercepted the 6,340 used bullets and 181 live after tip off by the public who had boarded the matatu in which the suspect was travelling from Marigat to Nakuru and we arrested him and is in our custody,” said Wahinya.

The DCIO added that they were investigating if there was a link between the cargo and the rampant cattle rustling in Baringo County.

Â “We are yet to really ascertain the motive of transporting the bullets and their destination,” he said.
