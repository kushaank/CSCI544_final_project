ARARAT - Police officers from across the Western Region - Division 4 attended the bi annual compstat forum at Ararat in May.

This forum discusses and evaluates police performances around a number of measures including crime reduction, road trauma reduction, member safety and community satisfaction results.

The Northern Grampians Police Service Area (PSA) forms part of the forum with police from Stawell, Ararat and surrounding areas.

A panel of representatives from Victoria Police Command chair the forum.

Northern Grampians PSA, Local Area Commander Inspector Wayne Barclay said historically the Northern Grampians PSA performs well and indications from the latest meeting were that it continues to do so.

"It is fair to say the Northern Grampians police were acknowledged for their very good levels of customer satisfaction," he said.

"It was also recognised for the number of local initiatives arising from within the PSA aimed at achieving progress in each of the areas.

"The division was also complimented for its continued efforts in reducing road trauma and efforts around crime prevention and detection.

"There is ongoing confidence in the good relationship police in this PSA have with their community, which is very refreshing."

Insp Barclay said the PSA's focus remains around further reducing road trauma, improved levels of family violence intervention and maximising the use of intelligence in addressing crime prevention issues.
