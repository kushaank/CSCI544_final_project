
BURNS HARBOR | A truck driver was taken to the hospital after an accident Monday morning on Interstate 94 at U.S. 20.

Indiana State Police said the semi driver took a ramp too fast, causing his load to shift.

The accident and cleanup blocked the ramp for about four hours.

Police said the semi pulling a box trailer, driven by Donald Bell, 60, of Belleville, Mich., was traveling too fast when he took the ramp from eastbound I-94 to westbound U.S. 20.

The truck was hauling crates of 6-inch round pieces of steel, which shifted when Bell took the curve too fast, police said.

Firefighters from Burns Harbor had to cut the top of the semi tractor off to get Bell out. Bell was taken to Porter Regional Hospital in Valparaiso with non-life threatening injuries.

Bell was cited for traveling too fast to avoid a collision, police said.
