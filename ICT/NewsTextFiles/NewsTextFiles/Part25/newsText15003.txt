
Nigel Farage today hit back in the racism row engulfing his party - by claiming Romanians are responsible for 92 per cent of ATM crime in London.

The Ukip leader took out a full-page advertisement in today's Daily Telegraph to defend his controversial remarks that people should be concerned if Romanians moved in next door to them.

Mr Farage later blamed the remarks on his tiredness at the time of a grilling on LBC Radio which was ultimately cut short by the party's spin chief.

In the advertisement taken out today, Mr Farage said the comments had led to a "predictable storm of protest and accusations of racism."

After highlighting Romania's problems with poverty since the fall of communism, an open letter from Mr Farage continues: "The other huge problem in Romania has been the growth of organised criminal gangs for whom EU membership has meant greater opportunities."

Citing an interview given to ITV's Fraud Squad programme in 2012, the advert claims 92 per cent of all ATM crime in London is committed by Romanians.

It also says 28,000 Romanians were arrested in the last five years "in the Metropolitan Police area alone."

"We should not be in a political union with Romania, with an open door to all of their citizens," the advert says. "We must take back the power to stop criminals from entering our country by taking back control of our borders.

"It is not racist to want to stop organised criminal gangs undermining out way of life - it is common sense," the message concludes.

The bottom of the advert carries the message "all we want is our country back" and features a photograph of Ukip supporters, including several from ethnic minorities as the party tries to dispel a reputation for racism.
