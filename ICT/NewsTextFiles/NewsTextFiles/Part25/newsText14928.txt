
IT was the New Year's Eve high jinks Jason James Mordey might rather forget.

The 37-year-old has been sentenced after he was caught drink driving on three wheels just hours after the year ticked over to 2014, The Daily Mercury reports.

Mordey drove his car more than 4km without the front right tyre to a house onÂ  Kookaburra Street, where police tried to apprehend him after a series of Triple-0 calls from neighbours who had seen the car on three wheels.

Then it got weird.

First , Mr Mordey refused to allow police into his home without a warrant.

After they did go in, Mordey was sculling a two-litre bottle of milk, which he continued to drink after police told him to stop.

When they got him to the watchhouse, police say Mordey went straight to a tap and began drinking water, again despite officers warning him not to.

He still recorded a blood-alcohol reading of 0.129.
