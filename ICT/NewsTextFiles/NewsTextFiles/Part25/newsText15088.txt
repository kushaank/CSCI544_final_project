
WALKER, Mich. (May 18, 2014) – The family of Yolanda Reyes is grieving while police search to find who killed the West Michigan mother of four.

The body believed to be that of Reyes, 40, was found partially buried under dirt on Friday at a construction site near Bristol Ridge Condominiums.

That’s not far from where her husband says he dropped her off at Neal Mast & Son Greenhouses on April 24.  She never reported for her shift.

Police say they’re investigating Reyes’ death as a homicide in every way, but there have been no arrests.

Reyes’ family is having a very hard time with the loss.  They’re hoping to get more answers on how she died Monday.

Her children say she was a loving mother, always putting them first.

“I love and miss her,” Royner Rodas, Reyes’ son, said.

Police say they are questioning known acquaintances and family members, and are still awaiting dental records to positively identify Reyes.  They are hoping for that positive identification in the coming week.

K-9 Units were out searching for clues on Sunday at the site where her body was found.

Walker Police are asking for help finding Reyes’ killer. Anyone with information should call them at 616-791-6800.
