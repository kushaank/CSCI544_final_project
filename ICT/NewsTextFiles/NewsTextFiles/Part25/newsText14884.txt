
The Ramgarh and Bokaro police along with the CRPF has continued its “cordon and search” operation in the dense forest of Gola and its neighbouring area following an encounter with Maoists at Barkajara forest in Ramgarh on Sunday.

The security forces have intensified the search operation in order to nab an ultra who was apparently injured in the encounter. The police suspect that several ultras were hit during the encounter and some of them are getting treatment under village level doctors.

Superintendent of police (SP) Ramgarh Ranjit Prasad said, “Intensive combing operation is going on in several areas of Ramgarh, Ranchi and Bokaro districts including Kasmar, Silli and Angada. We have used bikes to speed up the operation”.

However, nonetheless the dense forest has made the task of the security forces more challenging. The Maosists had laid landmines in the forest but the police managed to defuse them and continued their operation. Security forces recovered four landmines, detonators and few string bombs in the forest on Sunday. Sources informed that commanders of the ultras from Bokaro, Giridih and other areas including Ajay Mahto, Santosh Mahto and Rammohan were supposed to attend a meeting in Gola but their plan was foiled by the police.

Koyalchal DIG Deo Bihari Sharma said, “The police of several districts are keeping a close watch on the area for the past several days following reports of Maoist movement.” The spot of the encounter lies on a “Maoist-corridor” connecting the Saranda forest to the Parasnath hills in the state.
