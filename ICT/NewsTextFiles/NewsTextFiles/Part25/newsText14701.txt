
An 18-year-old man is expected at the Montreal courthouse Monday to face charges after police found 19 homemade explosive devices in his family’s Ahuntsic-Cartierville home.

It was a person close to the suspect who notified police about the presence of explosive materials in the family's triplex.

Specialists with the Montreal police used a bomb-defusing robot in the 15-hour operation, during which a number of homes had to be evacuated.

The suspect is accused of having explosive materials in his possession.
