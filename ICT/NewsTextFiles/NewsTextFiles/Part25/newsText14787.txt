
A  hazardous materials team was called to scene of an unattended death inside a south Boulder condo Monday, after officers found the materials for extracting hash oil inside the residence.

Foul play is not suspected in the death, according to police.

Police and fire crews were dispatched just before 3 p.m. Monday to 4102 Greenbriar Blvd., across from Fairview High School, on a report that a man's body had been discovered inside the residence.

A hazmat team also was called to the scene after responding officers saw the materials used for making hash oil from dried marijuana, Boulder police Sgt. David Spraggs said.

Hash oil extraction  typically involves the use of  butane or other flammable gases.

The team performed a sweep of the residence before detectives or officials from the Boulder County Coroner's Office entered the premises, Spraggs said.

"They were called in to do some air monitoring and make sure the scene was safe," Spraggs said.

Investigators say the death does not appear to have occurred under suspicious circumstances.

"There's no early indication that foul play was involved," Spraggs said.

Police said the deceased person was an adult male but declined to comment further on his death.

The coroner's office will release the man's identity once next of kin have been notified.
