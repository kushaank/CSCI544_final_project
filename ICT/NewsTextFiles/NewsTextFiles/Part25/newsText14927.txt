A baby critically injured in a King Country crash is believed to have been sitting unrestrained on the mother's lap, police say.

There were four adults, the baby aged under one and a three-year-old sibling in the small hatchback car which crashed into a bank about 8.30am on State Highway 4 near Kopaki, north of Taumarunui, District Road Policing Manager Inspector Freda Grace said.

It appears the driver lost control on a 65km/h bend.

Five of the people were properly restraints, but the baby was believed to have been sitting in the mother's lap with tragic consequences when the crash happened, Insp Grace said.

"Unrestrained, the baby has been thrown into the rear interior of the car and suffered critical injuries."

The baby was flown to Starship Hospital in Auckland by helicopter, but the flight had been delayed for some time due to bad weather, she said.

An ambulance took the mother and three-year-old to Waikato Hospital with moderate injuries. The others were treated at the scene, Insp Grace said.

Police were investigating if the car's two bald front tyres contributed to the driver losing control on the downhill stretch of road.

"It may be that the speed was too fast for the conditions and the condition of the tyres contributed to what happened."

Motorists needed to ensure their vehicles were roadworthy at all time and passengers correctly restrained, she said.
