
Updated at 6:55 p.m. by Claire Cardona Dallas police have determined that a man in his 50s died after being accidentally run over by a Frito-Lay delivery truck.

The driver of the truck parked in the rear of the Wal-Mart in Pleasant Grove and went inside the store. While he was inside, a man either sat or lay underneath the truck, police said. The driver returned to the vehicle, sat for a moment and then drove off with the man still under the truck. The driver ran over the man, killing him, police said.

After realizing what happened, the driver stopped and remained at the scene. The incident was captured on store surveillance footage.

Update at 3:58 p.m.: According to our media partners at NBC DFW, it now appears the person might have been struck by a Frito-Lay delivery truck.

Original item posted at 3:27 p.m.: Dallas police are trying to determine what, or who, killed a person found along the 2800 block of South Buckner Boulevard on Monday afternoon.

According to a police spokeswoman, around 2:30 p.m. Dallas Fire-Rescue workers were called to the alley behind the Walmart Neighborhood Market near Buckner and Scyene. They were told there was an “unconscious person” behind the store, says DPD.

But a few minutes later, paramedics requested Dallas police. It’s not yet clear why: Initially police believed there might be signs of what officers call “homicidal violence,” but now officers are trying to determine whether the victim was struck by a car. Traffic investigators are currently on the scene.
