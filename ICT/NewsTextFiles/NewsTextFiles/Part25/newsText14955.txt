A 52-year-old Lithuanian woman today died while on a diving expedition in Cirkewwa. The incident happened at around 2 pm.

However, a police spokesperson told MaltaToday that it was not yet clear whether the diver, who was in Malta on holiday, died before immersion or straight after immersion.

Although the police are still waiting for the autopsy results, it seems that the diver died of natural causes.
