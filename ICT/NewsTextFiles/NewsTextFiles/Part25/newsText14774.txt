
Sugarcreek Twp. police confirm they are investigating allegations of sexting involving middle school and high school students in Bellbrook.

According to the police department, the investigation began in January. The number of students suspected to be involved has grown to 17.

Monday, Sgt. Mark White said, "There are quite a lot of players and how many tentacles it goes from that remains to be seen."

Charges are coming, he said, that include pandering obscenity and disseminating information harmful to juveniles.

The police department indicated that the pictures involve nude juveniles believed to be in middle and high school.

Superintendent Keith St. Pierre acknowledged that the police department is looking into the allegations. He said the events allegedly happened outside of school and those events have nothing to do with the school district.

White said no arrests have been made, but noted this "will continue to be investigated for a long time."
