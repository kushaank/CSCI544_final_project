
Speaking in a meeting with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Arab and African Affairs Hossein Amir Abdollahian in Tehran on Saturday, French Foreign Ministry’s Director for North Africa and Middle-East affairs Jean-François Girault said Tehran and Paris should continue consultations over Syria and other Middle-Eastern countries, adding that terrorist groups operating in Syria pose threats to France and Europe.

Amir Abdollahian, for his part, warned of the dangerous consequences of the spread of terrorism and extremism in the Middle-East.

Earlier this month, Franc's anti-terror police arrested six French people suspected of going to join jihadist fighters in Syria.

Armed officers made the arrests in raids in the Eastern city of Strasbourg.

Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said the raid demonstrated "the government's absolute determination to fight with all its force against terrorism and the indoctrination of young people".

Cazeneuve said earlier this month that 285 French citizens were fighting in Syria, despite a slew of measures to prevent people from travelling to the war-torn country.

There have been mounting concerns in France over the number of young jihadists heading to fight in Syria, with authorities fearing they could pose a major security threat if they return home as battle-hardened veterans.

Europe1 radio said 14 would-be jihadists had travelled to Syria from Strasbourg after telling their families they were going to Dubai on holiday.
