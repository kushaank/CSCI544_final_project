
A senior inspector from the UN atomic agency is due to arrive in Tehran to hold talks about the countryâ€™s nuclear energy program, an Iranian official says.

â€œDeputy Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Tero Varjoranta, will come to Iran on Monday at the head of a delegation to negotiate with the officials of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) within the framework of cooperation between Iran and the agency to remove certain outstanding concerns and ambiguities,â€� spokesman for the AEOI Behrouz Kamalvandi said.

He added that the day-long â€œtechnical and expertâ€� negotiations between Iran and IAEA team will start on Tuesday with the purpose of rounding off the 13 measures that Iran has taken in cooperation with the IAEA in various ways.

â€œIn line with cooperation [with the IAEA], Iran has in two phases conducted measures over the past six months to remove certain questions and ambiguities of the Agency,â€� Kamalvandi said.

He added that the measures included six cases in the first phase and seven others in the second stage.

â€œThese measures were taken in various forms such as the exchange of information verbally, in writing and managed visits [to Iranian nuclear sites] and in some cases the Agency had requested additional information, which it was given,â€� Kamalvandi said.

â€œWe are now at a stage where the Agency should as soon as possible report its assessment of the measures taken [by Iran] so that the path for future [Iran-IAEA] cooperation is smoothed out,â€� he added.

Iran and the IAEA signed a joint statement last November to outline a roadmap for mutual cooperation on certain outstanding nuclear issues.

The UN nuclear agencyâ€™s visit to Iran will come as Tehran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany wrapped up their latest round of negotiations in the Austrian capital of Vienna on Friday with no tangible progress on drafting the text of a comprehensive agreement.
