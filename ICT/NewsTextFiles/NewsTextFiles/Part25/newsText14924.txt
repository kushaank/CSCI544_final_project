
Two women have been found dead inside a home in Edwards, police said.

Chief Lewis Johnson said he believes both were natural deaths, but he couldn't immediately say how the women died.

A 91-year-old woman and her 47-year-old granddaughter lived at the home, Johnson said.

Police broke into the home in the 400 block of Jackson Street about 1:30 p.m. Monday after a yard care worker noticed that the grass was really high and the cars were there, Johnson said. After the man called the house several times and got no answer, he called police, the chief said.

Gus Lloyd, a relative, said the deaths happened less than a week after his mother passed away.

"I'm trying to be strong -- at least that's the last thing I heard from my mom, was to be strong. But I had no idea this was going to come the second week behind her," Lloyd said. "I'm just trying to do what I have to do."

Police don't believe foul play was involved.
