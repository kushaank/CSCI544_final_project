
Deputy Police Commissioner-General Pol Gen Worapong Chiewpreecha has instructed police to step up security of residences of caretaker ministers.

The security has been heightened for the ministers after the People's Democratic Reform Committee vowed to dispatch protesters to hound them to pressure them to resign.

Worapong also recruited provincial police from provinces that are strongholds of the Pheu Thai to form teams to try to arrest 30 leaders of the People's Democratic Reform Committee, who are now wanted by arrest warrants.
