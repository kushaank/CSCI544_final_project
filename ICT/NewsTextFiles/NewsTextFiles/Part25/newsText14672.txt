
Two participants of Sunday’s action of protest near the Russian Embassy in Yerevan were detained by police, activists reported.

Armen Urikhanyan and Varuzhan Tribunyan were released later that day after a protocol was drawn up about their detention.

Both activists were among several dozen protesters who marched to the Russian Embassy with banners “No to Putinism”, demanding that Russia respect Armenia’s sovereignty.

In a letter submitted to the Embassy the protest participants also expressed their negative attitude towards Ambassador Ivan Volnynkin’s recent statements. In one of such statements the Russian diplomat called for new methods to be used to deal with non-governmental organizations seeking to “drive a wedge” in Armenian-Russian relations.

Participants of the protest met by a police cordon at the Embassy building also carried flags of Armenia and the European Union. They stressed that they saw Armenia’s future with “democratic Europe” rather than “dictatorial Russia”.

The detentions took place towards the end of the protest during which a scuffle occurred between some protesters and police officers.
