Mayor Nutter revealed the the City's plan to replace the former corruption-laden Traffic Court. Last year, several traffic court judges and businessmen were caught in a ticket-fixing scheme. As a result, the Pennsylvania Supreme court voted to fold Traffic Court into Municipal Court. Today, authorities announced that the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office will now handle all traffic cases. A team of 4 assistant district attorneys and 10 paralegals will process 500 cases a day. This is a change from the old system where police officers often acted as prosecutor and witness in the case. Philadelphia Common Pleas Court judge Gary glazer was appointed by the PA Supreme Court to oversee this change. A budget of $800,000 will have to fit into the city's budget.
