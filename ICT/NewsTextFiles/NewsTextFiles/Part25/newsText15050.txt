San Antonio police are investigating a deadly shooting on the city's east side.

Investigators said a 6-year-old girl was shot in the face when a loaded handgun went off.

According to the Bexar County Medical Examiner's office, she has been identified as Jennilynn Montana.

The accident happened at a house in the 1400 block of Aransas Avenue around 9:45p.m. Sunday.

Police said the girl was rushed to San Antonio Military Medical Center, where she died.

Police on the scene said the girl was playing in a room alone, but they are testing the victim's 8-year-old sister for gun residue because it's not clear whether she may have been in the room, as well.

Authorities did not say whether the girl's parents were likely to be charged in the accidental shooting.
