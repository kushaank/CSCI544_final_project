
(Updated 3 p.m.) PRESIDENT ROXAS, Cotabato – Three suspected New People's Army rebels were killed following a foiled attack on the municipal police station here early morning Tuesday, officials said.

Senior Inspector Bernabe Rubio said at least 80 rebels staged the attack around 3:30 a.m. but were repulsed by policemen on duty at the time.

“We are only 15 on duty at the time but because we wanted to defend our police station, we fought them and exchanged fire with them for almost 15 minutes,” Rubio told GMA News Online.

The attack damaged the glass door of the police office and created holes on its concrete walling, Rubio said.

Col. Nilo Vinluan, commander of the 57th Infantry Battalion, identified two of the rebel fatalities as Commander Rebo and Commander Toto Gamay. The third rebel fatality was not immediately identified.
