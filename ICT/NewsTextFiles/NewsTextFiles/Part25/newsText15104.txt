AMHERST – Police arrested a New Hampshire mother Sunday afternoon for operating under the influence after they got a call from someone concerned seeing her driving a car with a child and another adult inside.

Police were called to Colonial Village apartments but then found the suspect at Spirit Haus. Police arrested Liberty J. Lynn, 34, of Merrimack, N.H. on operating under the influence, second offense and resisting arrest after she struggled with officers when they attempted to put her in the cruiser, police said.

She was also charged with operating a moving vehicle with negligent endangerment, child endangerment while under the influence and possession of a class B drug, a pharmaceutical.

She had been visiting friends at Colonial Village where she once lived, police said.

 She was transported to the Hampshire County Jail and House of Correction Sunday evening and was scheduled to be arraigned in Eastern Hampshire District Court in Belchertown Monday morning.

Lynn's eight-year-old child was initially released into the custody of a friend but the State Department of Children and Families was called in later in the day, police said.
