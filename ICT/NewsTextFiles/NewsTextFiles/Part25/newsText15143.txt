A man was hit and killed by a train near the North Lafayette Street bridge in Shelby on Monday, according to Shelby Police Department.

“As of 9:30 a.m. we had a pedestrian hit at the North Lafyette Street Bridge,” Shelby Police Chief Jeff Ledford said.

A white male identified as James Phillip Bell, 51, of Mooresboro, was hit by a CSX empty coal train headed west. Police believe that the Bell was near the bridge when he was struck and then drug about 200 yards west with the train.

Police were uncertain as to how Bell was struck and what might have happened.

“It is still early in the investigation,” Ledford said. "We are still interviewing the few witnesses that we have."

As of 12:30 p.m. Monday, police were still investigating, and CSX had brought in a team to investigate as well.

North Washington and Lafyette streets from Seaboard to Grover streets were blocked several hours by the stopped train and emergency vehicles.

People need to remember not to walk on tracks and to be careful while crossing tracks, he added.

Police continue to investigate what happened to Bell.
