
Patricia Franklin Bell, 26, was the mother of a 3-year-old boy and worked as a security officer at Denver's Stapleton International Airport. She also may have been a prostitute. Bell moved into the home of  Frank Churchill, 88, on Clarkson Street. On the morning of March 25, 1976,  a co-worker of Bell's who was concerned about her welfare went to the home and found Bell and Churchill dead of multiple stab wounds. An autopsy report showed that Bell had been stabbed or cut more than 100 times. Ned Lottie, a convicted felon who described himself as Bell's boyfriend, went on trial for the murders, but the jury was deadlocked and the judge declared a mistrial. Denver Post reporter Kirk Mitchell is compiling unsolved murder cases online, and sometimes all that is needed to reignite an investigation is a single, pivotal clue.
