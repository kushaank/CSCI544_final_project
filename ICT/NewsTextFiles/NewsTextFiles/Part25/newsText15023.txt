The location in South Linden has a notorious history as the former site of Windsor Terrace, a housing project overrun by gangs in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Rosewind rose from the rubble of the demolished Windsor Terrace in the late 1990s.

A charcoal grill sits on the patio of 1352 Terrace Lane, with a can of lighter fluid beside it and a DirectTV satellite dish just around the corner. The grass is cut, the bushes are trimmed, and lampposts line the sidewalks and streets through the quiet complex. The only evidence of crime is the yellow police tape circling the yard.

A neighbor who lives across Terrace Lane from the scene of Saturday’s shooting said she was shocked. The neighbor, who didn’t want to give her name, said the south end of the complex was peaceful.

“That doesn’t happen over here,” she said.

Yvonne Weaver, who lives near the scene of the shooting, is a member of Rosewind’s resident council. She said a number of the neighbors, mostly young mothers, approached her, saying they were scared.
