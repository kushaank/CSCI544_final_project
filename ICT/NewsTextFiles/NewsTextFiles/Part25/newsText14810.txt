
A deputy head teacher from Cardiff who secretly filmed pupils going to the toilet has been jailed for five years.

Gareth Williams, 47, had admitted 31 charges including nine of voyeurism and 20 of making indecent photos.

He was caught following a global operation targeting users of a child abuse website and police found 691 videos of a voyeuristic nature.

His wife Georgina said after the hearing she was sickened by his actions.
