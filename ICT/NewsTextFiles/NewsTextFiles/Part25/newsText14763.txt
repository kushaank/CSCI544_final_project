
There was drama in Karagita estate in Naivasha after area residents held a demonstration to protest the blocking of a corridor leading to Lake Naivasha. At one time, the over 400 residents blocked the busy Moi South Lake road forcing anti-riot police officers to intervene during the Sunday morning incident.

At one time, the irate residents clashed with the police before demolishing a perimeter wall that had blocked the corridor. Trouble started on Saturday night when the developer blocked the corridor was incidentally opened by a parliamentary committee last month.

The residents however woke up to find that the developer had blocked it leading to the morning chaos. A senior officer at the CID headquarters was accused by the demonstrators of trying to influence the closure of the road. According to David Kilo from the Lake Naivasha boat owners association, the developer had hired youths to block the road.

He said that the blocked section was marked as corridor and wondered why the developer had blocked it. “Parliament ordered that the road be opened up and we were surprised when the developer decided to block it,” he said. Kilo put on notice other developers who had blocked other corridors around the lake adding that their days were numbered as locals would soon open them up.

He pointed to a corridor leading to the Central landing beach which was recently blocked affecting tens of students, traders and government officers. “We are asking the parliamentary committee to revisit this issue as some developers are oppressing the poor,” he said.
