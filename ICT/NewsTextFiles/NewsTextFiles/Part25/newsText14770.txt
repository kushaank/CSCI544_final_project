
A POLICE station is throwing open its doors to give people an insight into the day-to-day lives of police officers.

Police staff will be on hand to guide visitors through the different aspects of policing at an open event at Darlington police station, in St Cuthberts Way, this weekend.

Visitors to the recently refurbished station will be able to view the cells and follow the journey of an arrested person, from being brought into custody, through to being charged or released.

Staff will demonstrate forensic examinations, including fingerprinting, how a prisoner is interviewed and how officers deal with a violent offender.

There will also be a crash simulator, as well as a traffic car and officers from the dog section.

Information on the Special Constabulary, Police Cadets, Alcohol Harm Reduction Unit and Neighbourhood Watch will also be on offer.

Police and Crime Commissioner for County Durham, Ron Hogg, will be live-tweeting the event as well as hosting an online Police and Communities Together (Pact) meeting from 2pm to 3pm on the Darlington Neighbourhood Police Team Facebook page.

Inspector Mick Button, of Darlington’s neighbourhood policing team, said: “The event is to promote the fact that we have spent money refurbishing the police station rather than knocking it down to build a new one and we have made some big improvements.

Tea and coffee will also be available.

The open days take place on Saturday and Sunday (May 24 and 25) from10.30am to 4.30pm and tours of the station take about an hour.
