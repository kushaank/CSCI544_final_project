
A prisoner who stabbed a man to death after escaping jail has been arrested after absconding again while on day release.

Merseyside Police said Arnold Pickering, 44, was detained by officers from Greater Manchester Police at around 11.45am today.

He had failed to return to HMP Kennet in Maghull, Merseyside, after leaving the Category C jail at about 9.30am on Saturday.

It was believed he and another prisoner, Thomas Moffet, 51, were in the Stockport area.

In 1990 he stabbed a man to death in Oldham while he was on the run from Strangeways prison in Manchester.

He was jailed for a minimum of 18 years for that crime.

And in 2009 Pickering also absconded from HMP Kirkham while on a day release program that allowed him to work on the bins in Manchester city centre.

Moffet, who was serving an indeterminate sentence for several robberies, was also arrested after failing to return.

A Merseyside Police spokesman said: ‘Both prisoners were due back at around 4.30pm yesterday but failed to return and this was reported to Merseyside Police at around 7pm.

‘Since then, officers have been carrying out extensive inquiries and working with partner agencies and other forces to locate them and return them to prison.
