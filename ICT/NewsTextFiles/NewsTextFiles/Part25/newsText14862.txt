
About 17 months ago, Trooper Orlando Mo met Mary Sherlach 's family under the worst imaginable circumstances, just a few hours after she had been murdered along with 20 children and five other staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown.

But on Saturday, the 32-year State Police veteran had an opportunity to join the family on a more joyous occasion -- the graduation of Sherlach's daughter, Katy Sherlach, from the doctoral program at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.

"It brought tears to my eyes to watch her cross the stage. I wondered what her mom would say," Mo said Sunday, emotion apparent in his voice as he recalled the ceremony. "You want to speak for her, but you don't want to spoil the moment."

In the wake of the Sandy Hook tragedy, Mo, 58, was one of the troopers and local police officers assigned as liaisons to the families of the 26 victims.

Over the next months, Mo and the other liaisons spent countless hours with the families, providing updates about the case, screening visitors, keeping the flood of media at bay and helping provide emotional support.
