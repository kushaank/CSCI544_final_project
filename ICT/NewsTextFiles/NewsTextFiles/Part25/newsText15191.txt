
Shehr, Yemen - Gunmen killed two soldiers in an ambush on an army patrol in south-eastern Yemen on Monday, a security official said.

“Unknown gunmen opened fire at a military vehicle killing two soldiers,” the source said. The attack took place at the entrance to Shehr, a coastal town in Hadramawt province.

The assailants fled, he said.

The ambush coincided with an army operation launched April 29 against suspected al-Qaeda militants, centred on Abyan and Shabwa in the south and the central province of Baida.

But al-Qaeda is also firmly implanted in other regions, including Hadramawt.

Its Yemeni franchise, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, took advantage of a 2011 uprising that ousted veteran president Ali Abdullah Saleh to seize large swathes of the south and east.
