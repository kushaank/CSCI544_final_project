
NEWTON (AP) â€” A Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority bus crashed through a guardrail and fencing on an overpass Sunday, leaving the front of the vehicle hanging over the Massachusetts Pike. Eight people were injured, including the bus operator.

Transit police Lt. Detective Mark Gillespie told the Boston Herald that the bus left the Watertown MBTA yard at 7:20 a.m. About 15 minutes later, while headed to Kenmore Station, the bus steered off the road in Newton, climbed onto a sidewalk and smashed into a guardrail, he said.

Seven passengers and the bus driver were transported to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, MBTA spokeswoman Kelly Smith told The Associated Press. Three other passengers declined medical treatment.

The bus was removed from its perch over the Pike in Newton late Sunday morning.

State police had said the bus was never in danger of falling onto the Pike because the Newton Fire Department had secured it.

Transit police detectives are investigating the cause of the crash. The bus will be impounded and thoroughly inspected, Gillespie said.

The right lane on Interstate 90 was closed because of falling debris following the crash. The Exit 17 on-ramp was also closed.
