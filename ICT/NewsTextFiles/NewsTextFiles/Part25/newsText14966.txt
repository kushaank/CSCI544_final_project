
A marijuana trafficking moggy has Dunedin police baffled, after it hauled home a five-gram bag of cannabis.

A Dunedin woman phoned police on Sunday evening to say her cat had brought home a "bag of drugs",Â Sergeant Reece Munro told the Otago Daily Times.

"You hear of cats bringing dead birds and rats home, but I've never seen anything like this before," he told the newspaper.

Investigations into the haul, worth about $100, were continuing.

As for the cat, there was no news on whether it had abandoned cat nip hits for cannabis.
