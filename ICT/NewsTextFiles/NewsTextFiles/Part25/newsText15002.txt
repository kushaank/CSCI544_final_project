
Police say they've recovered a credit card-skimming device from a Metro-North ticket machine at Grand Central Terminal, the latest in a series of investigations into the information-stealing equipment targeting public transit customers.

An MTA maintenance employee found the skimming device in a Metro-North ticket machine at around noon on May 12, and investigators determined it had been installed at 6 a.m. that day. Because none of the information had yet been downloaded, no one was victimized, authorities said.

TD Bank customers on Long Island are being urged to check their accounts after an ATM skimming machine was found at the Plainview branch. Greg Cergol reports.

Officials said this particular skimming device appeared to be more sophisticated and natural-looking than ones found in the past: it was made of metal, like the real card slots on the ticket machines, and was slimmer in shape.

The MTA says a skimming device was discovered at a MetroCard vending machine at the Columbus Circle subway station, and is urging customers to check their banking and credit card statements to make sure they haven't been targeted by thieves. Michael George reports.
