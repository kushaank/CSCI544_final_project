
The Brownsville Police Department is joining forces with the Texas Department of Transportation and law enforcement agencies across the state to ticket drivers who aren’t wearing seat belts.

From today until June 1, Brownsville police officers will be out in force actively pulling over unbuckled motorists.

“With the Memorial Day holiday and the summer driving season on the horizon, it’s more important than ever for motorists to be aware of the importance of roadway safety,” Brownsville police spokesman J.J. Treviño said in a news release.

The campaign is sponsored by TxDOT and it’s in its 13th year.

In a news release TxDOT said when the campaign started in 2002, only 76 percent of motorists buckled up and today nine out of 10 Texas motorists wear their seat belts.

Texas is a leader in seat belt safety with a 94 percent compliance rate, according to TxDOT. However, teens, passengers, pickup drivers and drivers in rural areas continue to lag behind when it comes to seat belt use, according to TxDOT.

Officials said a properly fastened safety belt is the best way to avoid death or serious injury in a vehicle crash. Lap belts should fit snugly across the hips, not over the stomach. Shoulder belts go over the shoulder and across the center of the chest.

Both drivers and passengers can be ticketed if they aren’t buckled up, and violations can result in fines and court costs of up to $200. Children younger than 17 years old must be properly restrained with a safety belt or age-appropriate child passenger safety seat.
