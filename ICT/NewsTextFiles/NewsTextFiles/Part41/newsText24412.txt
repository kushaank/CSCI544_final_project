
A referendum on defence funding in Switzerland has halted the procurement process for 22 Gripen E fighter jets. Saab will continue with plans to supply 60 Gripen E fighter jets to Sweden.

In anticipation of the CHF 3.126 billion program, Saab setup 500 contracts with 125 Swiss businesses. Saab has said “contracts placed will be honoured, subject to their terms and conditions”.

Gripen is currently used by Sweden, South Africa, Czech Republic, Hungary and Thailand. In addition, The Empire Test Pilot School (ETPS) in the UK uses Gripen in its training programme for future test pilots.
