
Retailers nationwide announced this week the creation of the Retail Cyber Intelligence Sharing Center to share information about threats among merchants and with government agencies in order to keep an eye on the problems.

â€œWe have seen a sharp increase in the number of malicious actors attempting to access personal information or compromise the systems we all rely on, in the retail industry and elsewhere ,â€� Phyllis Schneck , deputy under secretary for cybersecurity and communications at the Department of Homeland Security National Protection and Programs Directorate, said in a statement.

The sharing center, which is part of the Retail Industry Leaders Association , will work to identify threats, share tactics for dealing with threats, train retailers how to protect themselves and research future threats.

More than 50 retailers helped to develop the system, including Loweâ€™s, Nike and Target .
