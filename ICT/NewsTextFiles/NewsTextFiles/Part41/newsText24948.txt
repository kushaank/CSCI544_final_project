
Search engine giant Google has created an interactive doodle which lets Internet users play a virtual    Rubik's cube on its home page today to celebrate    the 40th anniversary of the famous puzzle.

The doodle works by clicking on the cube on home page, which enlarges it,    allowing you to click and drag outside the cube to rotate it or click and    drag inside the cube to twist the different rows.

The cube was invented by Erno Rubik in the spring of 1974 in his hometown of    Budapest, Hungary.

He originally intended to create a working model to help students understand    3D geometry, but in the process created the world's best selling toy.

At the height of its popularity in the mid-1980s it was estimated that one    fifth of the world's population had played with the puzzle.
