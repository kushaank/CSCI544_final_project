
PRAGUE, May 19 (Reuters) - Flooding in the Balkans pushed Serbian day ahead power higher on Monday while low levels of wind generation supported central European prices, traders said.

Czech and Slovak electricity for Tuesday rose 6 percent to 39.67 euros ($54.37)per megawatt hour with Hungary trading at a premium to its central European neighbours at 43.16 euros.

The worst Balkan floods in more than a century continued to limit energy production in Serbia where day ahead prices traded about 1.5 euros above those in Hungary, traders said.

Utilities in Bosnia and Macedonia said they would supply 180 megawatts and 80 MW, respectively, of power to Serbia's EPS which has seen output reduced 40 percent due to the floods.

"Serbian spot prices have increased because of flooding." one trader in the region said. "Currently they are trading 1.5 euros above the Hungarian over-the-counter spot price."
