Ever notice how at a large event â€” say, during, the Mumford and Sons concert in St. Augustine â€” it becomes impossibly slow to send a text or upload a photo to social media?  That's because of spectrum crunch.

â€œFloridians are especially mobile and enthusiastic users of 4G LTE â€“ sharing photos and video, downloading large files, and staying connected to enjoy a great wireless experience,â€� said Mariano Legaz, Florida region president.

Verizon 4G LTE technology covers 99.8 percent of the stateâ€™s population.
