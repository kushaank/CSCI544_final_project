
Iggy Azalea and Ariana Grande perform onstage during the 2014 Billboard Music Awards at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on May 18, 2014 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Up and comers Iggy Azalea and Ariana Grande made a solid pitch for why they'll be sticking around for some time at the Billboard Music Awards Sunday in Las Vegas.

After the 20-year-old Grande debuted "Problem" at the Disney Music Awards on April 27, the song rocketed to No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, dated May 17. That was thanks in part to one of the biggest sales starts ever, selling 438,000 downloads in its first week â€” the fourth-biggest start for a song by a female artist.

The track is the first single off Grande's upcoming second album, due out in the fall. In addition to performing at the BBMAs, Grande is a finalist for the Top New Artist award.

Azalea's "Fancy," featuring Charli XCX, currently stands at No. 3 on the Hot 100. With "Problem at No. 4, Azalea is the first female rapper ever to have two songs concurrently in the top five of the Hot 100 chart.
