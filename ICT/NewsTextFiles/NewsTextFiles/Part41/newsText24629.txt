
Credit Suisse has finally managed to settle a longstanding Justice Department probe into help the Swiss bank provided to Americans trying to hide money behind Switzerland’s strict bank secrecy laws. The $2.6 billion agreement is far bigger than what was once anticipated—and more than twice the $780 million paid by domestic rival UBS to resolve the same issue—and has stirred some speculation about CEO Brady Dougan’s job security. Here are five ways the bank is impacted.

Credit Suisse ended up having to make things right with multiple regulators, not just the Justice Department, which opened its probe back in 2011. While the bulk of the $2.6 billion goes to the Justice Department, some goes to the Federal Reserve while the rest goes to the New York State Department of Financial Services. Credit Suisse has already set aside some $800 million for the settlement, and it’s created a sort of “bad bank” within its private banking business so it can segregate additional related legal costs from the results of its main businesses.
