
A couple of Chinese government officials have received criminal charges from the U.S. Justice Department because of using cyber espionage to steal the United Statesâ€™ trade secrets.

This is the first time in history when the United States has accused a state actor of hacking.

Monday, May 19, Eric Holder, the Attorney General, will offer the media more information about the charges.

The U.S. officials mentioned that the charges were brought against various individuals employed by the Chinese government. They also added that these persons used intelligence and military facilities to cyber-spy against several American companies.

The names of these organizations were not offered yet, but the officials mentioned that they are from the manufacturing and energy sectors.

The Obama administration believes that China is one of the most aggressive nations when it comes to spying and obtaining industrial secrets.

In 2013, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and various other U.S. newspapers reported that Chinese individuals hacked their newsroom computer systems.
