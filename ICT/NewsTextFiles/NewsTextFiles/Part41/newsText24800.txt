
Apple has selected Innolux as its third supplier of displays for the 4.7-inch iPhone 6, reports Taiwan's Economic Daily News.

It's believed that Apple has already partnered with LG Display and Japan Display for 4.7-inch panels; however, due to anticipated demand the company searched for a third supplier. Previous reports had Sharp pegged as the third supplier; however, the Economic Daily News says that Innolux Display may be Apple's choice.

Samsung, Sharp, and Innolux were reportedly in the running. Samsung is said to have been rejected to reduce Apple's reliance on the company. Sharp's sample display panels allegedly suffered from 'moire' issues and thus Innolux was chosen as the third manufacturer.

Apple is rumored to be releasing the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 as early as August 2014 . Please follow iClarified on Twitter , Facebook , Google+ , or RSS for updates.
