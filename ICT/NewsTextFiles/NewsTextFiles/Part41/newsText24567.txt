
FRANKFURT, May 19 (Reuters) - European spot power prices on Monday rose in response to plant capacity going off line and little wind power supply, while rising temperatures kept demand in check.

The German baseload power contract for Tuesday delivery  gained 1.70 euros from the price paid for Monday to 39.60 euros ($54.3) per megawatt hour, while the equivalent French contract moved up 1.20 euros to 36 euros.

Germany's big Grafenrheinfeld and Emsland nuclear reactors closed for maintenance over the weekend while RWE brought the Gundremmingen B plant back to the power grid after work there was completed.

In thermal plant outages, EnBW has taken the Karlsruhe block 8 coal plant of 838 MW off line until mid-June and E.ON has sizeable gas and capacity out at Irsching, Franken and Scholven.
