
Forty years ago, an architecture professor in Budapest created the popular puzzle, a plastic cube composed of rows that rotate independently of each other. First marketed in Hungary under the thoroughly forgettable name of “Magic Cube,” the puzzle was renamed for its inventor, Erno Rubik , when it hit the international market in 1980.

Google’s doodle, perched above the search bar, works like the real thing. Your cursor can either rotate the entire cube or move one row of colored tiles at a time. There’s also a series of keyboard shortcuts – listed here — to move the rows. As always, the goal is to arrange like-colored tiles on the same side of the cube. For those who actually know what they’re doing, the doodle keeps track of the number of moves you’ve made.

It’s every bit as engrossing as the original. Consider yourself warned.
