
In line with the Restructuring Plan Air Malta currently operates with a fleet of 10 aircraft, 6 Airbus A320 and 4 Airbus A319.

Air Malta has signed an agreement to lease out an Airbus A320 aircraft to Monarch Airlines for a period of 19 months.

The contract with the privately-owned British airline commenced at the end of April 2014 and will end in the beginning of November 2015.

Air Malta’s Chief Commercial Officer Philip Saunders was very positive about working with another EU-based airline. “The leasing section has been very active over the past couple of months. We made sure we secured two aircraft leases in line with the EU-approved restructuring plan,” said Mr Saunders.

Meanwhile, Air Malta has just taken re-delivery of one Airbus A320 aircraft at the end of its lease with Interjet of Mexico. This aircraft, which had an Interjet livery, was repainted in the first Air Malta livery as part of the airline’s celebrations of its 40th anniversary since the start of its flying operations.
