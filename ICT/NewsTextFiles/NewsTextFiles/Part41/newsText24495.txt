
TEHRAN (FNA)- Malian Prime Minister Moussa Mara declared his government is now "at war" with Tuareg rebels after Saturday's deadly clashes between the army and the separatists left 36 people dead.

Mara has also sent in troops to retake the town of Kidal from the rebels who have reportedly seized 28 civil servants, Euronews reported.

"This violence is a declaration of war and cannot be viewed differently. The Republic of Mali is henceforth at war and we will make the appropriate response to the situation," Mara noted.

Mara had been making his first visit to the North since his appointment last month as part of an effort to revive talks with the armed groups.

The rebels said they were holding the hostages because the government had failed to live up to its commitment to move towards peace talks.
