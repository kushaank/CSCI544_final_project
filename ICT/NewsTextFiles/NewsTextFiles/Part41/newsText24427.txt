
Russia’s decision to withdraw its troops away from Ukraine border caused confusion among Slovyansk terrorists, military expert Dmytro Tumchuk told journalists in Kyiv May 19.

The reason for the concern is that the extremists have failed to ship the bodies of hundreds of Russia militants out of Donbas – to avoid post-mortem examinations in Ukraine which can identify the dead as Ukrainian or Russian terrorists, LigaBiznesInform says.

Meanwhile, Slovyansk terrorists are spreading rumors that the bodies are of pro-Ukrainian police and army servicemen, Tymchuk said.

Government troops continue to build up the massive anti-terrorist operation. Since the end of previous week, they claim to have killed over 100 extremists.
