
JOHANNESBURG/LONDON (Reuters) - South African platinum miner Lonmin has lost a third of its annual production due to an industry strike over wages which its chief executive described as a "bleeding" that might lead to the company's death if not stopped in time.

South Africa's longest and costliest mining strike turned violent this month, with four miners killed as more employees tried to report for work at the world's top platinum producers.

Lonmin had anticipated a mass return of its employees to work last week, but striking members of the main Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) prevented many other workers from going back to the mines.

The strike has also hit the South African operations of Anglo American Platinum and Impala Platinum, taking out 40 percent of global production of the precious metal used for emissions-capping catalytic converters in automobiles.

"The strike has now entered its 17th week and we have now lost a third of our production for the whole year," Lonmin chief executive Ben Magara said on Monday during a briefing with journalists in Johannesburg.

â€œThe company has been bleeding and there will come a point when that bleeding means death," he later said in an interview with Reuters TV.

According to Reuters' calculations the strike has cut around 900,000 ounces of industry production to date. In Lonmin's case, it had been targeting year sales of over 750,000 ounces before the strike began, so it has lost around 250,000 ounces so far.
