
SAN FRANCISCO — Google’s YouTube has reportedly reached a US$1 billion (S$1.25 billion) deal to acquire video game streaming service Twitch, which is said to have brushed off advances from multiple other suitors.

The deal, reported by Variety, would be the biggest for YouTube since its purchase by Google in 2006 for US$1.65 billion. Twitch reportedly chose Google over multiple other offers including one from Microsoft, said sources talking to technology site the Verge.

San Francisco-based Twitch lets users stream live gameplay videos from desktop computers, as well as Microsoft Xbox One and Sony’s PlayStation 4, which both allow players to upload their own videos direct from the living room.

Launched in June 2011, Twitch has quickly become a destination for broadcasting gaming videos and popular “Let’s Play” videos, claiming more than 45 million monthly users and one million users who upload their own videos each month.

Twitch has already surpassed Facebook, Amazon and United States TV streaming service Hulu in peak traffic, said infrastructure firm DeepField. It has secured itself as the place to watch major e-sports tournaments, where video games are played competitively for cash prizes.

The start-up raised US$20 million last year from investors, including game publisher Take-Two Interactive, which publishes the Grand Theft Auto series of games, among others.

YouTube has made efforts in the past to attract game players to upload their videos to the service, introducing a new platform for gaming video streaming at the annual Game Developers Conference last year.

Google’s purchase of Twitch would enable it to tap into the rapidly rising trends of video game streaming and videos around video games, which have become a phenomenon in the last couple of years.
