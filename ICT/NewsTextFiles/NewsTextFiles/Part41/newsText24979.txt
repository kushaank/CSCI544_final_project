
NEW YORK — Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a holding in Verizon Communications in a wager that the telecommunications company will benefit after buying out its partner in the largest US wireless business.

Berkshire held 11-million Verizon shares as of March 31, Mr Buffett’s company said last Thursday. The investment is valued at about $530m.

Verizon acquired Vodafone Group’s minority stake in Verizon Wireless in February, allowing it to stop paying a dividend to its partner. The $130bn deal is a bet that there is still room for growth in the US even though a majority of customers in the country already have smartphones.

The Omaha, Nebraska-based company has forecast higher adjusted profit margins this year on a 4% increase in revenue.

"Verizon has an attractive dividend and an enviable position in the wireless market," said Roe Equity Research analyst Kevin Roe. "It’s good ballast for investors in a choppy market."

The telecommunications company is the 24th-highest payer of dividends in the Standard & Poor’s (S&P’s) 500 index, with a yield of 4.4%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The deal with Vodafone was announced last year.

Mr Buffett has long championed a concentrated approach to stock investing.

More than half of Berkshire’s $118.5bn equity portfolio at the end of March was in four companies: Wells Fargo & Company, Coca-Cola, American Express and International Business Machines Corporation.

The Verizon investment was probably taken by one of his backup stock pickers, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, based on its size, said Cook & Bynum Capital Management co-founder Richard Cook. The deputies each oversee about $7bn for Berkshire and have gotten more funds from Mr Buffett since being hired in 2010 and 2011.

Berkshire also said in the filing that its stake in General Motors declined 25% to 30-million shares. The holding of DirecTV fell to 34.5-million shares from 36.5-million three months earlier. Mr Buffett has said that both picks were made by his deputies, who outperformed the S&P 500 in 2012 and last year.

"It is very interesting to follow what Todd and Ted are doing," said Mr Cook, who manages about $310m, including Berkshire shares. "They are smart investors, and they have had some home runs already," he said.

Bringing on Mr Combs and Mr Weschler was a cornerstone of Mr Buffett’s succession plan.

The Berkshire chairman and CEO have said that they will jointly oversee all investments once he is no longer leading the business he built over the past five decades from a textile maker into one of the most-valuable companies in the world. The firm’s market capitalisation surged past $300bn this year for the first time, buoyed by gains in the stock portfolio and earnings from dozens of operating businesses.

That track record has earned Mr Buffett a following among investors, who study Berkshire’s stock picks for clues about strategy. His major equity purchases can often send a company’s shares higher. When he reported a $3.7bn stake in Exxon Mobil last November, the world’s biggest oil explorer gained 2.2% the following day and closed at its highest level in at least 33 years.

Verizon’s largest shareholders include Capital Group, manager of the American Funds mutual funds, BlackRock and Vanguard Group, each with more than 200-million shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson on Thursday disclosed a stake of 8.7-million shares.

Berkshire also boosted its stake in one of Mr Buffett’s investments, Walmart, by 17% to about 58.1-million shares, according to the filing. The holding in the Arkansas-based retailer is valued at $4.46bn, based on Thursday’s closing price of $76.83.

"In terms of what’s going to move the needle for shareholders, Mr Buffett’s very large investments still dominate" the Berkshire portfolio, said Mr Cook.
