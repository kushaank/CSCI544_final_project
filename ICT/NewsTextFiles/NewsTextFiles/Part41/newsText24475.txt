Former Virginia Sen. James H. Webb Jr. refused Monday to rule out a run for president, saying he is weighing his options.

Mr. Webb , a highly decorated Vietnam veteran who also served as secretary of the Navy under President Reagan, said he is not interested in being vice president.

“It wouldn’t be a good fit for me,” he said.

Mr. Webb climbed onto the national political stage during the 2006 election when he erased a 20-percentage-point deficit in the polls to defeat incumbent George Allen, helping Democrats capture the Senate.

During his term in office, Mr. Webb helped passed a landmark GI bill that increased education benefits to veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and raised concerns about how the United States lacks a clear articulation of its national security interests.

He did not seek re-election in 2012, choosing to step away from politics to focus on his writing.

Former Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine, a Democrat, won the seat, defeating Mr. Allen.
