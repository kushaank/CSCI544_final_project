
Tingyi Cayman Islands Holding Corp (0322), China's largest food and beverage maker by sales, reported a 22.4 percent rise in first-quarter net profit from a year back.

Lower input prices helped drive growth in instant noodle and beverage sales, it said. Net profit rose to US$128.4 million (HK$1.01 billion) from   US$104.9 million a year earlier, the Taiwan-based company said yesterday.  Tingyi, which has a broad-ranging partnership with PepsiCo, sells noodles under the Master Kong brand in China.

Net profits slumped 10.9 percent in   2013. Tingyi said revenue for the first quarter was US$2.8 billion, up 5 percent from US$2.6 billion a year ago.
