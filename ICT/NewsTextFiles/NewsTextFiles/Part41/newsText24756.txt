
Hey, Toyota, eat Tesla’s dust!

The electric-car maker added 3,000 jobs during the past year or so as it ramped up production of its Model S sedan and prepared for the release of an SUV model, building up its Californian workforce to 6,000 factory workers, engineers, and other employees. And the company is expected to add another 500 jobs in California by the end of this year.

Led by billionaire Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, Tesla is the rare company doubling down on making products in California, which has relatively high labor and energy costs and stiff environmental guidelines for laying down new plants. Texas and other states, meanwhile, are luring manufacturers with vows of lower taxes and less red tape.

Tesla is now a bigger employer than many other high-tech California companies. It has a larger workforce than San Francisco-based Twitter, which employs about 3,000 people, and it’s gaining on nearby Menlo Park-based Facebook, which has about 7,000 employees.
