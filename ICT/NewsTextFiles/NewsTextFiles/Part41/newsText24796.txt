Community Telco Australia has exchanged its Apple smartphone fleet for Samsung devices, according to the telco’s parent Bendigo and Adelaide Bank.

Also, CTA and Samsung have agreed to jointly develop mobile banking and payments services, Bendigo said.

CTA has already begun the transition from iPhone to Samsung Galaxy S5, a Bendigo spokeswoman told Computerworld Australia. She said the company switched brands to support its partner.

Under a memorandum of understanding between CTA and Samsung, CTA will gain access to Samsung technology and research while, in return, CTA will help Samsung test new products and services, the bank said.

“Our Bank has its sights firmly set on being Australia’s leading customer-connected bank, and partnerships like this will help us get there,” Bendigo and Adelaide Bank managing director Mike Hirst said in a statement.

CTA and Samsung have written a list of proposed joint projects, according to the bank. CTA plans to launch a mobile banking service called Redy in June.

In October last year, CTA CEO David Joss revealed it was [[artnid:528759|trialling Redy with two small communities in Victoria.

At the time, Redy relied on QR codes for payments, with transaction times under two seconds, Joss said. While Bendigo had chosen QR for its universality, he said the bank might review other payment technologies in the future.
