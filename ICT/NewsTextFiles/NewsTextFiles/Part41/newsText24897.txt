
Microsoft is hosting an event about its Surface tablet line in New York City tomorrow at 11am Eastern. The company is widely expected to announce some new Surface hardware, the first since the Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 were unveiled back in late September.

Current rumors suggest that we'll get a Surface Mini out of the event, a 7- or 8-inch tablet that runs Windows RT and may or may not include a digitizer pen. Anonymous sources have also whispered about a new Intel-based Surface, though whether that would be a Surface Pro 3, a larger Surface tablet, or some kind of Surface laptop is the subject of some debate. Expect any new tablets to include their own arrays of covers and accessories.

Whatever Microsoft reveals, we'll be there on the scene to cover the announcement and go hands-on with the new gadgets. Full reviews will follow as soon as we can procure hardware.
