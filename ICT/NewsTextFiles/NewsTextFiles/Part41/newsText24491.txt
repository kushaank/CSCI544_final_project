
Malian President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta will deliver a message to the nation on the situation in Kidal where shooting between loyalist forces and pro-independence rebels groups killed dozens on Saturday.President Keita is expected to draw the attention of the international community to present situation in Kidal and send a â€œstrong messageâ€� regarding the restoration of government authority in the extreme northeast of the country, Malian Prime Minister Moussa Mara said.

On Saturday Malian security forces in Kidal were involved in violent clashes as they were protecting the visiting new Prime Minister Moussa Mara against â€œattackersâ€� opposed to the visit.

After the shootout, the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA, one of three rebel groups in northern Mali) described the Premier’s visit as a â€œprovocationâ€� and lashed out the Malian government’s declaration as an â€œact of warâ€�.

According to Malian ministry of defence, the fighting which lasted half of the night, caused 36 deaths including eight loyalist forces and 87 wounded including 25 loyalist troops.

On Sunday, UN force reported the â€œmurderâ€� of two civilians and six Malian officials without indicating whether they were some of the 30 people abducted by the â€œattackersâ€�.

President Keita, given the worrying trend in Kidal, has called an emergency summit of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), corroborative sources in the Malian capital said.
