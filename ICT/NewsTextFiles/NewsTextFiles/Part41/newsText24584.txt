
GENEVA (Reuters) - Cholera has broken out in the capital of South Sudan where five months of civil war has left thousands homeless and disrupted  food supplies and health services, according to the World Health Organization.

WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said on Monday nine people were believed to have died of cholera, which can kill in days if not treated. An estimated 138 had been registered so far in and around Juba.

"The outbreak has just started and it's spreading...Although they are not confirmed, we've got reports that other people in other areas are equally affected, so it is certainly spreading."

UNICEF has supplied tents, hygiene equipment, clean water and oral rehydration solutions for a treatment centre. Hundreds of people have been trained over the past 24 hours to inform and mobilise communities, the agency said in a statement.

The outbreak began days after South Sudan's army and rebel forces signed a ceasefire to try to stop five months of conflict.

U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said earlier this month that if fighting continued, half the population of 12 million will be fleeing, starving or dead by the end of the year.
