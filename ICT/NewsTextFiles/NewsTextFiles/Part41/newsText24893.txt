
Boeing executives are gathering in Seattle this week for the company's annual investor meeting, which could be the last for Chairman and CEO Jim McNerney .

Issues that may be addressed include whether the problems with the 787 Dreamliner have been resolved, whether the company is building too many planes if the slowdown in Asian's economy puts a dent in demand, and what the future of its military business will be as its fighter-jet factory in St. Louis is threatened with closure, the Wall Street Journal reports.

The event will put Dennis Muilenburg , Boeing's heir apparent, in the spotlight. Muilenburg, who formerly headed the company's Hazelwood-based defense and space unit, was appointed vice chairman, president and chief operating officer in December . While McNerney has said he has no plans to retire soon, at 64, he is months away from the company's mandatory retirement age for executives, and the appointment of Muilenburg has been the company's "clearest public signal of its succession planning," the Wall Street Journal reports.

This week's event will be "the biggest stage to date for Muilenburg," the newspaper reports.
