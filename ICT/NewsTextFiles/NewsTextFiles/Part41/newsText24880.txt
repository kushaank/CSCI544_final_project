
A US Airways plane flying from Venice to Philadelphia has had to divert to Dublin Airport, after three crew members reported being unwell.

The plane, with 238 people on board and 12 crew members, landed just after 2pm this afternoon.

Earlier this month another US Airways plane, also travelling from Venice to Philadelphia, had to divert to Dublin when a number of crew members became ill.

Nine people were treated at Beaumont Hospital.

US Airways said while the symptoms appear to be the same, the aircraft used for today's flight was different.
