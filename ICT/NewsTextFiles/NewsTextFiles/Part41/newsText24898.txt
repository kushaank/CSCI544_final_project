
Citigroup Inc. (“Citigroup”) today announced the commencement of        offers to purchase for cash (i) any and all of its notes of the series        set forth in the table below under the heading “CAD Notes,” and (ii) its        notes of the series set forth in the table below under the heading “U.S.        Dollar Notes” up to an aggregate principal amount with respect to each        series of U.S. Dollar Notes as set forth in the table below (each, a “Maximum        Series Tender Cap”) (all such notes collectively, the “Notes”).        The offer to purchase each series of Notes is referred to as an “Offer”        and all such offers are referred to collectively as the “Offers.”        The Notes had an aggregate principal amount outstanding of approximately        U.S. $6.66 billion as of May 16, 2014 (based on U.S. dollar exchange        rates as of that date).

The Offers are being made pursuant to the offer to purchase dated May        19, 2014 (as may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “Offer        to Purchase”), and the related letters of transmittal (as they may        be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “Letters of        Transmittal”) which set forth in more detail the terms and        conditions of the Offers. The Offers will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York        City time, on June 16, 2014, unless extended or earlier terminated (such        date and time, as the same may be extended with respect to each Offer,        the “Expiration Date”).

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase        and the Letters of Transmittal, Holders of Notes that are validly        tendered on or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 2, 2014,        unless extended (such date and time with respect to an Offer, as the        same may be extended with respect to such Offer, the “Early Tender        Date”) and accepted for purchase shall be entitled to receive the        total consideration calculated in the manner set forth in the Offer to        Purchase (the “Total Consideration”), which includes the        applicable early tender premium in the amount indicated in the table        above (the “Early Tender Premium”). The Total Consideration with respect to each series of Notes will be equal to the price,        determined in accordance with standard market practice, as described in        the Offer to Purchase, that equates to a yield to maturity equal to the        applicable fixed spread specified for each such series of Notes over the        applicable reference yield, which shall be based on the bid-side price        of the applicable Reference U.S. Treasury security or Reference Canadian        Government security, as the case may be, at 2:00 p.m., New York City        time, on June 3, 2014 (such date and time with respect to an Offer, as        the same may be extended with respect to such Offer, the “Price        Determination Date”).

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase,        Holders of a series of Notes that are validly tendered after the Early        Tender Date but on or before the Expiration Date and accepted for        purchase will receive only the applicable tender offer consideration,        which is equal to the Total Consideration applicable to that series of        Notes minus the applicable Early Tender Premium (the “Tender Offer        Consideration”).

Notes tendered may be withdrawn at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New York        City time, on June 2, 2014, unless extended (such date and time with        respect to an Offer, as the same may be extended with respect to such        Offer, the “Withdrawal Date”), but not thereafter.

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offers, Citigroup is offering        to purchase any and all CAD Notes of each series set forth in the table        above validly tendered pursuant to the Offers.

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offers, Citigroup is offering        to purchase an aggregate principal amount of each series of U.S. Dollar        Notes up to the applicable Maximum Series Tender Cap set forth in the        table above. If the aggregate principal amount of U.S. Dollar Notes of        any series validly tendered exceeds the Maximum Series Tender Cap for        such series, then Citigroup will accept tendered U.S. Dollar Notes of        such series on a pro rata basis as described in the Offer to Purchase.

Payment for Notes validly tendered prior to the Expiration Date and        accepted for purchase will be made on the settlement date, which is        anticipated to be June 19, 2014 (such date, unless the Offers are        extended, the “Settlement Date”). Payment for purchased Notes        will include accrued and unpaid interest from, and including, the last        interest payment date for the Notes up to, but not including the        Settlement Date.

Subject to applicable law, Citigroup may increase the Maximum Series        Tender Cap for one or more series of U.S. Dollar Notes at any time prior        to the Settlement Date. Such increase need not be made equally or on a        pro rata basis among the Maximum Series Tender Caps for all series of        U.S. Dollar Notes.

The obligation of Citigroup to accept for purchase and to pay for Notes        validly tendered pursuant to the Offers is subject to, and conditional        upon, the satisfaction or, where applicable, waiver of a number of        conditions described in the Offer to Purchase, including in the case of        the U.S. Dollar Notes, the condition that Holders validly tender an        aggregate principal amount of each series of U.S. Dollar Notes greater        than or equal to the Maximum Series Tender Cap applicable to each such        series of U.S. Dollar Notes (the “Minimum Tender Condition”).        Citigroup reserves the right, in its sole discretion to waive any one or        more of the conditions, including the Minimum Tender Condition, at any        time.
