Staff from Central and Western Oklahoma Red Cross spent time with El Reno fourth-graders Monday at Lincoln Elementary, educating them on what to do in case of tornado while also passing out pillowcases containing items that might be helpful in case of an emergency.

EL RENO — School may be winding down as summer approaches, but tornado preparedness has ramped up across the state as districts and other organizations seek to prepare students for whatever may come our way the rest of this storm season.

Staff from Central and Western Oklahoma Red Cross spent time with fourth-graders Monday at Lincoln Elementary in El Reno, educating them on what to do in case of tornado while also passing out pillowcases containing items that might be helpful in case of an emergency. The pillowcases also have a list of items printed on them kids can put inside that might be helpful in an emergency, including a flashlight, radio and water.

The students also learned the differences between tornado watches and tornado warnings and how to react when one occurs. El Reno was hit by a tornado May 31.

Central and Western Oklahoma Red Cross financial development director Tamara Pratt said the Red Cross hopes the pillowcases will lead parents and children to talk with each other about what families can do to stay safe during severe storms.

“The Pillowcase Project gets kids more aware of severe weather,” Pratt said. “It lets them know the science behind the storms. The icing on the cake is we give them a Disney and Red Cross branded pillow case with items that might be useful in a tornado.

Charlie Dewoody, a fourth-grader, enjoyed learning about storms. Her family home in El Reno was damaged by last year’s storms.

The Red Cross expects to reach about 700 students in El Reno this week with the project.
