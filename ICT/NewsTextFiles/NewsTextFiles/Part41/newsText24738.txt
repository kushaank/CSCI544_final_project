A host of residents and guests sampled a taste of the Brookdale Signature Suites open house at Freedom Plaza Care Center, a Brookdale Senior Living community that offers skilled nursing care, assisted living, rehabilitation therapy, Alzheimer’s and dementia care services in Peoria.

Freedom Plaza Care Center’s staff offered personal tours.

In addition to touring the newly renovated suites, visitors also received an inside look at the community’s amenities, including the therapy gym and aquatic therapy pool.

The guided tours continued along The Inn at Freedom Plaza’s Main Street with the ConnectedLiving Café, deli and library in the assisted living community.

Visitors were also treated to an array of fruits, cheese and chocolate croissants as they mingled to a mix of classical melodies by Joshua D. Pierce, an acoustic guitarist. Guests took home a sampling of the Brookdale Signature Cookie with a choice of white or chocolate milk, to add a sweet ending to the suite opening.

Freedom Plaza Care Center is located on the Freedom Plaza Retirement Campus at 13714 N. Plaza del Rio Blvd. in Peoria. For a personal tour, call 623-815-6170.
