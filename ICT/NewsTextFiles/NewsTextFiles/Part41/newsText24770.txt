
Greensboro-based Honda Aircraft Co., a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Honda Motor Co. (NYSE: HMC ), made a series of announcements on Monday related to the progress of a $4.5 million lightweight jet that the company expects to begin delivering to customers by early 2015.

The announcements were made by Honda during a press conference at the European Business Aviation Convention and Exhibition (EBACE) in Geneva, Switzerland. Honda expects to obtain aircraft type certification from the Federal Aviation Administration in the first quarter of 2015 and begin deliveries thereafter.

Honda unveiled its first production aircraft on Monday, which features a new paint scheme of deep pearl green with a gold stripe. The first production aircraft is now in final assembly, with the first set of production GE Honda HF120 engines recently delivered. Honda Aircraft said it will soon begin ground tests on the aircraft, with the first flight slated this summer.  The company expects to have 10 aircraft on the final assembly line in June.

Honda Aircraft is developing flight and maintenance training curricula, with maintenance training classes scheduled to begin later this year in Greensboro. The first flight simulator for flight training is complete and software integration is underway, the company said. Honda said the training at its world headquarters will begin before entry into service.
