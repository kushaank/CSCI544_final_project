
Meridian, Miss. Bikers from around the nation are set to descend on Meridian Monday afternoon for the annual Run for the Wall.

This will be the 14th year Meridian has played host to the veterans and the event offers area residents a chance to show their support for the bikers. The group is traveling from California to Washington, D.C. to show support for servicemen missing in action.

Organizers tell Newscenter 11 that local military should line up along the 49th Avenue bridge around 4:30 Monday afternoon. Area residents may line up on the 29th Avenue bridge at the same time.

The bikers will arrive at the Lauderdale County Ag Center around 5:00.
