
JOHANNESBURG/LONDON, May 19 (Reuters) - South African platinum miner Lonmin has lost a third of its annual production due to an industry strike over wages which its chief executive described as a "bleeding" that might lead to the company's death if not stopped in time.

South Africa's longest and costliest mining strike turned violent this month, with four miners killed as more employees tried to report for work at the world's top platinum producers.

Lonmin had anticipated a mass return of its employees to work last week, but striking members of the main Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) prevented many other workers from going back to the mines.
