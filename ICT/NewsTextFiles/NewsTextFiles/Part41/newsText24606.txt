
MOORE, Oklahoma May 19 (Reuters) - A year after a tornado ripped apart the Oklahoma city of Moore, killing 24 and injuring more than 300, residents face a shortage of storm shelters as they brace for a new season of potentially deadly twisters.

The city plans on Tuesday to remember those who perished with memorials for the victims, including the seven children killed at the Plaza Towers Elementary School.

Since the May 20, 2013 tornado hit Moore, with a population 55,000, more than 1,100 shelters, either underground bunkers or above-ground, heavily anchored safe rooms, have been built, city spokeswoman Diedre Beery said.

But demand has far outstripped supply of the specialized structures, usually made of thick steel that sell for about $3,000 to $6,000, said Abby Brown, sales manager for GSF Storm Shelters in Oklahoma.

"We have a pretty big waiting list," said Brown.

Moore city officials estimate hundreds of people are awaiting shelters.

Oklahoma was hit by 19 tornadoes last year, including the EF5 monster on May 20 in Moore, located just south of Oklahoma City. EF5 is the highest rating on the Enhanced Fujita scale that measures tornado intensity. Winds topping 210 mph (340 kph) destroyed or damaged about 2,400 buildings, including two elementary schools.
