
YANGON, Myanmar –  A Chinese company says two workers have been kidnapped from a Myanmar copper mine by activists demanding the project be cancelled.

The Wanbao Mining company released a statement Monday condemning what it called an "unprovoked act."

It says a group called "Student Activists from Mandalay" abducted the men on Sunday.

The Letpadaung mine is a joint venture between a Myanmar military-controlled holding company and China's Wanbao Mining Copper Ltd. It was the scene of violent clashes between police and protesters in 2012.

Activists argue the deal lacks transparency because it did not undergo parliamentary scrutiny under the previous military regime. They say it is causing environmental, social and health problems.
