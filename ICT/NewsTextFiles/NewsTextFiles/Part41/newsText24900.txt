
Patrons visiting Klyde Warren Park have a new space to sit back and relax.

The Southwest Porch, sponsored by Southwest Airlines, opened Monday and offers couches, chairs and wooden tables, along with free Wi-Fi, on Olive Street above the westbound lanes of Woodall Rodgers Freeway.

The covered porch is an extension of Relish, the park’s already operating quick fare restaurant. The airline created its first Southwest Porch in 2009 in Manhattan’s Bryant Park, extending the program to Denver, Atlanta and Dallas, which now has two (the other is in Annette Strauss Square in the Arts District).

Green says the area will be used for indie music events, poetry readings and book clubs, along with serving as a spot for guests to relax.

Kevin Krone, chief marketing officer for Southwest, used the opening of the porch to reveal new routes the company will begin offering in October with the lifting of flight restrictions at Love Field. Krone believes the park offers a refreshing change for the Southwest brand.

The porch is an extension of the Relish restaurant and also features eating areas.
