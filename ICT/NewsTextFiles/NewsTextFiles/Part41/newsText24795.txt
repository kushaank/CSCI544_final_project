
Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung Electrontronics Co. Ltd. (KRX:005930) might be nearing an agreement that could bring an end to patent infringement cases between the tech rivals, the Korea Times reports . The deal comes as one of the largest of several such cases between them closes, with jurors awarding Apple more than $119 million and Samsung just over $158,000.

“Samsung has recently resumed working-level discussions with Apple and the key issue is how to dismiss all lawsuits,” said a source directly involved in the matter who declined to be named.

The fact that California jurors found Apple guilty of infringing on Samsung’s patents aided the discussions, the source said. But the agreement will take time to come to fruition as the parties need to discuss royalties and licensing foundations prior to settling.

"Some more time will be needed to fix terms of details such as royalty payments in return for using patents owned by each before reaching a full agreement," the source said.

In 2012, a jury awarded Apple more than $1 billion (later reduced to $930 million) in damages for Samsung infringing on iPhone patents.
