
Credit Suisse issued a ‘neutral’ rating for Coca-Cola HBC after the bottling company reported a fall in first quarter revenue and volumes.

The second largest bottler of the brands of The Coca-Cola Company said volume declined by 4% to 409.6 cases in the three months to March 28th and new sales revenue fell 7% to EUR1.3bn.

It blamed the timing of Easter and foreign exchange movements.

Despite the challenging trading conditions, the company’s expectations for the full-year remained unchanged.

‘The first quarter is always a small quarter and liable to sharp swings so should never be extrapolated for the year,’ Credit Suisse said.
