
VALLETTA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- An Air Malta passenger plane flying from Frankfurt was forced to make an emergency landing in Malta Sunday night when its wing flaps allegedly failed to deploy, local media reported Monday.

The aircraft landed safely at Luqa airport and there were no injuries, reports said, adding that Malta airport was equipped with one of the longest runways in Europe.

Passengers on flight KM 0329 were warned of the emergency landing, for which airport fire crews were positioned on the tarmac as a precaution, Air Malta officials confirmed to local media.

The spokesman said the aircraft fault was later repaired by maintenance technicians and that the plane would reenter service Monday.

The Frankfurt-Vallette route is the second busiest international flight route out of Malta (after London-Gatwick) with about 250,000 passengers in 2013.
