
They deliver more capital to entrepreneurs than any other source. And they often receive an incredible return on their investments. They're angel investors, some of the most important-and least understood-players in business today, whose investments in startups exceed $20 billion per year. Many, if not most, of the world's largest companies were originally funded by angels-companies like Apple, Microsoft, LinkedIn and Amazon.com. But until now, little has been written about these angels, due in part to their preference for anonymity. The New York Times bestseller ANGEL INVESTING: The Gust Guide to Making Money and Having Fun Investing in Startups (Wiley; April 2014) by David S. Rose provides an inside look at who these angels are, how they operate, and how anyone with six figures to invest can potentially generate annual returns of 25% while funding tomorrow's industry leaders...and having a lot of fun in the process.

In the past few years, angel investing has moved from an arcane, tiny backwater of the financial world to a business arena that receives coverage in mainstream newspapers and smash hit television shows such as ABC's Shark Tank. Every year angels invest over $20 billion into startup companies in the US alone (and double that amount worldwide). Historically this been a virtually random activity, but over the past several years angel investing has begun to be recognized as a legitimate part of the Alternative Investments asset class.

With a foreword by Reid Hoffman-co-founder of LinkedIn and a prolific angel investor himself-together with hard research studies and a host of stories from his personal experience as one of the world's leading angels, Rose explains in this book precisely how angels and venture capitalists differ, describes proven ways for entrepreneurs to attract them, and provides all the relevant resources for investors to enter into the world of startup funding.
