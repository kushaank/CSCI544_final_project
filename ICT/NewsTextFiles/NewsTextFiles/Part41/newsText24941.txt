
El Paso City development Spokesman Javier Camacho told ABC-7 the building is owned by Minco Properties, but was currently unoccupied. It is in between a florist and a floral supply business. Â Three tenants total were evacuated, the utilities shut off, the sidewalk and alley are now closed. The city is deeming the area "unsafe."

Camacho said the city received a plan to make the building a retail store last week, but after the collapse, more requirements will be needed before any plans move forward. He said city inspectors will be checking up on the building, putting up an exoskeleton to help support it.
