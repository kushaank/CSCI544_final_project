BATAVIA, NY - With Memorial Day and Armed Forces Week this month, it's fitting that Genesee County has a newly dedicated war memorial to honor those local men and women who died while in service to this country.

Many veterans turned out Saturday for the dedication of a new granite monument at Washington and Bank streets in Batavia, which replaces an older memorial that was displaced by the expansion of the United Memorial Medical Center.

One Batavia woman who lost two brothers in the Navy in World War II was there. Their names are among the 283 names etched on the monument.
