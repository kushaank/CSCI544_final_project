
DirecTV is the nation's No. 1 satellite television provider and it's the fourth largest telecommunications merger in history, but a proposed merger with AT&T is far from a done deal.

Critics of the merger are already wondering what it could mean as far as prices and jobs.

The DirecTV call center is big business for Missoula and is the fourth largest employer in the area with more than 800 employees. Those employees aren't talking to the media.  However, managers did say nothing is changing at the call center and it's business as usual.

In fact, they are even hiring. An open house is scheduled for Tuesday at the call center.

The merger has an estimated value of $49 billion. It could take at least a year for federal regulators to approve the action. In the meantime, DirecTV pledges to keep its 20 million U.S. subscribers informed of developments.
