Fighters have separated into different autonomous groups roaming across remote parts of Africa, and "the role of the son is an indication Kony has lost contact with most of his commanders, some who have been killed by our forces and others are in disarray, with the rebels becoming weaker," Kavuma says, according to AFP .

Salim Saleh is said to have spent his life fighting with his father's violent rebel forces. "Previously the son was in charge of the group providing security to the father, but now he has an added responsibility of field command," Kavuma says. The LRA continues to evade Ugandan troops and US special forces attempting to hunt it down . In November, there were reports Kony was ill and his reign might be nearing an end . In a report last week, the UN said Kony is hiding in a Sudanese-controlled area of the disputed border between South Sudan and the Central African Republic, al-Jazeera reports, and Voice of America adds that a UN official predicted Kony's capture is "coming pretty soon."

In certain ways, Kony is the model for Boko Haram. Different religions, similar M.O.

Oh will this ever go away. There were far worse and more organized terrorist factions than Joseph Kony, yet idiot Americans started that ignorant Kony2012 campaign that ended with the Documentarian jackin' it in San Diego.
