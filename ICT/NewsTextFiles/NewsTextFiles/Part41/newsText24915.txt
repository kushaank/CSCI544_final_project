
The U.K. Takeover Code–designed to provide a clear set to rules for mergers and acquisitions–can sometimes seem opaque and confusing.

Alas not. Under the U.K. rules, final means final.  And Pfizer added for good measure that it would not take a hostile offer direct to Astra’s investors.

Pfizer has until May 26th to make a firm offer for AstraZeneca. But, given its statements on Sunday, it can now only do so with the recommendation of Astra’s board and at a price no more than £55 a share.

The certainty and speed of Astra’s rejection makes that highly unlikely. Moreover, U.K. rules would then prohibit Pfizer from making a bid for Astra for six months, unless recommended by the target’s board.  For the first three months, its “no increase” statement would still apply, meaning a deal would need to be agreed at £55 a share.
