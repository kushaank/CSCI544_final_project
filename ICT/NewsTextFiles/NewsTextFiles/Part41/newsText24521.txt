
FIMBank unveiled the prototype of a humanitarian shelter designed and developed by a group of University of Malta third year students from the Faculty for the Built Environment reading for the degree of BSc (Built Environment Studies), as part of their studies to become professional architects.  The shelter, nicknamed “Speranza”, is currently on display outside the Fort as one of the satellite exhibits at the Malta Design Week.

FIMBank partnered with the University of Malta and the NGO 808 Foundation where architects Chris Briffa and Sandro Valentino took on the role of lead project managers and design tutors to the group of students. Mr Briffa is a design tutor at the University of Malta, and renowned locally for promoting the awareness of architectural design. The brief for this project was to design a simple, sustainable and well-insulated unit by introducing low-cost improvements to existing technology effectively creating an enhanced shelter-solution. Periti Briffa and Valentino led a team of fifteen university students to work on this project with the aim of combining the elements of research and design with this core humanitarian objective.

During the course of their research the team discovered the existence of pre-fabricated units that are built-for-purpose and are easy to transport and assemble. Fortunately, a local company, HMK International, is involved in the production of similar units. Its Director, Karl Mifsud Cremona, was instrumental in providing the technical know-how and human resources necessary to perform the modifications and enhancements to the Pagin s.p.a. M1 model structure.

 The student team consisted of Justin Mizzi, Julian Vassallo, Katrina Gauci, Samuel Bonello, Andrea Zerafa, Jonathan Avellino, Ryan Saliba, Bobby Pace, Paula Grech, Sacha Cutajar, Rene Fava, Martha Borg, Neal Vella, Stacy Rapa, and Matthew Muscat.
