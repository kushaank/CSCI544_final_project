Military technology designed to stabilize equipment for soldiers in the middle of combat has now been re-purposed for an entirely new set of clientele: Those who suffer uncontrollable tremors in their hands.

The technology has been placed into a spoon — a high-tech spoon outfitted with a tiny computer system — and now those who could barely feed themselves because of shaky hands and a diagnosis of essential tremor are finding a new sense of independence.

“In some ways, it seems too simple to be true,” said Kelvin Chou , a University of Michigan neurologist and a specialist at treating those with tremors, the Detroit Free Press reported.

The spoon’s technology basically senses which direction the tremors are headed — and gauges their strength — and adjusts accordingly, softening the shakes. Eating, applying makeup, performing daily fine motor tasks are all easier, users found.

The technology has been tested for 15 adults with tremors — some of whom could no longer feed themselves or were too embarrassed to eat in front of others.
