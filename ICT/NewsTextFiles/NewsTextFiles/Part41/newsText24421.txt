
New Delhi, May 19 (IBNS): The death of an Indian Army soldier in an alleged attack by Pakistani military, barely three days after a election victory brought Hindu-nationalist Narendra Modi to power in New Delhi, has cast a shadow on the already-testy ties between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.

All eyes will now be on Modi who won the election championing a stronger and more assertive national security outlook and had frequently chided the previous government for allegedly being soft on foreign aggression.

The latest incident took place at around 10 am on Sunday, when a team of the Maratha Light Infantry had gone to rescue a soldier who was injured while planting landmines on the Indian side at the Pallanwalla sector in Jammu and Kashmir near the border with Pakistan, reports said.

Pakistani troops opened fire on the patrol team and wounded three soldiers, one of whom later died of the injuries.

The deceased has been identified as Sepoy Bhikale while The injured jawans - Head Constable Vinod Kumar and Lance Naik Amol Kumar - have been admitted to the military hospital, Northern Command for treatment.

While Pakistani military sources denied firing at Indian soldiers, an official statement from India's defence ministry blamed infiltrators for the attack.

The militants had planted an IED near a track and triggered the blast to target the troops, an army official said.

According to Indian Army sources, there have been several infiltration attempts by Pakistani militants along the Line of Control that divides the two countries.

On May 10, two militants were reportedly killed in the Poonch sector, where infiltrators had tried to enter earlier on May 3.
