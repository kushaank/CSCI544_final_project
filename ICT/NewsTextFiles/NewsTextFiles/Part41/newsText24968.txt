
Both MasTec and Dycom are construction companies with a significant communications infrastructure business.

In the press release announcing the merger, AT&T commented that it would expand its broadband offering to 15 million customers, most of which will be in rural areas. Thalhimer commented on the infrastructure expenditure, saying he expects AT&T to spend between $3 billion and $9 billion over four years on this infrastructure.

The press release indicates that this expansion will only take place if AT&T is able to acquire DirecTV. Because many are concerned about the viability of the deal (government regulation, a counter offer from Dish, etc.) expansion in MasTec’s and Dycom’s business is far from a sure deal.

BB&T currently has a Buy rating on Dycom and Hold rating on MasTec. The companies are trading 1.82 percent and 0.10 percent higher, respectively.
