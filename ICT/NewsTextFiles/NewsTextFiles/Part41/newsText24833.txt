
Discounted admission in honor of the seventh anniversary of the World          of Coca-Cola at Pemberton Place on May 24.

Happiness is all around us and it happens every day. That’s the spirit        of the new film in the Coca-Cola Theater. The six-minute film celebrates        some of life’s most memorable moments experienced by people of different        ages and cultures around the world.

With the new World of Coca-Cola Explorer mobile app, guests can        experience the attraction like never before. For those visiting the        Atlanta attraction, the app is a great way to interact with more stories        and deepen their experience.

The mobile app is designed to be used at the World of Coca-Cola. Guests        can check in automatically when they arrive by enabling Bluetooth on        their iPhones. The app then delivers engaging content as they travel        throughout the attraction. After unlocking the app features, guests can        continue to enjoy them long after their visit.

Opening May 23, the World of Coca-Cola’s new exhibit in the Pop Culture        gallery will feature works from Howard Finster. A self-taught artist and        Baptist minister from Georgia, Finster is considered one of the most        important folk artists of the 20th century. He loved        Coca-Cola and often used the iconic bottle shape in his artwork.

The Atlanta attraction is celebrating its seventh anniversary since it        moved to Pemberton Place in downtown Atlanta with a special ticket offer        for early risers. Beginning at 9 a.m. on Saturday, May 24, the first 700        guests to purchase tickets at walk-up ticket windows will pay $7 for        general admission with a limit of seven discounted tickets per guest.        The discount represents a $9 savings from the regular adult ticket price.

The discounted tickets will not be available online, and will only be        valid for admission on May 24. Regular general admission ticket prices        will apply following the 700th guest.
