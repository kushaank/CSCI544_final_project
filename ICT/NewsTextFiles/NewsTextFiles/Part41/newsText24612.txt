
NEW YORK, May 19 (Reuters) - Cotton futures fell to a five-week low on Monday, as favorable weather for planting improved the crop outlook in key regions of the United States, the world's largest exporter.

The benchmark July cotton contract on ICE Futures U.S.  ended down 0.67 cent, or 0.9 percent, at 89.15 cents a lb as long liquidation pressured prices to a seventh straight daily loss, the longest rout for the front-month contract since November 2013.

Prices dipped to 89.12 cents, a five-week low for the front-month.

Expectations of rain in the cotton hub of West Texas weighed, as the precipitation could provide some relief from a multi-year drought in the top-producing state.

Total market open interest fell to 189,062 lots on Friday, down by about 5,500 lots from the previous week, ICE data showed on Monday.
