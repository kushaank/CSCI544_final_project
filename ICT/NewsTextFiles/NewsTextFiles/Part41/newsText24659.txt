The remaining shares, worth around €6.25bn will be offered to existing investors in a rights offering opportunity. This offering us underwritten by a consortium of six banks that have agreed to buy shares investors do not pick up.

Deutsche Bank has faced a number of legal probes over the past few months, chief among them was the investigation over the rigging of benchmark rates and currencies. Added to its worries is the upcoming ECB examination this year, which will assess the bank’s resilience in the face of a crisis. In preparation for these stress tests, Deutsche Bank has been endeavouring to shrink its balance sheet, as well as fortifying its finances. The bank has previously revealed plans to reach a 12 percent return on equity goal by 2016, a year earlier than previously expected.

Under the terms of the deal the Qatari royal family will pay €29.20 per share, around five percent lower than the closing price on May 16, the last trading day before the deal was finalised. When dividends have been considered, the royal family will receive a 2.5 percent discount on its purchase. It is understood that existing investors will be offered an even greater discount on the remaining 300 million shares available.

The Qatari royal family has been involved in previous deals with Deutsche Bank, most recently acquiring part of the €3bn in new shares the bank issued in 2013.
