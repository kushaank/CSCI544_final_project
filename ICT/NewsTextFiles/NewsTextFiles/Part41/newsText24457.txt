BETHESDA, Md. (AP) — Some of Maryland's top elected officials are announcing the start of road work to ease traffic congestion near the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown and Sen. Ben Cardin are among the dignitaries giving a ceremonial "green light" Monday to the $13.8 million project at the intersection of Cedar Lane and state Route 355.

The project will widen the state highway north of Cedar Lane to extend an auxiliary lane. Engineers say it will increase the capacity for northbound traffic through the intersection and reduce delays during the evening rush.

The project is part of a 2005 military base realignment plan that moved the former Walter Reed Army Medical Center from Washington to the Bethesda campus of the former National Naval Medical Center in 2011.
