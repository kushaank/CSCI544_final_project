
AstraZeneca on Monday rejected a "final" $119 billion buyout offer from Pfizer , possibly sinking a pharmaceutical mega-merger that could have jeopardized jobs at AZ's Maryland subsidiary, MedImmune .

Pfizer, which would have created the world's largest drug company through the deal, on Sunday evening increased its earlier $106 billion cash-and-stock bid . In a statement , AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson called that new offer "inadequate" and said it would have "serious consequences for the company, our employees and the life-sciences sector in the U.K., Sweden and the U.S."

Johansson's statement underscores the fears of job losses surrounding an AstraZeneca/Pfizer deal, including at MedImmune, a cornerstone Montgomery County biotech company now serving as a biologics R&D center for its U.K. parent. Maryland lawmakers sought guarantees from Pfizer that MedImmune wouldn't be gutted under the acquisition. MedImmune, meanwhile, had touted its portfolio â€” especially the immunotherapy product MEDI4736 â€” to help make the case that Pfizer's bid was too low.

The rejection leaves MedImmune intact, for now. Since buying the Maryland company for $15.6 billion in 2007, AstraZeneca has fundamentally reshaped MedImmune while preserving it as a major job center. That stands in sharp contrast with GlaxoSmithKline's treatment of Rockville-based Human Genome Sciences .
