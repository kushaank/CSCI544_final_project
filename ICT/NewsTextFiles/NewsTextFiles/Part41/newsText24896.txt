
Typical May weather will prevail in Central Texas this week as temperatures heat up.

Highs for the next seven days will likely be in the upper 80s to nearly 90 degrees. Strong, southerly breezes will continue to prevail, with gusts near 20 to 30 mph at times. Sunshine will break out each afternoon through at least Wednesday.

As temperatures cool off each night, low clouds are expected to re-develop and will probably fill the skies for several hours every morning this week.

Computer models indicate cloud cover will increase toward the end of the week as additional moisture from the Gulf pumps northward.

A new Pacific disturbance will swirl into the Desert Southwest later this week and then push closer to Texas Sunday, bringing with it an at least 20 percent chance for showers and storms. That will be the area's most immediate chance for organized rain.

In the meantime, a bit of drizzle could fall from the morning overcast. Our in-house model shows very light accumulations, less than one-tenth of an inch in most cases, through midweek.
