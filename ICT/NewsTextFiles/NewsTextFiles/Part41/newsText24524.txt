
Ball Corp. ( BLL : Quote ) Monday said it plans to build a one-line beverage can manufacturing plant in Myanmar.

The company expects the plant to complement its existing operations in Southeast Asia. The most recent was a joint venture plant in Vietnam, which began production in 2012.

"The demand for beverage containers in Southeast Asia is expected to continue to grow significantly over the coming years," said John Hayes, chairman, president and chief executive officer.

"Thanks to long-standing relationships, we are able to align the new plant's capacity with the local filling needs of Coca-Cola Pinya Beverages and several other local, regional and multi-national customers," said Gihan Atapattu, president, Ball Asia Pacific Ltd.
