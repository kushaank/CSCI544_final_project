
A U.S. Air Force plan to shrink its pool of four-star generals could deal a blow to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base .

The report cites an Air Force official, who compares the downgrades to a BRAC-like move in Congressional districts.

Wright-Patt has one of the coveted four-star general spots: the leader of Air Force Materiel Command, which has been filled by Gen. Janet Wolfenbarger for nearly two years.

Hereâ€™s why this is such a big deal: Ohioâ€™s Congressional delegation â€” along with the state of Ohio and the Dayton Development Coalition â€” have been pushing hard to position Wright-Patt to withstand expected military cuts. Having the AFMC commander position downgraded could be a serious blow to Wright-Pattâ€™s clout.

My sources say the AFMC position moves on and off the list of possibilities. (If AFMC were to lose the four-star status, that doesn't mean Wolfenbarger would be demoted. She would likely be stationed at another base).

Officials from the Air Force and the offices of U.S. Rep. Mike Turner (R-Dayton) and U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) have yet to return calls for comment.

Wright-Patt â€” considered one of the most organizationally complex bases in the Air Force â€” has about a $4.4 billion economic impact on the Dayton region. It is the largest single-site employer in the state of Ohio and supports tens of thousands of additional jobs outside the fence.
