
Germany's biggest lender Deutsche Bank AG ( DB : Quote ) announced Sunday plans to raise about 8 billion euros or $11 billion, of capital through the sale of a total of 360 million new shares in order to ease capital concerns to overcome tighter regulatory requirements, increased cost of compliance and litigation.

The capital raise will enable the bank to substantially increase its capital ratio, provide a buffer for future regulatory requirements, and support targeted business growth.

Deutsche Bank was earlier looking to strengthen capital through retained earnings, but it has been unsuccessful due to a 34 percent decline in profit reported for the first quarter.

The company now plans to raise about 6.25 billion euros through a fully underwritten rights issue of about 300 million new shares, and well as another 1.75 billion euros through placement of about 60 million new shares to the Qatari royal family at a price of 29.20 euros per share.

The subscription period for the rights issue of about 300 million shares is expected to run through June 24, 2014.

The Qatari royal family is making the investment through Paramount Holdings Services Ltd., an investment vehicle owned and controlled by His Excellency Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabor Al-Thani of Qatar. He intends to remain an anchor investor in Deutsche Bank.

The price tag to the  Qatari royal family is at a discount of 5 percent to the bank's closing price on Frankfurt's Xetra of 30.74 euros on Friday. The discount for the 300 million additional shares is reportedly expected to be about 25 percent at about 23 euros per share.

The capital measures will boost Deutsche Bank's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio by about 230 basis points to 11.8 percent, on a pro forma CRD4 fully-loaded basis, at the end of the first quarter 2014.

The ratio, which stood below 6 percent in mid-2012, has been strengthened under the bank's Strategy 2015+.

Further, Deutsche Bank reaffirmed its commitment to Strategy 2015+ and provided updated financial aspirations and further details of an accelerated growth strategy.

Under Strategy 2015+, the bank has already improved CET1 capital ratio by more than 350 basis points, on a pro forma CRD4 fully-loaded basis, through 360 billion euros of CRD4 exposure reductions, and 2.3 billion of cumulative cost savings from the Bank's operational excellence program or OpEx.

Deutsche Bank has now reaffirmed the cumulative OpEx savings target of 4.5 billion euros by end of 2015. The bank also said the accelerated delivery of target CET1 ratio, will exceed 10 percent on a pro forma CRD4 fully loaded basis. It also introduced a  leverage ratio target of about 3.5 percent by end of 2015 on a pro forma CDR4 fully-loaded basis.

Deutsche Bank noted that it is also looking to return surplus capital to shareholders, including in the form of competitive dividend payout ratios, in the long-term.

DB closed Friday's regular trading session at $42.17, up $0.10 or 0.24% on a volume of 1.74 million shares.
