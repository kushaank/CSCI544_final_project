
The annual tradition with local law enforcement and the Special Olympics continues this year.

The Nebraska State Patrol, North Platte Police Department, Lincoln County Sheriffs, and the Union Pacific Railroad Police all raise money to support Special Olympics with a torch run.

The route is along Highway 30 from Maxwell to Cody Park in North Platte.

That's 15 miles that the runners are taking in.

Organizers say the reason they do this is to make difference in the lives of Special Olympic athletes as they prepare for the state games.

"The Law Enforcement Torch Run in Nebraska is the largest grass roots fundraiser for the Special Olympics and it goes for the athletes going to the state games here this week for housing, insurance, transportation, food, and whatnot," Nebraska State Patrol SargeantÂ  Bob Veal said.

The Nebraska Special Olympics get underway this Thursday, May 22nd, in Omaha.
