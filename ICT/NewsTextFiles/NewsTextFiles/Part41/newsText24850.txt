
For the most recent earnings report, SKX absolutely crushed the consensus estimate. Earnings came in at 61 cents a share, far better than the 33 cent per share profit that analysts were expecting. This follows up a strong beat for SKX to close out 2013, and it actually helped to push the average beat over the last four quarters to a truly impressive 125%.

In the companyâ€™s most recent report, it just missed analyst estimates of 76 cents a share, posting earnings of 75 cents instead. This follows up a miss in the previous quarter as well, suggesting that GNC is having great difficulty in meeting analyst expectations.
