
Google said it is buying Divide, a mobile-device-management startup, to help the Internet giant’s Android business reach more business customers.

A purchase price wasn’t disclosed.

Divide, founded by former Morgan Stanley information-technology executives, helps companies manage the growing number – and variety — of mobile devices used by employees.

Android is the world’s most popular mobile-operating system, but is less common inside companies. This lucrative enterprise market used to be dominated by BlackBerry , but Apple , Google and Microsoft are trying to wrest market share from the troubled Canada-based company.

Complicating matters, many companies now allow employees to connect their own smartphones and tablets to the corporate network, a practice known as Bring Your Own Device, or BYOD. That’s made life more challenging for corporate-technology managers.

Those managers generally have preferred devices using Apple’s iOS operating system because it is relatively easy to set up and relatively secure, said Chris Jones, principal analyst at Canalys, a technology research firm. For instance, apps are tested extensively by Apple before they are allowed into the company’s App Store, which makes IT managers more comfortable, Jones noted.

In contrast, Google has exerted less control over the apps in its Play store and some Android apps have contained malware in the past, Jones said.

Moreover, Android devices are made by many manufacturers and use different version of Google’s operating system, said Ojas Rege, vice president of strategy at MobileIron, another mobile-device-security company. By contrast, Apple and BlackBerry make all of their own devices, simplifying the challenge, he said.

Divide and MobileIron are among several mobile-device-management companies that help corporate-tech staffers keep employee smartphones and tablets secure in the workplace. These services help companies track how mobile devices are being used, control what apps are downloaded by employees, update apps with the latest versions, check for viruses and other security threats and remotely wipe devices if needed.

Google should benefit from bringing some of these capabilities in house, Jones said.
