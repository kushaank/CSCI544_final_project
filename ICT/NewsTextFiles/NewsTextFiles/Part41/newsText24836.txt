
The Joplin Area Habitat for Humanity broke ground Monday on a new home on Picher Avenue.  The organization is partnering with General Mills for the construction.

Since the 2011 tornado Habitat for Humanity has partnered to build 84 new homes to assist in the rebuilding of Joplin.

"General Mills has been a long time sponsor for Joplin Habitat," says Scott Clayton of Joplin Area Habitat for Humanity.  "They have assisted us for several years.  Not only for funds and grants we have applied but also donations to our restores."

During Monday's ceremony General Mills presented a $17,000 check to Habitat to be used in the home's construction.
