
AstraZeneca chairman Leif Johansson has told ITV News he believes a potential takeover deal with Pfizer is "at the end of the road" after a number of issues remained unresolved.

He said Pfizer were told that they would have to raise last week's bid by at least 10% for it to be recommended to shareholders, "assuming other aspects of the deal" could be resolved.

"Neither of the two happened so that's where I think we are at the end of the road," he said.
