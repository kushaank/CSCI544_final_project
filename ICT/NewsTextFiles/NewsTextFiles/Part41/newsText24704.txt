
Britain’s AstraZeneca on Monday rejected a sweetened and “final” offer from Pfizer , undermining the US drugmaker’s plan for a merger to create the world’s biggest pharmaceuticals group.

The rebuff came nine hours after Pfizer said on Sunday it had raised its takeover offer to £55 a share, or around £70 billion ($118 billion) in total, and would walk away if AstraZeneca did not accept it.

Shares in AstraZeneca tumbled 13 per cent to £42 by late morning as prospects of a takeover ebbed away.

AstraZeneca chairman Leif Johansson said he had made clear in discussions with Pfizer that his board could only recommend a bid that was at least 10 per cent above an offer of £53.50 made by Pfizer on Friday, or £58.85.
