
KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda's coffee exports in April rose by 35 percent year-on-year to 336,676 60-kg bags, helped by rising global prices, a source at the state agency said on Monday.

"During the month, there was a slight increase in the farm gate coffee prices in tandem with the positive price change on the global markets," UCDA said in a monthly report for April.

According to UCDA, farmgate prices averaged 1,700 shillings ($0.67) per kilogramme of raw coffee in April compared to 1,300 in January.
