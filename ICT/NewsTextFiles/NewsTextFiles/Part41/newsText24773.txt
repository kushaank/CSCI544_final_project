
Tesla ( TSLA ) is now the number one auto employer in California, topping Toyota ( TM ) and Ford ( F ).

The electric car maker now has a grand total of 6,000 employees in the state, according to  Bloomberg . A spokesman for the company said that Tesla will add at least 500 employees in California by the end of the year.

The company has surpassed Toyota — California’s previous number one auto employer — for the title by about 700 employees. This gap is expected to widen as Toyota will move its headquarters from California to Texas.

TSLA stock is up over 2% Monday after Morgan Stanley reiterated its ‘overweight’ rating and $320 per share price target on Tesla.

TM stock is down about 0.8% today and F stock is up close to 1%.
