
Google's photo sharing site of choice has long been Google+ , but today it's joining what's arguably a far more popular one: Instagram. Google announced this afternoon that it has  opened up an Instagram account , kicking things off with a short video of today's spinning Rubik's Cube doodle. It only has the one post so far, but it's following accounts for YouTube, Google Maps, and Google Glass, in case you're hungry for more tech in your Instagram feed. At the end of the day, the new account is really just another advertising vehicle for Google — it also has accounts on Facebook and Twitter — but Google suggests it'll be a fun way to follow along nonetheless.
