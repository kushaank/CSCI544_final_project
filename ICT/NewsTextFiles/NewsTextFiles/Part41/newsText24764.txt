A vehicle carrying a family of four his struck twice while traveling west on Highway 20.

A 33-year-old father died Sunday with his wife and two children in the car after a freak traffic accident on Highway 20 just east of the Santiam Summit in Jefferson County.

The man's family has been hospitalized in Bend, with one child flown to Oregon Health & Science University Hospital, according to the Oregon State Police.

The accident occurred at about 12:35 p.m. when the driver of an eastbound Ford Focus lost control on the wet highway. The car crossed into the westbound lane, colliding nearly head on with a Honda Accord carrying the family of four.

The crash spun the Accord into traffic. A Toyota sport utility vehicle collided with the Accord, impacting the driver's side.

The father was driving the Accord, police say. The mother is 32 and the children are 4 and 1.
