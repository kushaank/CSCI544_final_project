
SARAJEVO May 19 (Reuters) - Bosnia's power utility Elektroprivreda RS (EPRS) said on Monday it will sell 180 megawatts (MW) of power for May 20 delivery to Serbia utility EPS, whose output has been reduced 40 percent due to the worst flooding in over a century.

"Further deliveries will depend on the needs of Serbia's power utility Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS), as well as on the available surplus at EPRS," EPRS spokeswoman told Reuters.
