
DEARBORN (dpa-AFX) - Ford Motor Co (F) Monday said it is celebrating the 10-year anniversary of its groundbreaking Dearborn Truck Plant. Later this year, production of the all-new 2015 Ford F-150 gets under way at the plant.

F-150 is part of the Ford F-Series lineup, America's best-selling truck for 37 consecutive years and America's best-selling vehicle for 32 years.

The plant has produced over 2.6 million F-150 trucks since it opened in May 2004. Once home to the iconic Ford Mustang, the plant now has more than 3,600 employees on a three-crew operating pattern, producing 1,200 F-150 trucks daily.

The plant is capable of building up to nine models on three vehicle platforms. It has close to 350 robots between its body and paint shops and final assembly area. This summer, the body shop will undergo a complete renovation in preparation to build the all-new F-150, the company said.
