
Experts: Tesla Gigafactory 'an enormous roll of the dice'

Experts have plenty of questions about whether Tesla Motors can pull off its ambitious Gigafactory plan.

As Tesla Motors weighs whether to build its first battery Gigafactory in New Mexico or another state , the Wall Street Journal polled battery experts on whether they think the ambitious effort will work â€“ and the jury's out.

The WSJ pointed out that the Gigafactory would be able to make more lithium-ion batteries than all the factories in the world today. The media company also noted a prior effort by President Barack Obama 's administration to create a battery-manufacturing base in the U.S., pointing out that several manufacturers that built battery plants as part of that push went into bankruptcy.

â€¢ "I don't see how they can reduce the cost more than 20 percent."

â€¢ "Tesla is taking advantage of the moment to make an enormous roll of the dice ... In an industry that has hitherto been riddled by conservatism, this is a disruptive idea."

â€¢ "It's better to slowly add to production when you are making a profit than to shut down lines when you are losing money."

â€¢ "...if you are caught with a factory at the [wrong] time, that's where the obituary comes in."
