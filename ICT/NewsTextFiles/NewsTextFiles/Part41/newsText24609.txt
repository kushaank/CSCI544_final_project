May 19 (Reuters) - South African stocks edged up on Monday, recovering from losses in the previous session as shares of unsecured lender African Bank Investments climbed more than 5 percent from a decade low.

The bank, commonly known as Abil, added 5.3 percent to 8.9 rand after it reported an expected first-half loss, with investors betting the worst may be over for the company.

"African Bank had already given guidance that they would take a huge loss," said Desmond Reilly, an equity trader at PSG Securities. "Investors are seeing that possibly the shares were oversold now that the results are in black in white."

Last week Abil fell to its lowest since 2004, after earlier announcing that bad debts had ballooned more than expected.

The benchmark Top-40 index rose 0.76 percent to 44,413.84.

The broader All-Share index gained 0.71 percent to 49,507.48.
