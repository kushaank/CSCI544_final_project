
The head of Syria's air defence Forces has died in fighting near Damascus.

General Hussein Ishaq was said to have been wounded as rebels attacked an air defence base near the town of Mleiha yesterday, and later died.

He is one of a handful of high-ranking military officers to be killed in the country's civil war.

Rebels are fighting to depose President Bashar al-Assad's regime in a bloody conflict that begun three years ago.

Despite the war, the government plans to hold presidential election next month in areas under its control.

The director of the UK-based activist group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Rami Abdel Rahman, said Gen Ishaq's death is an "important psychological blow" to the regime.
