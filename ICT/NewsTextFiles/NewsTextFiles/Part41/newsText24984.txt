
Apparently Twitch had similar offers from other interested suitors including Microsoft and venture capitalists, but the company decided that a partnership with Google-owned YouTube would be more beneficial, as Google would have the ability really help Twitch grow. A person familiar with the matter said the company would have rejected a billion-dollar offer from companies other than YouTube .

Google and Twitch have yet to make the deal official.
