
MOSCOW May 19 (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday  Slovakia's agreement to allow reverse flows of gas to Ukraine from Europe did not violate agreements with Russia.

Ukraine has been trying to increase gas purchases from Europe via Slovakia after Russia almost doubled the price of gas. Moscow had suggested that reverse flows may violate Slovakia's contracts with state-controlled Gazprom.
