
PRINCETON, N.J. & NORTH CHICAGO, Ill.--( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Bristol-Myers        Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) today announced        that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted elotuzumab,        an investigational humanized monoclonal antibody, Breakthrough Therapy        Designation for use in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone        for the treatment of multiple myeloma in patients who have received one        or more prior therapies. The designation is based on findings from a        randomized Phase 2, open-label study that evaluated two dose levels of        elotuzumab in combination with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone        in previously-treated patients, including the 10 mg/kg dose that is        being studied in Phase 3 trials. Data from the Phase 2 trial were most        recently presented at the 18th Annual Congress of the European        Hematology Association (EHA) in 2013 (click here to view press release).

According to the FDA, Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to        expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or        life-threatening conditions. The criteria for Breakthrough Therapy        Designation require preliminary clinical evidence that demonstrates the        drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically        significant endpoint over available therapy.

Elotuzumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeted against        Signaling Lymphocyte Activation Molecule (SLAMF7, also called CS1), a        glycoprotein expressed on myeloma and Natural Killer cells but not        detectable in normal tissue. The company is investigating whether        through both direct activation and engagement of Natural Killer cells,        elotuzumab may selectively target and kill SLAMF7 expressing myeloma        cells.

Elotuzumab is being studied as a monotherapy in smoldering myeloma and        in combination with other therapies in first-line and relapsed or        refractory multiple myeloma. A clinical development program for the        agent is underway, including Phase 3 trials in first-line multiple        myeloma (ELOQUENT-1) and relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma        (ELOQUENT-2). Elotuzumab is also being investigated in a randomized        Phase 2 study of bortezomib and dexamethasone in relapsed or refractory        multiple myeloma.

Elotuzumab is being co-developed with AbbVie, with Bristol-Myers Squibb        leading the commercialization of the agent.

Multiple myeloma is a progressive hematologic cancer that originates in        the bone marrow. It is the second most common blood cancer and remains        incurable, with a 5-year survival rate of 44.9%. In 2014, it is        estimated that approximately 24,050 new cases will be diagnosed in the        U.S. and more than 11,000 Americans will die from the disease. Globally,        an estimated 750,000 people are living with myeloma.
