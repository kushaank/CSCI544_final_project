Part of the three tiered plan for further collaboration includes developing and co-marketing SAP mobile applications. According to the Microsoft blog, they are planning industry specific applications for retail and banking that will run on Windows powered mobile phones.

SAP business applications will be managed and secured by Windows Intune and SAP Mobile Secure. They will be certified to run on Microsoft Azure by the end of June. Eighty-six percent of global Fortune 500 companies use SAP software. Integration of these applications with Microsoft Azure will allow their customers to easily deploy software solutions to the cloud.

Other aspects of the plan include offering enterprise cloud computing with SAP applications certified for Microsoft Azure and improved data compatibility between Microsoft Office and SAP applications.
