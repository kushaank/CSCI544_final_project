
Marcventures Holdings Inc. on Monday said its nickel mining subsidiary had filed a motion asking the Mines and Geosciences Bureau to reconsider the stoppage of the nickel minerâ€™s operations in Surigao del Sur.

In an order issued on April 22, the MGB told Marcventures Mining and Development Corp. (MMDC) to stop its mining operations in Carrascal town and suspend its operations in Cantilan town for alleged violations of several provisions of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources Administrative Order (DAO) No. 2010-21.

According to Marcventures, in its motion dated May 8, it secured all the necessary approvals before starting operations in Carrascal. Also, Marcventures reiterated that it had complied with all the necessary measures within its control for its operations in Cantilan.

The agency also claimed that MMDC violated provisions of the DAO No. 2010-21 related to the use of the best available, appropriate and efficient mining technology; the submission of an environmental protection and enhancement program (Epep); and the submission of final mine rehabilitation/decommissioning plan.
