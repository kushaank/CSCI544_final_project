
A political milestone was reached on what Bitcoin supporters hope is the cryptocurrency's path to wide acceptance alongside such innovations as digital signatures and m-parking.

Silver Meikar, an independent candidate for European Parliament, stopped in for lunch and a photo op on Sunday at a hole-in-the-wall manga-themed Tallinn eatery that is one of the city's restaurants that accepts the method of payment.

His party's â‚¬78 check at Sushi Cat was paid by using two smartphones using a process not dissimilar to the one used by card payment terminals. The waitress entered the amount to be paid on her phone, which then calculated the price in bitcoins. The waitress then received a QR code on her phone. Meikar scanned that QR code with his own phone, and the payment was sent.
