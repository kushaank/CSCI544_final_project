
KATHMANDU: The Joint Tourism Coordination Committee, a group of agitating tourism entrepreneurs who are protesting against what they call massive corruption in the Nepal Tourism Board, has now found support of some political leaders.

The agitating entrepreneurs have been protesting against the NTB for the last 20 days, demanding that the government remove Subas Nirola from the post of acting chief executive officer to pave the way for appointment of new CEO, conduct independent auditing of NTB accounts and ensure institutional representation of the private sector in the board of NTB. Former prime minister and Unified CPN-Maoist leader Baburam Bhattarai today visited the agitating entrepreneurs, who are staging relay hunger strike on the NTB premises. Bhattarai has called on concerned authorities to address the genuine demands of tourism entrepreneurs.

Former home minister and Nepali Congress leader Purna Bahadur Khadka, CPN-UML Vice-chair Bidhya Bhandari, UCPN-M leader Agni Sapkota, UML leader Prakash Jwala and Youth Association Nepal Chairman Mahesh Basnet too have expressed solidarity with ongoing agitation of tourism entrepreneurs.

Pampha Dhamala, one of the board members of NTB, along with 24 representatives of different travel associations, participated in the relay hunger strike today.

The agitating tourism entrepreneurs had earlier issued a white paper on irregularities allegedly carried out by Acting CEO Nirola.
