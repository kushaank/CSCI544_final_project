
RAWLINS – The National Main Street Center Sunday named Rawlins as one of its first Main Streets to watch at the National Main Streets Conference in Detroit, Michigan.

According to the center, a program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation that encourages preservation-based economic revitalization, Rawlins has a lot of reasons to earn the recognition. Fifty-five of them, to be exact.

“Main Street Rawlins has completed 55 rehabilitation projects over its eight-year history and reduced street-level vacancies downtown from 45 percent to 10 percent,” a release from the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit said.

In March, the Rawlins Downtown Development Authority/Main Street program was announced as one of ten semifinalists for the Great American Main Street Award through the National Main Street Center. While the top awards went to Milledgeville, Georgia; Woodbine, Iowa; and Harrisonburg, Virginia, the Wyoming Business Council-supported Rawlins program earned the “Ones to Watch” designation alongside Middlesboro, Kentucky. This marks the first time the National Main Street Center used the designation, which it says goes to “organizations that are making great strides” in Main Street revitalization.

She went on to say that Rawlins has been entrepreneurial in their approach toward downtown revitalization while preserving history.

“We are committed to fostering a sustainable, revitalized and vibrant historic downtown that creates an economic environment while enhancing the quality of life for our community,” said Charlotte Newell, chair of the Rawlins DDA/Main Street board of directors.

The Wyoming Lottery launch drew customers who spent almost $200,000 buying Powerball and Mega Millions tickets Sunday after sales began statewide at noon.
