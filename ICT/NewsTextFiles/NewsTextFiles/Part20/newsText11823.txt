
New Delhi, May 19 (IANS) Hearing a plea of a woman whose husband has been missing for six months now, the Delhi High Court has directed police to trace out the man, who was working as a private driver with an executive engineer in New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC).

Kudrat Khatoon approached the high court, filing a Habeas Corpus petition and asking her missing husband, Mohammad Anjil Sheikh, to be brought before the court.

In the plea, she stated that on Nov 14, 2013, her husband did not return from work and when she contacted her husband's boss, he said that he has already lodged a report with police regarding Sheikh  missing with his Maruti car.

However, Khatoon said that she has apprehension that Sheikh's boss has been illegally detaining her husband and he is also misdirecting the investigation. Sheikh took up the job in July 2013.

On the other hand, police informed the high court bench that all efforts have been made by them to trace Khatoon's missing husband but to no avail.

A division bench of Justice Kailash Gambhir and Justice Sunita Gupta asked police to find out Sheikh and to carry out investigation from all possible angles.

"Considering the fact that the police are making all possible efforts to trace out the missing husband of the petitioner.. let all sincere efforts be put by police to trace out the husband of the petitioner and investigation be carried out from all possible angles," said the court in its recent order.
