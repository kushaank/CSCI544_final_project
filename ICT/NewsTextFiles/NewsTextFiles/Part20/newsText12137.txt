
TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian share prices eased on Monday while European shares were called slightly higher as investors waited to see if the world's major central banks will continue to keep monetary policy easy and in some cases loosen further.

Spreadbetters see European shares eking out small gains, with France's CAC seen leading the gains with 0.2 percent rise and Germany's DAX expected to be gaining less than 0.1 percent.

Japan's Nikkei average succumbed to the regional weakness after initial gains, hitting one-month lows.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ticked down 0.3 percent, led by Australian shares falling 1.2 percent.

Indian shares extended their gains following an election victory last week by the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies, seen as more business-friendly than the outgoing Congress party.

"I think (the market) will remain choppy until we get some clear indications or more comfort around some of these high multiples. The key thing for a lot of investors here are these prices are a bit rich - is it being justified by earnings?" said John Milroy, investment adviser at Macquarie Bank.
