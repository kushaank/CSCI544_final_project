Reiterating the Resident Welfare Association’s (RWA) view, COMPAT has said that the realty major abused its dominant position in the Gurgaon market.

The Competition Appellate Tribunal (COMPAT) today dismissed DLF ’s appeal against the Rs 630 crore penalty levied on the company by the Competition Commission of India (CCI).

Reiterating the Resident Welfare Association’s (RWA) view, COMPAT has said that the realty major abused its dominant position in the Gurgaon market.

The DLF buyers association has hailed the move. It said that it will now seek compensation from DLF separately, while adding that there is no question of any settlement with the realty major.

A few years ago, the RWA of DLF's The Belaire project approached the CCI, saying the company misused its dominant position in the market by building more floors than it originally planned. This led to the CCI imposing a fine of Rs 630 crore on DLF that the company challenged but was today upheld by the COMPAT.

DLF has reacted to this development by saying that it will challenge the order.

“The Company wishes to point out that it has successfully delivered Park Place, Belaire and Magnolia projects which were the subject matter of the above appeals.  The Company has respected in true letter and spirit the customer commitments made by it. In testament thereof, out of over 2600 total number of apartments, over 2200 have been handed over, and over 1800 number of families are already residing therein,” the company stated.

KK Sharma, Former DG, Competition Commission of India says Justice Sirpurkar has given the COMPAT ruling based on the following aspects: higher super area being imposed on customers, common area becoming less, number of floor area going high. He further adds that the ruling may affect DLF’s other Gurgaon projects too.

On the quantum of the penalty, Naval Chopra, Partner, Amarchand Mangaldas, says he is surprised as the COMPAT itself had held that the penalty should be limited to the relevant market. “So, if the relevant market is Gurgaon it should be limited to DLF’s turnover in Gurgaon. That will be taken up in the Supreme Court when they are asking for a stay on the penalty,” adds Chopra.

• CCI had passed an order on August 12, 2011 after finding DLF abusing its dominant position.

• CCI had imposed a 630cr fine after its inquiries into complaints filed by flat buyer associations of two DLF projects in Gurgaon - DLF Park Palace and The Belaire.

• CCI order was then challenged by DLF before the tribunal which stayed the penalty and asked CCI to modify the buyers agreement.

• As per the direction of the tribunal , on 3rd Jan , 2013 , CCI passed an order amending the flat buyers agreement of DLF's Belaire.

• Later, it extended the modifications suggested by it to DLF's Park Place and Magnolia projects also through two separate orders on January 10.

• DLF contended that the fair trade regulator was directed by the tribunal only to propose the changes and not to pass a formal order.

On August 22, 2014, DLF closed at Rs 191.55, up Rs 0.65, or 0.34 percent. The 52-week high of the share was Rs 242.80 and the 52-week low was Rs 121.00.

The company's trailing 12-month (TTM) EPS was at Rs 2.52 per share as per the quarter ended June 2014. The stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was 76.01. The latest book value of the company is Rs 93.41 per share. At current value, the price-to-book value of the company is 2.05.
