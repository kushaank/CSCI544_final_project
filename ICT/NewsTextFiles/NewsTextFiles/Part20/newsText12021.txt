SHANGHAI--Chinese auto maker Great Wall Motor Co. said it would build a car plant in Russia that will have an annual expected capacity of 150,000 vehicles.

In a statement to the Hong Kong exchange Monday, the auto maker said it would enter into an agreement Tuesday with the government of Tula Oblast and the Tula Oblast Public-Private Partnership Development group, that will pave the way for it to build the factory, that will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Great Wall Motor.

Tula Oblast is located south of the Russian capital of Moscow.

Great Wall said investment in the first phase of investment will be around 2.1 billion yuan (around $340 million). The company said it would build a second phase depending on commercial performance of the project. Total investment could reach 3.2 billion yuan, the company said.

SHANGHAI--Chinese auto maker Great Wall Motor Co. is planning to build a car factory in Russia even as the auto maker faces setbacks building its brand at home and abroad.

In a statement to the Hong Kong exchange Monday, the company said it planned to invest an initial 2.1 billion yuan ($340 million) to establish a production base capable of producing up to 150,000 vehicles a year.

A second phase would be added if the first phase proved viable, the company said, bringing total investment to 3.2 billion yuan.

Great Wall said the factory, which it will wholly own, will be constructed in the Tula Oblast area of Russia, south of Moscow.

To pave the way for the new facility, the company will enter into an agreement Tuesday with the local government and its related investment-support agency.

In addition to Russia, Great Wall exports autos to countries including South Africa and Australia.

The company unveiled plans last month to expand production in Malaysia for local and export sales to other Southeast Asian nations.

In February, the Chinese auto maker known for its popular sport-utility vehicles, announced it was postponing a planned car factory in Thailand, citing political unrest in that country.

The original plan called for a $300 million investment in an SUV plant in the eastern Thai province of Rayong.

In an interview last summer, Wang Shihui, Great Wall's deputy general manager of exports, said Chinese car companies must succeed abroad if they want to survive in China. "You need brand and global scale," he said.

In China, the company recently faced challenges in launching its upscale SUV, the Haval H8.

Earlier this month Great Wall halted delivery of the vehicle, citing persistent quality issues.
