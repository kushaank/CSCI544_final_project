
Abuja: At least four people were killed in an explosion in Nigeria, media reported Monday.

A suspected car bomb ripped through a busy road in Sabon-Gari, a Christian- dominated area in the country's northern city of Kano, at around 9.30 p.m. Sunday when it was crowded with street hawkers and traders, a police spokesman told Xinhua.

The blast was so powerful it could be heard several miles away from the site, the spokesman said.

The victims were three men and a young girl.
