
Joan Orie Melvin leaves the Frick Building on Oct. 15, 2013, after a hearing Downtown before Judge Lester G. Nauhaus.

The questions a panel of three Pennsylvania Superior Court judges poses to lawyers for former state Supreme Court Justice Joan Orie Melvin on Tuesday could suggest their stance on at least some of the issues she raises in her appeal of her corruption convictions, a legal expert said.

âPeople who like to read tea leaves will want to listen carefully to what the judges say,â said University of Pittsburgh law professor John Burkoff.

Melvin's attorneys will argue before Superior Court Judges Paula Ott, Christine L. Donohue and John L. Musmanno in the Lawrence County Government Center in New Castle on Tuesday, the first of a two-day special session there.

Melvin, 58, of Marshall is appealing her conviction for using her Superior Court office to run her campaign for the state's highest court in 2003 and 2009.

The Allegheny County District Attorney's Office disputes each of the claims, defending the way Nauhaus operated his courtroom and the jury's verdict.

Burkoff said the prosecutors' response is typical.

Mike Manko, a spokesman for the district attorney's office, declined to comment. Lawyers for Melvin did not respond.

If the judges focus on a specific basis for an appeal, that could suggest how seriously they take certain aspects of the arguments, Burkoff said. If they're dismissive, that could show their stance, too, he said.

Nauhaus sentenced Melvin to serve three years of house arrest and ordered her to pay $128,000 in fines, restitution and court costs. He also ordered her to send a photograph of herself in handcuffs, with an apology written on it, to every judge in the state.

Nauhaus delayed Melvin's sentence last May when she filed her appeal so she would not receive credit for time served.

Melvin is one of three sisters from a powerful North Hills family convicted of using political office for personal gain.

Former state Sen. Jane Orie, 52, R-McCandless, was released from prison in February after serving the minimum of her 2Â½- to 10-year prison sentence on charges of forgery, conflict of interest and theft of services.

Janine Orie, 59, also of McCandless, a former Melvin staffer, was sentenced to one year of house arrest for her role in her sisters' schemes.
