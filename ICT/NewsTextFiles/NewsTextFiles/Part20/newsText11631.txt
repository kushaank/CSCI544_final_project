Now Film will co-produce the English-language version with "Pan's Labyrinth" producer Frida Torresblanco.

SEOUL — South Korean crime drama Hwayi: A Monster Boy will get a U.S. remake, with the creators of the original taking part in the production, Korea's Star News reported Monday.

Lee Jun-dong, head of the 2013 movie's production company Now Film, met U.S.-based Spanish producer Frida Torresblanco to discuss the co-production plans at the Cannes Film Festival. Torresblanco has been behind such works as the 2006 Oscar-winning fantasy Pan's Labyrinth.

Lee said he opted to co-produce the English-language version rather than sell rights to a remake as U.S. adaptations of successful Korean titles have often been disappointing.

"We have decided to take part in the production as a collaborator in order to ensure the quality of the remake, rather than simply handing over the storyline," said Lee.

Now Film will be setting up a limited liability company for the project before pursuing funding, casting and other decisions with American partners. It is expected to use a co-production format similar to the one used for Hollywood adaptation of Bong Joon Ho's The Host.

Hwayi is about a teenage boy raised by a band of criminals. One day he is forced to commit a crime and sets out to discover the truth about his past. The Showbox/Mediaplex film is directed by Jang Joon-hwan, who is best known for the cult film Save the Green Planet.
