
DES MOINES | Des Moines will host a statewide arts summit aimed at helping artists from across the state meet, collaborate and showcase Iowa’s cultural offerings.

It’s the first such meeting in at least a decade, said Mary Cownie, director of the Iowa Department of Cultural Affairs, who said the June 6 event would be considered a success if the statewide arts community becomes stronger.

“It’s really important that we’re listening to the needs” of the cultural sector, Cownie said Monday during Gov. Terry Branstad’s weekly news conference.

The summit, which will be held at the Community Choice Credit Union Convention Center, will include performances by the Ballet Quad-Cities, Parranderos Latin Combo from Des Moines and Working Group Theatre of Iowa City.

“The cultural arts continue to transform our communities by elevating our quality of life, generating economic growth and creating job opportunities not only for Iowans directly involved in the arts, but also for the skilled trades and the hospitality industry,” Branstad said.

The governor added that he was at the Tulip Festival in Orange City over the weekend and will be in Mason City this coming weekend for the North Iowa Band Festival Parade.

“What I’m trying to say is there are a lot of wonderful things to do in Iowa,” he said.

Cownie said the cost of the summit would be $10,000 to $15,000, but the state hoped to offset that with the price of attendance. Those attending may register until May 23 at iowaartssummit.com. The event costs $45 per person.
