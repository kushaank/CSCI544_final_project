
BANGALORE / ANANTAPUR / HYDERABAD: The Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh Police in a joint operation on Sunday arrested notorious robber Kunigal Giri and three of his associates, who are wanted in over 80 cases, most of them related to armed robbery and extortion.

The police claimed the accused were plotting to assassinate a prominent politician in Hyderabad, but refused to name the target citing security reasons. In a joint operation with the Hindupur police, a police team from Bangalore raided a house in Hindupur early Sunday and nabbed Giri alias Boss, (32) and his associates Govinda alias Govindaraju (27) of Magadi, Jagga alias Jagadish (25) of Tumkur and Vasu (26) of Kunigal in Tumkur district.

Giri tried to escape on a motorcycle, but fell and injured himself. He has been admitted to a hospital and is currently in the custody of the Hindupur police. When the Bangalore police were taking the other accused to Bangalore, Govinda tried to break free and attacked a police officer. In retaliation, the police opened fire and Govinda was injured in the knee and ankle. He has been admitted to a hospital in Bangalore.

Speaking to the media, Bangalore Police Commissioner Raghavendra H Auradkar said the accused had told the police they wanted to become famous across the country by targeting a prominent Andhra politician.

Back in Hyderabad, Police Commissioner Anurag Sharma told Express he had called up his counterpart in Bangalore. “No names of any politician have been mentioned by the accused,” he said. However, following reports that MIM leader Akbaruddin Owaisi was their target, party chief Asaduddin Owaisi met Anurag Sharma.

Sources said the commissioner assured Asad that there was nothing to suggest a threat to the life of his brother. However, the versions put out by the Bangalore and Hindupur police differed in details. The latter claimed Giri had met with an accident and they arrested him only in the hospital.
