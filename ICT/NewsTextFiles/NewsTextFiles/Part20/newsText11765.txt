
Relatives of BPO employee V. Umamaheshwara Rao (26), who died under mysterious circumstance at his workplace on Saturday night, alleged that it was not a suicide or accidental death, but a murder. They staged a protest in front of the gate of World Network Service (WNS), the company where he worked on Monday morning, demanding an inquiry into his death.

The techie, who was on night shift, was found lying on the ground by the security personnel at about 10.30 p.m. on Saturday. He was shifted to a private hospital by company staff, where he was declared brought dead.

According to the relatives of the deceased, the suspicion arose after the company people gave different versions. “There are at least three conflicting versions and that stirred our suspicion.

There may be an internal hand in his death and the company management is trying to dilute the case by projecting it as a suicide. Our son did not have any suicidal tendencies and he was happy,” said Umamaheshwar Rao’s father.

The relatives said that the management of the company has agreed to pay the benefits to family members, but they didn’t speak out on the circumstances that led to his death.

However, Three Town Police SHO K. Appalaraju, rubbished the murder claim and said that it was a genuine accidental death. “For some reason he had fallen from the terrace, where he had gone to smoke a cigarette.

The post-mortem report indicates that the entire impact was on one side of the body. That is why there were no head injuries and the internal parts such as ribs were badly damaged,” said the SHO.

In the post-mortem, contents of alcohol were also found in the stomach of the deceased, the SHO said.
