
A man suspected to be part of the notorious criminal gang in Kampala has been arrested after suspicious neighbours tipped off police.

Asuman Kizito, 29, of Nsiike I Zone, Ndeeba was arrested after residents got suspicious how he had sustained a deep cut on his wrist and refused to get treatment.

Residents told police Asuman was always locked up in his house and would never come out before nightfall.

Ndeeba police led by operations boss Sam Nabongho went to Kizito’s home where they found him nursing a rotting wound. He also wore a big watch to disguise the wound, though he was visibly in pain and was afraid to go to hospital.

On interrogation, Asuman told police his wrist was hacked during a robbery mission that went wrong.

He said he was trying to enter a resident’s house in Kibiri – Masajja using a master key when he got hacked.

Asuman also told police that he has been involved in various crimes including robbery and murder. He said he could not place the number of people who had fallen victim to his missions.

However Nabongho said according to what he told police Asuman could be a member of the notorious Kifeesi crew, a gang that terrorises city dwellers. He said his account of how he was hacked in Kibiri could be a ploy to disguise the truth.

The Ndeeba police boss, Alan Lugayampunzi, said they are going to investigate and know what exactly happened to the suspect.

Meanwhile the Kibiri boss, John Kibaro, when asked by this reporter if there was any case reported in the area pertaining to Asuman’s story he said there was none.
