
SEOUL, May 19 (Yonhap) -- POSCO, South Korea's top steelmaker, said Monday it will aim for an annual consolidated operational profit of 5 trillion won (US$4.9 billion) by the year 2016 and focus on financial stability to boost its global competitiveness.

Holding its first investor relations gathering since CEO Kwon Oh-joon took office in March, the company said it will strive for overall sales of 78 trillion won in the target year to give the steelmaker an operating profit rate of 6.4 percent and strengthen its core business area of steel manufacturing.

POSCO reported an operating profit of just under 3 trillion won with sales reaching 62 trillion won in 2013, for an operating profit rate of 4.8 percent.

Besides steel, POSCO said it will focus on other industrial materials and clean energy development as next generation "mega growth engines" that will allow it to fulfill the "POSCO the Great" corporate vision outlined by Kwon. The steelmaker said it wants to move into next generation fuel cells, energy storage and magnesium-based materials.

"The key goal for the future is to strive for growth based on internal stability and discard past practices of pushing only for expansion," the CEO told investors. He stressed the steelmaker will start reaping investment made in the past and prod all of its overseas operations in such places as Indonesia to become profitable by 2016.  Last year, some eight foreign POSCO affiliates lost money.

"Normalization is key as well as cost-cutting," Kwon emphasized.
