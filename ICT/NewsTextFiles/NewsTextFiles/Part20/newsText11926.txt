
On Saturday, a rape joke showed up on Hooters' official Facebook page. The restaurant chain said that it was the result of a hack, yet the photo isn't too far off from the kind of pictures the restaurant usually posts.

The caption under the photo of the woman in short shorts -- "EXHIBIT A: The proof that she was asking for it your Honour" -- perpetuates the old, misogynistic notion that women invite sexual assault by wearing the "wrong" clothing or acting the "wrong" way, putting the onus on the victim, not the perpetrator, to prevent rape.

About an hour after Elizabeth Plank, an editor at PolicyMic, called the restaurant out for its offensive "joke," Hooters distanced itself from the posting and responded by saying it had lost access to its Facebook page.

Hooters added that company representatives reached out to Facebook right away, but it took five hours for the post to be taken down.

The image in question does appear to be out of line with the rest of what Hooters puts up on Facebook. The restaurant mostly shares professional shots of employees and its food. The photo that the hackers shared took the form of the popular Internet meme of framing and captioning a photo like a motivational poster.
