
The VA has been caught with its pants down. VA medical centers all across the country are under investigation, a scandal that should not have happened.

Forty-plus veterans died while waiting up to 21 months to be seen by specialist doctors for various life-threatening illnesses at the VA medical center in Phoenix, Ariz. More deaths are also reported at other VAs nationwide. This is blatant mismanagement, if not criminal, under the supposedly watchful eye of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki.

Military veterans organization are calling for the secretary to be fired and prosecuted for mismanagement and to answer for these untimely deaths.

Likewise, Undersecretary for Health Dr. Robert Petzel and Undersecretary for Benefits Allison Hickey should resign or be immediately fired. The inspector general of the United States has been directed to conduct an investigation into the allegations brought upon the VA.

Retired Air Force Master Sgt. Paul E. Travis, a veterans advocate, said, âIt's time that all veterans unite to stop the mismanagement atrocity known as Veterans Affairs from further harming veterans.â Mr. Travis is well know among the veterans population.

John Paul Rossie, executive director of the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Association, asked Congress to conduct an investigation, citing the VA scandal.

Veterans are treated like pieces of meat. Often they are handed pills, narcotics for pain and antidepressants to calm them down, and then shoved out the door. Medically, this sort of action solves nothing.

Is this proper care for our veterans? I think not.

The American people should demand that Congress step in and stop the atrocities that take place at VA medical centers and demand that our veterans be properly cared for.

They gave their all for our country. We now need to give our all to them.
