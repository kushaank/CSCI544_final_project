Verizon Wireless has made improvements to its 4G LTE wireless network in several Kansas locations, including Wichita, that it says will boost network capacity.

The improvements will at least double the capacity of the high-speed wireless network, the company says, allowing more customers to simultaneously use the network in high-traffic areas.

Verizon says the improvements will be especially useful during times when a high volume of people are using the network in data-intensive ways at the same time, such as during a concert or sporting event.

Verizon calls the upgraded LTE network XLTE. More than half of markets with LTE networks have been boosted in this way.
