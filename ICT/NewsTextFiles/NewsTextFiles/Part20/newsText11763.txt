The Australian share market has closed higher as bargain hunters moved in following falls in morning trade.

The fortunes of the local market reversed in the second half of the day as traders looked overseas.

It came despite the iron ore price falling below $US100 per tonne.

"The Aussie market appears to have been on a frolic of its own compared to international markets," CMC analyst Ric Spooner said.

"A drop in the iron ore price created the atmospherics, and mining stocks came under pressure early, but this afternoon we've seen some old fashioned bargain hunting."

He said Asian markets generally performed well following a positive lead from Wall Street.

"Our market obviously felt a bit nervous about continuing to head in the opposite direction," he said.

Investors initially sold off mining stocks as they worried about the short term prospects of the steel making commodity, which is Australia's largest export.

The iron ore price fell under $US100 per tonne overnight for the first time since 2012, putting more pressure on the share market, where nearly half of the listed companies are in the resources sector.

The big miners finished mixed, with BHP Billiton up two cents at $37.45 but Rio Tinto down five cents at $60.05.

Fortescue Metals rose 17 cents to $4.54 after announcing a major increase in the size of its resources.

The banks were also mixed, with Commonwealth Bank up 27 cents at $79.83, Westpac down 10 cents at $33.68, National Australia Bank up 15 cents at $33.10 and ANZ nine cents higher at $32.75.

Defensive stocks and retailers were some of the only sectors in positive territory.

* At the close on Tuesday, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index was 11.4 points, or 0.21 per cent, higher at 5,420.4.
