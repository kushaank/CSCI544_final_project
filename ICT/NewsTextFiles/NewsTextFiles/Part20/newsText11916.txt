
Thatâ€™s significant because Beavercreek-based MacAulay-Brown was the only locally-based company named to the open competition side of OASIS, the government-wide professional services contract administered by General Services Administration that could be worth more than $60 billion over the next decade.

The company has about 2,000 employees, including 600 locally, and operates a National Capital Headquarters in Vienna, Va. It has been on a tear recently, which includes being named to two military contracts during the last 60 days with a combined value of nearly $1.8 billion.

Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus was the only other firm based in Ohio to be named to the open competition contract for OASIS.

Several other companies that have a Dayton-area presence â€” and therefore may win some work that will be done here â€” won open competition OASIS spots. That  includes Colorado-based Ball Aerospace , which has about 500 local workers, and Leidos, which has several hundred workers here.

In total, 200 business were named to both OASIS contracts.
