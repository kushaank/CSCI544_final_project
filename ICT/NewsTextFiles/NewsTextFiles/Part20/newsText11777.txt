
Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor may live a residence with Victorian-inspired landscaping in Fort Indiantown Gap in Lebanon County, about 23 miles from the state capitol.

The way John Kennedy sees it, two kinds of people run for lieutenant governor.

In the first batch are the newcomers, the citizens who dream of running for office and bypass local government. They campaign, and by and large, they lose.

âThe worst thing that could happen to them, they get a tour of 67 counties in the commonwealth,â said Kennedy, a former Republican lawmaker from Cumberland County who ran for the seat in 2010.

Five Democrats, all of whom have experience as public officials, are seeking the nomination on Tuesday: former U.S. Rep. Mark Critz of Johnstown; Harrisburg City Councilman Brad Koplinski; state Rep. Brandon Neuman of Canonsburg; Bradford County Commissioner Mark Smith; and state Sen. Mike Stack of Philadelphia.

Lieutenant governor is the state's second-highest seat, and first in the line of succession if the governor's office becomes vacant. The race attracts all stripes of Pennsylvanians, from furniture makers to county commissioners, and has a history of being a wide-open field.

It has a history of not leading to higher office, at least not the way it does elsewhere.

Julia Hurst, executive director with the National Lieutenant Governors Association, said lieutenant governors become governor at a greater rate than any other type of elected official â 1 in 4 nationwide from 1980 through 2006.

âNo other office is more of a springboard office than the office of lieutenant governor,â she said.

In Pennsylvania, only four men became governor since 1900 â all Republicans â after serving as lieutenant governor. Raymond Shafer was elected in 1967 after serving as lieutenant governor under Gov. Bill Scranton. Arthur James ascended to the higher office in 1939. Mark Schweiker ascended to the job when Gov. Tom Ridge resigned to become the first Secretary of the federal Department of Homeland Security. He did not seek election. Lt. Gov. John C. Bell became the state's shortest-serving governor for 19 days in 1947, when Gov. Edward Martin resigned his term to serve in the U.S. Senate.

The job has constitutional duties as president of the Senate and chair of the Board of Pardons â and special assignments at the governor's discretion. The officeholder receives free housing at a Victorian-inspired home in Fort Indiantown Gap, a salary of about $160,000 and seven employees, according to state data.

Responsibilities are diverse across the 45 states where it exists, Hurst said.

Occasionally, state legislatures will look to ax the job in cost-cutting measures. Illinois had such a movement last spring, with lawmakers citing a $2 million budget for the office. Hurst said any state that has gotten rid of the office reinstated it.

Kennedy said he would support eliminating the role from state government. Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor's office is budgeted at $814,000 this fiscal year. When he ran, he had an agenda: He was starting Citizens Alliance of Pennsylvania, his nonprofit government reform group.

âBy serving there, I would've had a public forum to grow CAP,â he said.

Lt. Gov. Jim Cawley won the Republican nomination with 26 percent of the vote among a pack of nine candidates that year. Coming in second was Chet Baker, a gazebo manufacturer from Lancaster County. Jean Craige Pepper, an Erie County businesswoman active in Republican politics, was the lone female candidate of the bunch.

She trademarked her campaign with bright yellow campaign signs that pictured a red chili â âPick a Pepper at the pollâ â and landed in sixth place. Pennsylvania gives a home field advantage to statewide candidates running for office by listing their counties on the ballot: Pepper won 66 percent of Erie, and majorities in surrounding Crawford, Warren and Forest counties.

âWhen there are so many people running, you can potentially win with as little as 22 percent of the vote,â she said.

This year's fight remained competitive, if under the radar, in the final stretch. No candidate received the party's endorsement, which requires a two-thirds committee vote. Koplinski took about half.

Harper Polling last week found Stack in the lead with 20 percent support, followed by Critz at 18 percent; 42 percent were undecided.
