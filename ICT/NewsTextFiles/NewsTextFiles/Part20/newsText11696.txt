A second man has been arrested in connection with an armed home invasion that occurred on Thursday.

A one-car crash claimed the lives of three people over the weekend. The driver, 23-year-old Jonathan Cruz, sped out of the Salt Lake International Airport parking lot around 5 a.m. on Saturday.

The car crashed and rolled several times near the I-215 on-ramp, coming to rest on its roof in the weeds, according to UHP.

The two back-seat passengers were juveniles and their names have not been released. The front-seat passenger was identified as Michaela Martin, 18, of Taylorsville. The three passengers were killed. The driver, Cruz, remained hospitalized in serious but stable condition as of Sunday evening, according to police.

Karl Winsness of Kearns is paying it forward — literally.

Winsness was convicted of shooting and nearly killing a Salt Lake County sheriff’s deputy in 1988. He spent nearly 20 years in prison as a result, and saw the effect it had on his daughters. Since he was released in 2004, Winsness has started a scholarship for children with inmate parents. Most of the money comes out of his own pocket.
