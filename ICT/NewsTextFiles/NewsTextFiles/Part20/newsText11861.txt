
OAO Mechel (MTLR) Chief Financial Officer Stanislav Ploschenko, who was leading talks between the mining company that’s one of Russia’s most indebted and its lenders, will step down after seven years working in the position.

Ploschenko, 37, will be replaced by Andrey Slivchenko, Mechel said today in a statement. Slivchenko, 38, joined Mechel in April after heading Pharmacy Chain 36.6 in 2011 and 2012, and working as vice-president in the state United Aircraft Corp.

“This news is very sensitive and rather negative for the company as Ploschenko was a key figure in refinancing talks,” George Buzhenitsa, a Deutsche Bank AG analyst, said by phone.

Chief Executive Officer Evgeny Mikhel quit at the end of December for his own reasons, Mechel said at the time. He was replaced by Oleg Korzhov. The company declined to give a reason for Ploschenko’s departure.

Russia’s largest producer of coking coal for steelmakers last week said its 2013 net loss widened to $2.9 billion, from $1.7 billion, after prices fell and the Moscow-based company wrote down more than $2 billion. It had net debt of $8.7 billion at the end of 2013 and got waivers from lenders in November and December after talks led by Ploschenko.

Mechel’s global depository receipts fell 2.8 percent to $2.06 by 11:27 a.m. in New York. Its shares closed at 47.40 rubles in Moscow after losing almost 60 percent of their value in a year.
