Garcetti and Blumenfield visited businesses large and small alike from Topanga Canyon Boulevard east to Sherman Way, including a visit to La Reyna de Michoacan, a Mexican kosher ice creamery at 7147 Lindley Avenue in Reseda, as well as a tour of the Tarzana Village Walk at Ventura Boulevard and Yolanda Avenue.

The two officials discussed combining city funds for median planning to create more pedestrian- and business-friendly areas, as well as plans to cut city business taxes to jump-start economies on smaller “Main Streets” citywide.

The mayor also took an opportunity at La Reyna de Michoacan to savor the Valley’s unique character.

“Only in LA could you get kosher Mexican ice cream made by a Chilean,” he said.

Blumenfield also recommended making better use of older Community Redevelopment Agency properties to help launch small businesses that are critical to bringing jobs to area residents.
