
Three TECH Forth Worth  Acceleration Clients were recently awarded IMPACT Awards by the organization. The awards are designed to highlight the innovative work and the impact of emerging technology start-ups in the North Texas region.

The ceremony, which took place at Texas Christian University, also recognized Michael Dell, the founder of legendary Round Rock, Texas-based Dell Computers.

This year’s IMPACT winners were E3 Water LLC, Surgery Link, and  E-Mist Innovations , a biotech company also funded and supported by the  Cowtown Angels Program .

E3 is a company working on improving water. Their goal is to achieve the best water quality and availability possible with a mobile wastewater treatment technology. The company’s innovative technology was recognized by TECHFW, which facilitated a collaboration with University of Texas-Arlington and the federal government.

SurgeryLink is responsible for the development of the first HIPAA-secure platform. The platform addresses the needs of the surgical community by providing surgeons and administrators with a reliable communication and scheduling system that reduces error and cancellations, thus improving the safety and reliability of surgical procedures for patients. While the technology is still being tested in a selected group, it will soon be released to the entire surgical community.

Darlene Boudreaux, Tech Forth Worth Executive Director, said at this year’s ceremony that IMPACT’s influence in the North Texas biotech community continues to expand, both for the organization and its laureates. “Tech Fort Worth’s influence continues to grow as does the potential for achieving measurable successes,” she said.

TECHFW is a nonprofit organization sponsored by several private and public institutions.
