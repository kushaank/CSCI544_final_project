
Eighty-two-year old Mary Margaret Yourchik was robbed of far more than her purse in the parking lot of a Fayette County Wal-Mart, according to the late woman's children.

Her hip was broken in three places when she was shoved to the pavement, so Yourchik could no longer drive herself to see relatives in Ohio.

She never walked again without assistance. She couldn't live alone. She needed help with tasks as simple as putting on her socks and shoes, Yourchik's daughter testified during a sentencing hearing on Monday for one of two sisters accused in the mugging.

At night, fear overtook her mother, an emotional Kathleen Yourchik testified before Brittany Boyd's sentencing.

Mary Yourchik suffered a stroke less than three months after she was mugged, her children said. She died in November.

Boyd, 25, and her sister, Jenna Boyd, 26, both of North Union, were charged in connection with the March 22, 2013, mugging.

Judge Steve Leskinen sentenced Brittany Boyd to nine to 20 years in pri-son. Brittany Boyd on May 6 pleaded guilty to robbery, aggravated assault and other charges.

Yourchik's family watched the crime on a computer screen on Monday in a video surveillance tape supplied by Wal-Mart.

Jenna Boyd faces trial on a different set of charges. Police said she was in the car when her sister grabbed Yourchik's purse before the two sisters sped off with their young children in the backseat.

Another of Yourchik's children, Julie Grubb, testified that if the Boyd sisters had asked, her mother would have given them money.

Brittany Boyd offered a tearful apology.

She described how her decision to get high will rob her of the opportunity to be with her children. In a previous court hearing, she said she was addicted to heroin and had gone to the Wal-Mart to wait for a drug dealer.

Leskinen noted that Brittany Boyd has been in trouble with the law since she was 16.

Leskinen said he imposed a sentence in the aggravated range because of Boyd's prior convictions and Yourchik's age.

Kathleen Yourchik said after the hearing that while she and her siblings are satisfied with the sentence, everyone involved suffered losses.

Jenna Boyd, who is free on bond, will stand trial on charges of criminal conspiracy, theft, child endangerment and unsworn falsification to authorities.
