
Raytheon Canada has secured a multi-year contract for operations and maintenance of the joint US and Canadian radar system, North Warning System (NWS).

Awarded by the Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC), the contract requires the Raytheon subsidiary to provide operations and maintenance for the NWS and also assume full care, custody and control of the NWS and its components for the next five years.

The contract, which also includes two options totalling an additional five years, covers 47 radar sites, five logistics support sites, a monitoring and control centre, and a radar depot.

Raytheon Canada NWS programme manager Pierre LeBlanc said the contract win was based on the provision of the best solution at the best value and the company's Inuit Benefit offering.

"The surveillance information is relayed to the NORAD Combat Operations Centre at Colorado, for further action."

"RCL brings training as a core competency to develop a high technology work force in the north," LeBlanc said.

Having partnered Canadian Base Operations in bidding for the contract, the company will be maintaining the sites to ensure continuous radar surveillance over northern Canada in support of the defence of North American and Canadian sovereignty.

Comprising both long range AN/FPS-117 and short range AN/FPS-124 surveillance radars, the NWS provides surveillance of airspace from potential incursions or attacks from across North America's polar region, providing a command and control capability to the Canadian Air Defence Sector of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).

The stations are controlled by the Alaska Regional Operations Control Center (ROCC) at Elmendorf Air Force Base, in Alaska, US, and by the Canada East and Canada West Regional Operations Control Centres (ROCCs) at CFB North Bay, Ontario. The surveillance information is relayed to the NORAD Combat Operations Centre at Colorado, for further action.
