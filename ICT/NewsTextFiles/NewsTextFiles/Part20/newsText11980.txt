
The main domestic risk to financial stability in the UK and therefore to the durability of the expansion centres on the housing market, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney told Sky News on Sunday.

That is the result of the "deep, deep" structural problems in the market, chiefly a lack of adequate supply. Twice the number of homes is built in his native Canada each year than in Britain, he pointed out.

"We're not going to build a single house at the Bank of England and we can't influence that," Carney said.

In fact, the Bank is studying the possibility of recommending that banks set more stringent limits on the size of loans as a percentage of people's incomes.

"The level of higher loan-to-income mortgages, ones above four and a half, five times loan-to-income, potentially could store up bigger problems for the future and we need to be careful," the Governor added.

However, the central banker also emphasised the need to be "calibrated" and "proportionate" in any new requirements set on banks.

The Bank of England is also checking the government's Help-to-Buy programme. Although it is a relatively small and targeted programme it may grow a lot and affect other parts of the mortgage market, "that's why we have to be vigilant," he sentenced.

Lastly, and as regards other potential threats to the economy, Carney mentioned weak demand in the Eurozone, and the persistent strength of sterling. As well, low levels of volatility in financial markets may pick up, leading to a rise in borrowing costs.
