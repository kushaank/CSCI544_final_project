
Pune: Have you spent thousands on a mobile phone recently, only to find that you are being meted out poor post-sale services from the company or the service centre? In case you face trouble getting your phone repaired or replaced, you can file a complaint against the mobile phone company in the consumer court, just like two citizens of Pune.

The District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum recently addressed two similar cases against mobile phone manufacturers and service providers for providing inadequate service and unresponsive behaviour.

In both cases, the complainants had purchased phones that started throwing software issues in a few months' time. The first case had been filed by Aditya Shah, a resident of Aundh, against Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications Pvt Ltd (now Sony mobile communications) and My Mobile Shoppe. Having bought a phone in May 2012, it started giving trouble within four months of use, and was not being repaired or replaced either by the phone manufacturer or service provider. Though the opponents argued saying that the mobile was beyond repair due to mishandling, they did not have any documentation for the same. The court has issued an order in favour of the consumer, where the company was told to pay the whole amount of the mobile phone, along with compensation for mental and physical harassment.
