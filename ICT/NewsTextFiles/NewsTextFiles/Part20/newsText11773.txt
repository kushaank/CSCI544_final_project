
SEOUL â South Korea's president pledged on Monday to disband the coast guard amid mounting criticism of its failure to save hundreds of passengers trapped last month in a sinking ferry.

The country's coast guard is a nonmilitary agency and does not patrol the maritime frontier with North Korea, which is done by the navy. Still, a move to abolish the independent coast guard in a peninsula country surprised many.

Critics said President Park Geun-hye was trying to shift attention from her mishandling of one of South Korea's deadliest disasters in decades.

The agency has dealt with withering criticism that it acted slowly and unprofessionally in botched rescue and search efforts. The April 16 sinking left more than 300 people dead or missing.

Park's first televised address to the nation since the sinking began with a deep bow and ended with her tearfully reading the names of passengers and crew who died trying to save others. With her approval ratings plummeting before mayoral and governor elections in about two weeks, the speech sought to acknowledge widespread anger over government failures as well as chart a path forward.

Most of the victims were students from a high school near Seoul who were traveling to the southern tourist island of Jeju.

âThe ultimate responsibility for not properly dealing with this incident is mine,â Park said.
