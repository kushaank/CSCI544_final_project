
MERRILLVILLE | Two Lake Station men allegedly broke into a construction company's property May 13 and stole an industrial air compressor and a trailer.

Lonnie Chabes, 41, and Robert Maldonado, 33, were charged with felony theft and misdemeanor criminal mischief in Lake Criminal Court.

Merrillville police were sent to the 8700 block of Louisiana Street after a report of a suspicious silver SUV in that area.

En route to the scene, a Merrillville officer saw a silver Ford SUV matching the description of the suspicious vehicle. The SUV, which was towing a trailer carrying an industrial air compressor, was stopped on U.S. 30 near an Interstate 65 entrance ramp.

According to court documents, Chabes was driving the vehicle and Maldonado was a passenger.

The documents state Chabes indicated he picked up the compressor, and he often uses his SUV to tow the item.

An officer asked Maldonado where they were traveling from, and he allegedly told police "whatever he was doing is on him."

The owner of the construction company confirmed the compressor and trailer belong to his business. He also told police Chabes and Maldonado never worked for his company.

Security camera footage at the business shows a silver SUV driving past the business multiple times before the vehicle eventually stopped at the property.

The driver and passenger of the SUV broke a chain on a gate, returned to the vehicle and left the area, court documents state.

The vehicle later returned. According to court documents, the driver and passenger entered the property and connected the trailer carrying the air compressor to the SUV before the vehicle drover out of the lot.
