
USA based Verizon Wireless has announced that it is doubling the bandwidth available on its LTE based network in key hotspots where demand is highest.

Reading between the lines, it appears to be a roll out of carrier aggregation,  which has been deployed on a number of other networks.

Verizon said that compatible smartphones will automatically access both  700MHz spectrum and the AWS spectrum. Customers with LTE devices operating  solely on the 700MHz spectrum in upgraded markets also benefit from the extra  capacity created by traffic moving to the AWS spectrum.

The company has chosen to brand the service differently from its standard 4G  network, and is calling it XLTE.

Nearly all of the devices Verizon Wireless sells are XLTE Ready when  purchased. The company said that more than 35 percent of all devices operating  on the Verizon Wireless network can take direct advantage of the added capacity  that AWS provides.
