ShopVisible , a SaaS commerce platform provider, is proud to be a top sponsor and exhibit its B2B innovations at the annual IRCE Focus: Brands & B2B conference. The event, held May 18-20, 2014 in New York, will feature insights into direct-to-consumer relationship management, channel complexity and digital marketing. As a silver sponsor, ShopVisible’s leadership and eCommerce experts will be on hand in booth #106 to share best practices and industry-leading retail technology solutions.

As eCommerce technology rapidly advances, companies must recognize their customers’ changing needs. Traditionally, business buyers were addressed differently than their consumer counterparts. But today, customers simply won't accept substandard B2B experiences. Business buyers are increasingly influenced by the omnichannel revolution they experience as consumers - and are demanding the same experiences professionally.
