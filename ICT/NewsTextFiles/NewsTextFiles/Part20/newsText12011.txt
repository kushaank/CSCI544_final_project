
Russia and China are due to sign a long-awaited gas contract on Tuesday, in which Beijing could pay up to $456 billion for Russian gas over the next 30 years.

While Russian President Vladimir Putin visits Shanghai on May   20-21, Gazprom and the China National Petroleum Corporation   (CNPC) are due to sign a deal for 38 billion cubic meters of   natural gas to power China's growing economy, starting in 2018.

The timing is almost flawless as Russia is looking to shield   itself from Western sanctions by pivoting towards Asia, and China   desperately needs to switch from dirty coal to more   environmentally friendly natural gas.

â€œThe arrangements on export of Russian natural gas to China   have nearly been finalized. Their implementation will help Russia   to diversify pipeline routes for natural gas supply, and our   Chinese partners to alleviate the concerns related to energy   deficit and environmental security through the use of â€˜cleanâ€™   fuel,â€� President Vladimir Putin said.

The deal has been on the table for over 10 years, as Moscow and   Beijing have negotiated back and forth over price, the gas   pipeline route, and possible Chinese stakes in Russian projects.   The gas price is expected to be agreed at between $350-400 per   thousand cubic meters. In January Gazprom gave an estimate   between $360-$400 per 1,000 cubic meters but now Russian   newspaper Izvestia has cited a Gazprom employee forecasting a   lower range between $350-$380 per 1,000 cubic meters.

â€œOf course Russia wants to sell gas and resources at the   highest possible prices. But because of the sanctions from   European partners, we need to find a partner that can buy our gas   long-term, which is why at the moment China looks very attractive   to us,â€� Aleksandr Prosviryakov, a partner at Lakeshore   International, a Moscow-based asset management firm, told RT at a   Confederation of Asia Pacific Chambers of Commerce and Industry   (CACCI) in Moscow ahead of the big meeting on Tuesday.

On Sunday, Gazprom chief Aleksey Miller sat down with his CNPC   counterpart, Zhou Jiping, in Beijing to discuss final details,   including price formulas.

But the sticking point is how to finish the pipeline from Russia   to China.

Currently there is one complete gas pipeline that runs throughout   Russia to the Chinese border, â€œSiberian Powerâ€� which Gazprom   broke ground on in 2007, three years after Gazprom and CNPC   signed a strategic cooperation agreement in 2004.

The pipeline stretches across Russiaâ€™s Far East and after   extension to China, it will deliver gas to the countryâ€™s populous   north, near Beijing.

Gas could be delivered via Vladivostok, Russiaâ€™s eastern port   city on the Sea of Japan, or through the city of Blagoveshchensk,   an landlocked city in the Amur region.

However, to finish the project for 2018 delivery, Gazprom and   CNPC need to come to an agreement on how to finish the proposed   portion of the pipeline into China, which could cost between   $22-30 billion, according to various estimates. Russia wants   China to either pay or issue a loan for the project, which has   been a delaying factor in talks.

In 2009, Beijing and Moscow signed a deal that Gazprom would   supply China with 30 billion cubic meters of gas a year by 2015,   but via the Altai pipeline, which would deliver gas to Chinaâ€™s   Western Xinjiang province. Russia stopped work on this project in   2013 and prioritized the â€˜Power of Siberiaâ€™ line. If and when   both pipelines are activated, Russia could be pumping 68 billion   cubic meters of gas annually to the worldâ€™s second largest   economy.

Home to nearly 1.5 billion people, Chinaâ€™s demand for energy is   rising faster than ever. In 2014, the country expects to increase   natural gas imports by 20 percent, and import 186 billion cubic   meters annually.

â€œThis deal with Gazprom and cooperation with Russia shows   that China is expanding, becoming bigger and bigger, and that   this part of the world is dominated by China, India, and Russia,   the US role is shrinking,â€� said Aleksandr Prosviryakov.

â€œChina is the fastest growing economy. China is the biggest   market in terms of volume and value. China is the next superpower   and number one economy in the world,â€� Peter Panov, Chairman   of Triotoni, a Singapore-based investment firm, told RT at the   CACCI conference in Moscow.

Russiaâ€™s Deputy Energy Minister Anatoly Yanovsky has said the   deal is 98 percent ready . China has kept quiet on the subject.

â€œNow is the time for Russia to compromise a little bit so   that they can lessen their dependence on Western Europe as a   buyer of Russian gas. Diversification is a strategy for Russia to   have good long-term business relationships with both Europe and   China,â€� Benedicto Yujuico, president of the Confederation of   Asia-Pacific Chambers of Commerce and Industry, told RT at an   Asian business gathering in Moscow on Wednesday.

â€œNeedless to say, China is a very wise nation and will try   and get the best out of both parties, and maneuver: give a little   bit to Russia, and a little to the West,â€� Panov said.

Gas is an important element of the upcoming talks, but the   leaders will discuss many aspects of Russia-China relations,   including payments systems, military cooperation, and upcoming   infrastructure projects.

A record amount of agreements are expected to be signed at the   working meeting between Russia and China. Already 30 out of the   43 prepared agreements are expected to be inked, according to   presidential aide Yury Ushakov, as reported by RIA Novosti.
