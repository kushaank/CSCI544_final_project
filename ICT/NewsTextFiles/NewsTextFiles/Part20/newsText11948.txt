
After contacting numerous environmental groups who espouse concern over clean air, I experienced directly their hypocrisy when it comes to the source of pollution. In the name of climate change, movie stars are concerned that you canâ€™t see the sun in Indonesia and Brazil due to slash and burn. Yet permanent road signs in Oklahoma due to field burning say, turn on headlights when smoke is present.

Black carbon, mercury and particulates are harmful if they come from car exhaust or a coal-fired power plant, but apparently no problem when it comes from thousands of acres of U.S. Forest Service control and accelerant laden slash pile burns. I challenge climate scientists, movie stars and environmentalists to display the same outrage against slash and burn in our own country. Recent research reveals these small low temperature control burns release alkaloids that are toxic to humans and our ecosystems. Much more so than large wildfires.

Movie stars concerned that wildfires are occurring due to climate change never mention how dense and dry our forests have become due to micromanagement and lawsuits from environmental groups. The civilized way to prevent wildfires is responsible thinning, grazing and air tankers/helicopters for immediate fire control.
