
Carden Bank Rest Home, Belvedere Road.

BOSSES at a residential home in Burton have insisted its patients receive care of the highest order after it was instructed to make improvements by the Care Quality Commission (CQC).

Carden Bank Rest Home, in Belvedere Road, failed in three out of five areas after being inspected by the health watchdog.

One patient had an order on their file that they should not be resuscitated in the event of their heart stopping, but the CQC was told by staff the patient did not have the mental capacity to make that decision.  It found a capacity assessment on the patient had not been completed.

The body also said no action was taken regarding an underweight woman at the home until she was taken ill.

But bosses said the home had since been re-inspected and were awaiting the publication of a new report confirming it was now meeting all expected standards.

The most recent report available, which has been published following an inspection in October 2013, ordered the centre to take action to improve regarding consent to care and treatment, care and welfare of people who use the services and how it  assesses and monitors the quality of service provision.

Ms Akhtar refuted the CQCâ€™s claims that action was not taken quickly enough in the case of the underweight patient.

She said bosses had learned from the findings of the inspection.
