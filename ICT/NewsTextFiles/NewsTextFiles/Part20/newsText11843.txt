
FRANKFURT — Deutsche Bank said a decision to seek €8bn in new equity capital was driven by uncertainty about the cost of new regulations and the need for funds to expand its investment banking business.

Germany’s largest bank unveiled the capital raising late on Sunday, bringing in Qatar’s royal family as a major new investor. It plans to sell the new shares and at least €1.5bn in additional hybrid debt by June 4.

It gives Deutsche Bank firepower for the investment banking drive, especially in the US, after a retreat by competitors Barclays, UBS and others left a gap that it aims to fill as Europe’s top debt trader.

But it also underscores how the bank fell short of ambitious turnaround targets and how burdensome fines and settlements and lagging profitability have hampered management’s efforts to fortify capital by retaining earnings.

"We need some buffer to protect on the regulations," said the bank’s finance chief Stefan Krause.

In a research note, Nomura analysts said the scale of the capital raising, combined with first-quarter results that fell by a third, "suggests that investors may express some caution about what may have changed to act as a catalyst".

Shares in Deutsche Bank fell 2.3% in early trading, their lowest since April last year, before recovering to trade down 0.85%, in line with European rivals.

"Whilst longer term this could put market concerns on capital to rest — which have led to an ongoing valuation discount — the capital increase is larger than expected," said Credit Suisse analysts.

The new money helps the bank bolster the capital ratios used by regulators as the European Central Bank runs the region’s top banks through rigorous checks before it becomes the eurozone’s leading banking watchdog in November.

A stake worth €1.75bn has already been placed with an investment vehicle owned and controlled by Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabor Al-Thani of Qatar, Deutsche Bank said on Sunday. It plans to raise another €6.3bn in a rights issue to existing shareholders.

The Qatari investor has not requested a seat on the board, nor were any special fees offered to the investor, a source close to the transaction said. "They’re an investor like anyone else," he said.

Deutsche Bank said it would focus on an "accelerated growth programme" by hiring top bankers in the US, investing some €200m over three years on technology improvements to its retail operations in Germany and Europe, and will hire up to 100 advisers to support its biggest corporate clients.

It also aims to expand its wealth management team in key emerging markets by 15% over three years.

"This should allow Deutsche Bank to take advantage of increasing consolidation in global investment banking," said Citibank analysts. They affirmed a "buy" rating for the bank’s stock.

The capital measures will increase Deutsche Bank’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio, a measure of a bank’s ability to withstand stress, by about 230 basis points, from 9.5% at the end of the first quarter of this year to 11.8%.

That is closer to the level held by rivals such as UBS, which last posted a CET1 measure of 13.2%.

Credit Suisse last posted a ratio of 10.0%, which is due to rise to over 16% due to regulatory requirements by 2019.
