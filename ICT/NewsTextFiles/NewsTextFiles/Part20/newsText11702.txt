JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – A recent diamond drilling campaign at the Faré South prospect of Aim-listed Stratex International’s 472.5 m2 Dalafin gold project, in Senegal, has extended mineralisation to over 500 m, remaining open along strike to the north-east, south-west and at depth.

Commenting on the results, CEO Bob Foster said the deepest drill hole intersected a number of well-mineralised but relatively narrow zones between 110 m and 190 m vertically below the surface, which continued to reinforce the project’s potential.

Meanwhile, at the southern end of Faré South, the long intersection returned by the deepest hole indicated that the mineralised corridor extended a further 100 m to the south-west of the prospect's previously known limits.

Latest results from Faré South included 10 m at 4.31 g/t of gold, 23.5 m at 1.41 g/t of gold and 19.5 m at 1.08 g/t of gold.

“It is possible that we are dealing with more than one mineralised system here and we have now commissioned an induced polarisation survey to assist us in directing the next phase of the drilling programme,” he said in a statement on Monday.

Drilling continued at the Madina Bafé prospect, in the south of the Dalafin licence, and the company expected to release the results within the next two months.

The Dalafin gold licence is Stratex's principal asset in Senegal, into which the company had earned 75% under the terms of a joint venture with a private Senegalese company EMC.

Located in south-eastern Senegal, Dalafin is positioned in the centre of the Birimian-age Kédougou-Kenieba gold belt, which extends from eastern Senegal into western Mali and had already seen multiple major gold discoveries.
