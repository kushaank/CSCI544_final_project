Prelert launched four years ago and is based outside Beantown, in Framingham, Mass. It also has an office in London. The company raised $3.7 million in venture funding in 2010. Since that time, it has been surviving — and thriving — on its own revenues.

Prelert has been releasing new products since it launched.
