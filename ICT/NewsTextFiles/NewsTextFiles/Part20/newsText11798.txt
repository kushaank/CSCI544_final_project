
OBRENOVAC, Serbia â Serbia ordered the evacuation on Monday of this town and 11 others along the raging Sava River, but Bratislava Pavlovic won't budge, even as water rising 6 feet in an hour lapped outside her third-floor apartment.

The worst rainfall in more than a century has flooded large swathes of Bosnia and Serbia, threatening Serbia's main power plant and unleashing landslides that have swept away homes and unearthed land mines left over from the region's war, along with warning signs pinpointing their locations.

At least 35 people have died, and tens of thousands have been forced to flee their homes.

In Obrenovac, shop windows were shattered, and children's bicycles, bedding, chairs and car tires were scattered in the streets. Dogs abandoned by their owners roamed about in packs as security forces distributed drinking water and food to the few remaining residents.

âIt came like a big wave,â Pavlovic said of the churning floodwaters that inundated the town of 15,000 about 20 miles south of the capital, Belgrade, when the Sava overflowed.

âIt happened in one hour, 2 meters of water. Nobody saw it coming,â said Pavlovic, whose two sons and their families were among those who fled.

In Bosnia, Foreign Minister Zlatko Lagumdzija called the flood damage âimmenseâ and compared it to the carnage during the country's 1992-95 war that killed at least 100,000 people and left millions homeless. He said the flooding had destroyed about 100,000 houses and 230 schools and hospitals, and left a 1 million without drinking water.

âThe only difference from the war is that less people have died,â he said. âThe country is devastated. ... This is something that no war in the history of this countryâ ever accomplished.
