
TORONTO, ONTARIO -- (Marketwired) -- 05/18/14 --   Teranet President and CEO Elgin Farewell, and Lawrence Franco, President of Value Added Commercial Solutions at Teranet, jointly announced that as of May 15, 2014, an affiliated entity to the company has acquired an interest in Foster Moore International Limited (FMIL), a New Zealand based global market player in the government registry sector.

As an international leader, developer and implementer of online registry solutions including Business, Secured Transaction, and Occupational Registries, the Foster Moore business gained credibility in the registry industry with its strong products, domain expertise, and through a successful relationship with its foundational client, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Enterprise (MBIE) in New Zealand. FMIL's Catalyst Registry Product is among the best Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) registry products in the world, which can be easily configured to meet the full and unique needs of each jurisdiction. The Catalyst Registry Product ensures speedy and cost-effective deployment, significant operational efficiencies, and a superior user experience.

FMIL holds major government contracts in New Zealand, North America, and South East Asia. FMIL will continue to operate as an independent company with no anticipated impacts to customers of Teranet or FMIL.

An investment in FMIL creates significant strategic value for Teranet, enhancing its value proposition to governments. This investment grants Teranet direct access to capabilities that complement Teranet's end-to-end statutory registry service delivery capabilities and direct access to technologies that can expedite the modernization of registry systems for governments.

"We are excited to work with an organization like Foster Moore, who has clearly demonstrated their expertise in the registry space," said Lawrence Franco, President of Value Added Commercial Solutions at Teranet. "This will certainly allow Teranet to extend its service delivery capabilities beyond Land, Writs, and the Personal Property Registries by creating access to technology that transforms Business, Secured Transaction, and Occupational Registries."

"This strategic investment with Teranet is fantastic for Foster Moore and we are all looking forward to building our future together. This partnership will help Foster Moore move towards becoming the leading corporate registry supplier globally," said Joel Foster, Chief Executive of Foster Moore International Limited. "With this relationship, Foster Moore and Teranet can leverage our experience and expertise to significantly extend the scalability of our businesses in terms of delivery and geographic regions."

This investment follows the recent announcement of Teranet's acquisition of The Property Registry in Manitoba, highlighting Teranet's commitment to expand its registry expertise to different jurisdictions.
