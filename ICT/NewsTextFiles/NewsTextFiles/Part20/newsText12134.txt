
SAN DIEGO--( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Promptlink        Communications Inc. , a leading solutions provider to broadband        network providers, today announced release of the Promptlink Set-Top Box        Test Platform™ (STBTP). Similar to other Promptlink test solutions, the        STBTP product performs a complete functional test of all video and audio        features of a digital set-top box, and is designed to be used by        non-technical personnel.

Promptlink will be exhibiting at Angacom in Cologne, Germany, May 20 through May 22 in Hall 10.1 booth V20.

The Promptlink Set Top Box Test Platform (STBTP) currently supports        testing of DVB-C and IP-based set-top boxes, and can test 16 units per        system in parallel in as little as five minutes. The system is currently        in use and operating 24/7 in multiple locations.

The STBTP system is used to test any DVB-C digital set-top equipment,        from any manufacturer in a turnkey system that includes testing of all        audio and video interfaces at any resolution, including native HD 1080P.        Promptlink’s unique, patent-pending “rolling rack” design allows for        pre- and post-staging of equipment. With this staging configuration,        testers can maximize production by rotating tested and untested        equipment quickly and simply in and out of a testing area. Combined with        universal cabling connections, the Promptlink solution provides the        speed, flexibility and technical excellence that have made Promptlink a        leader in CPE testing solutions.

The STBTP platform is now available in general release. Future releases        will support DAC (Q3 2014) and DNCS (Q4 2014) video delivery systems.
