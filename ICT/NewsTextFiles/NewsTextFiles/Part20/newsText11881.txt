
DETROIT (WWJ/AP) — Officials say a Detroit-based business is recalling about 1.8 million pounds of ground beef products sold for restaurant use in four states that may be contaminated with the bacteria E. coli.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service announced Monday that affected Wolverine Packing Co. products were produced between March 31 and April 18. They were shipped to distributors in Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, and Ohio.

Chuck Sanger is a spokesman for the company.

“The product was not labeled for retail sale, so this is product that is shipped through distributors through restaurants,” Sanger added.

The Food Safety and Inspection Service says 11 illnesses have been identified.

E. coli can cause severe cramps, nausea and diarrhea, as well as other complications.
