
Essentially, it is only with domestic and international brand building success inside Chinese companies that any tangible and permanent increase in consumption across China will be achieved.

The Chinese Dream can play a pivotal part here. Most a gree that President Xi's vision, as set out in his Chinese Dream, presents a combination of powerful national values such as "pride", "patriotism", "self-belief", "ambition", "innovation" and even "assertiveness", which should form a key guiding path for future Chinese society and individual lifestyles.

Many also agree that many of these values are precisely what most Chinese organizations still lack as they attempt to modernize and compete with higher quality products and brand both domestically and internationally.

In short, therefore, the Chinese Dream represents a set of values that most Chinese companies should now inculcate into their own corporate cultures.
