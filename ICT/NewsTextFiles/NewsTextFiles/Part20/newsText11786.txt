
MAIDUGURI, Nigeria â Hunters armed with homemade guns, poisoned spears and amulets have gathered by the hundreds, eager to use their skills and what they believe to be supernatural powers to help find nearly 300 schoolgirls abducted by Islamic extremists.

About 500 hunters, some as young as 18 and some in their 80s, say they have been specially selected by their peers for their spiritual hunting skills and have been waiting for two weeks in Maiduguri, the Borno state capital and the birthplace of Boko Haram, to get backing from the military and get moving.

With Nigeria's military accused by many citizens of not doing enough to rescue the girls, the hunters demonstrated their skills to an Associated Press reporter on Sunday. Cow horn trumpets echoed eerie war cries from the screaming and chanting men as they twirled knives and swords with dexterity, occasionally stabbing and cutting themselves with no apparent harm. The hunters claimed their magic charms prevented any blood being drawn. They trust amulets of herbs and other substances wrapped in leather pouches as well as cowrie shells, animal teeth and leather bracelets to protect them from bullets.

The kidnappings have spawned demonstrations and a tidal wave of commentary in media including social sites such as Twitter and Facebook.

A spokesman for the hunters stopped short of criticizing the military.

âWe're not saying we are better than the soldiers, but we know the bush better than the soldiers,â said Sarkin Baka. The hunters said they gathered here at the suggestion of a state legislator.

A military spokesman did not respond on whether it would take advantage of the hunters' local knowledge.

In contrast to the age-old stalking and tracking skills offered by the hunters, U.S. aircraft and camera-carrying drones are searching for the girls. Military teams from America, Britain, France, Spain and Israel with expertise in surveillance, intelligence gathering, counterterrorism and hostage negotiation are present.

Police say more than 300 girls and young women were kidnapped from a boarding school in the remote northeastern town of Chibok on April 15. Fifty-three escaped, and an estimated 276 remain in captivity, according to the police.
