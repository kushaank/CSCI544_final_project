
Three members of a unit of the Bloods street gang have been charged with robbing the Columbia Corner Market in Fluvanna County on Oct. 9.

Daniel Lamont Mathis, Shantai Monique Shelton, and an unnamed juvenile -- all confirmed members of the “99 Goons Syndikate,”-- are charged with the robbery, according to a federal indictment.

This indictment on federal racketeering charges also accuses Mathis and Shelton of being involved in the robbery, kidnapping, and murder of Kevin Quick, a Waynesboro Reserve Police Captain.  Quick’s bank account was accessed at an ATM in Fork Union after he was abducted; his remains were found on February 6 in Goochland County, not far from the Fluvanna County line.

The Columbia store was robbed around 7 p.m. at gunpoint by two robbers who escaped with an undisclosed amount of money. No one was injured.

Lt. David Wells with the Fluvanna County Sheriff’s Office is glad to see the alleged criminals off the streets.  “Any time severely violent offenders, especially in the case of this crew, are arrested and taken off the streets - when multiple law enforcement agencies come together and work appropriately - it is a great thing for the community,” said Wells.

Two armed gunmen robbed Kidd’s Store near Scottsville in Fluvanna County on Sept. 25, just a short time before the Columbia store robbery. One man has been arrested in that case, but the investigation continues.
