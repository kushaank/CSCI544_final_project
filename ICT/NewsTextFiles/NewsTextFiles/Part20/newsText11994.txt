Johnson Controls, a global multi-industrial company with multiple facilities in the Holland area, and Yanfeng Automotive Trim Systems, a wholly owned subsidiary of Huayu Automotive Systems, recently announced the signing of a definitive agreement to form a global automotive interiors joint venture.

The agreement between the two parties will create the largest automotive interiors company in the world, with revenues of about $7.5 billion. Yanfeng will hold the majority 70 percent share in the joint venture, and Johnson Controls will have a 30 percent share.

The new company will be headquartered in Shanghai with global engineering, development and customer centers in the United States, Europe, China, Japan and India. The product portfolio will include instrument panels and cockpit systems, door panels and floor consoles.

The transaction is subject to limited conditions and is expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2015. The agreement excludes certain facilities in Yanfeng and Johnson Controls' existing networks. Johnson Controls will continue to operate those within its network as part of Johnson Controls' Automotive Experience business.
