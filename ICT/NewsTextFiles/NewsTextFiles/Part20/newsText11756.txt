
ESCONDIDO  Plans to convert a former Albertson’s grocery store building on W. Mission Avenue into a county health center is meeting opposition from Escondido Mayor Sam Abed, who has a different vision for that part of the city.

The board of supervisors will discuss Tuesday whether to pursue a lease for the 11-acre, 113,000-square-foot property at 649 W. Mission Avenue between Rock Springs Road and North Quince Street. The county’s Department of Health and Human Services would use the property for a North Inland Regional Service Center.

But Abed wrote a letter to the supervisors earlier this month strongly objecting to the plan. He said the health center would be incompatible with Escondido’s long-term vision of a high-tech business park in the same area.

In an interview Monday, Abed declined to name the technology firm, but said the company has narrowed its search to Escondido or someplace in Texas. Even if that deal doesn’t materialize, he said, the city’s vision of a business park that would draw high-paying jobs is still in place.

Escondido has already begun the process of relocating its public works yard in preparation for the business park, he said.

Abed said he hopes the county will back off pursuing the Albertson’s lease and work with Escondido to find a more suitable location elsewhere in the city. He said he has spoken with Supervisor Dave Roberts about the situation.

Under the county’s plan, several older and undersized offices that provide a variety of health and social services would be consolidated into the former grocery store site. Remodeling and construction work would begin by the end of the summer, with a projected move in date set for April 1, 2015.

The owner of the Albertson’s property — Diamond Development LLC — has already received conditional approval from Escondido for the proposed office and retail plans and no additional planning actions are required, county officials said.

A public hearing about the proposal has been scheduled before the city’s Planning Commission for May 27.

Abed declined to comment on what might happen if the supervisors approve the lease. He said the city doesn’t want to get into a fight with the county until such time that it becomes unavoidable.

The regional service center would include space for the Escondido Family Resource Center, Child Welfare Services, a public health center, Aging & Independence Services, a Health and Human Services regional administration center, Veteran’s Service Center and other programs.

The proposed lease would be for 10 years with three five-year options after that.
