
The US is the world's biggest market for organic products and the industry had another great year here in 2013.

Sales rose 11.5% to $35.1 billion - the fastest growth since the recession began in 2008, according to the Organic Trade Association (OTA). They expect about the same growth levels for the next two years.

If we look at fruits and vegetables, organic has a 10% share of the total with $11.6 billion in sales, up 15%.

beverages, up 5% to $4 billion.

US farmland isn't being converted to organic at a fast enough pace to meet demand. Supplies of organic feed and grain are tight and costly, a problem for organic dairy and meat producers.  3000 farms are in transition right now.

"Consumer education is critical to grow the organic industry," says Laura Batcha, executive director of OTA.

The bad news is the NOSB is making it more difficult to phase out synthetic and non-organic materials from organic food. Until now, if a non-organic material was approved - such as carrageenan - it would automatically "sunset" after five years unless a two-thirds majority voted to keep it on the list.
