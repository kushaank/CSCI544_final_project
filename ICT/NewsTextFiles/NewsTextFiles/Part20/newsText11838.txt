
SHAH ALAM: Some 951 residents of a low-cost flat at Taman Chi Liung in Klang failed in their bid to retrieve their strata titles despite a 23-year wait following a High Court decision today.

The developer of the flats, Chi Liung Holdings Sdn Bhd, had filed a suit on March 1, 2013, against Alliance Investment Bank Berhad, which is the manager and agent for a consortium of 12 lenders, to surrender the related master titles to the Shah Alam Land Office in order to process the strata titles for units.

The lenders (various banks) were however not willing to release the master titles due to the developer's default of the loan repayments amounting to RM38 million although in default, Chi Liung Holdings completed the flats in 1990 and the owners had occupied their units in early 1991.

In 2011, the developer had paid RM837,425 in two cheques as the full and final settlement of the loan and Alliance.

Shah Alam High Court Judge Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail held that Alliance had proved in corresponding letters and through its conduct that the RM837,425 could not be accepted as the full and final settlement and only the consortium of lenders could decide on the matter.

She said there was no binding agreement between Chi Liung Holdings and Alliance although the latter had cashed both the cheques.

"There is no clear undertaking to release (the strata titles)," she said.

In its statement of defence, Alliance denied entering into an agreement that the RM837,425 constituted the full settlement of the outstanding loan.
