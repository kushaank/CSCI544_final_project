
May   19, 2014 – On Thursday, the School Board heard testimony  alleging that the Santa Monica DoubleTree Hotel, which sits on School   District property, owes back money in rent and is violating  labor laws.

Community members, Santa    Monica students, labor organizers and clergy urged  the District to examine the hotel’s lease more thoroughly, stating that the  hotel owed much more than originally thought.

Under the lease, the District should receive a base rent  plus a percentage of earnings after a certain profit level has been reached.  According to public records, the District has never collected additional rent  under the lease. A  study posted on the City’s website indicates that the hotel had above  market average daily room rates and occupancy in 2013.

“Additional rent is calculated by a formula, and at that  formula’s base is the hotel’s net cash flow,” said Melanie Luthern, a community  organizer for UNITE HERE Local 11.

Contributions have accrued at the Hotel since 1990, and the  District has not provided estimates of outstanding “cash contribution” more  current than 2010, according to Luthern.

Said school board president Maria Leon-Vasquez, “We’re still  in the investigatory phase, so there are still a lot of questions to ask  concerning this issue,”.

The Doubletree did not return several requests for comment.

This generated around $42.3 million in hotel tax revenue for  the City of Santa Monica,  according to the report.

“In light of the PKF Study and the CVB’s  report, we would expect that Hotel revenue will soon become an important source  of District revenue,” said Luthern.
