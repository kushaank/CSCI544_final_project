
Though Apple remains in the thick of a protracted court battle, or series of court battles, with bitter rival/”strange bedfellow” Samsung, the Cupertino, Calif. company has buried the hatchet with another longtime rival, Google.  The two companies announced Friday that they will drop all lawsuits against each other in relation to smartphone technology.  Covered in the accord is Google’s Motorola Mobility subsidiary, a company that is in the process of being bought out by Motorola, and one that Apple has legally been at war with since 2010.

Aside from dropping legal action against each other, Apple and Google’s joint statement also confirmed that both tech giants would work hand-in-hand on patent reform.  This is interesting, as this is one of the most contentious issues in the world of tech law, and it remains to be seen how strong – or how tenuous – Google and Apple’s relationship would be as they come off this new accord.  Motorola had first sued Apple over smartphone technology patent infringement in 2010, and Apple quickly fired back with a countersuit, which in turn gave birth to several ancillary cases across multiple continents.  Google, naturally, had inherited the patent tiff when it purchased Motorola Mobility in 2012.  Even as Lenovo is buying Motorola out, the company will still keep “a vast majority” of 17,000-some patents in its name.

Another interesting detail in the Apple/Google joint statement is how there would be no cross-licensing deals between both firms.  This is worth mentioning as Apple (iOS) and Google (Android) are in competition with each other in the operating system space.  But at the end of the day, the fact that both companies have suddenly decided to “shake on it” with no forewarning sets a good example in a tech space where “patent trolls” and legitimate companies and individuals alike are contributing to the growing number of lawsuits in the industry.
