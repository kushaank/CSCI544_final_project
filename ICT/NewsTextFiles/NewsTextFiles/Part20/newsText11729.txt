
Insurers and reinsurers have coped well so far with recent extreme weather events, according to a report released Monday by Standard & Poor's Corp.

The report said reinsurers generally have been able to manage the impact of the extreme weather events over the past two years because of their risk diversification, as well as their effective underwriting, risk management, and risk mitigation practices.
