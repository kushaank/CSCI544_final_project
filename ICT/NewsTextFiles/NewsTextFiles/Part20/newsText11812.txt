Wausau Paper (NYSE:WPP) announced the launch of its new Artisan(TM) line of premium towels carefully crafted from the Company's innovative ATMOS technology-enabled paper machine at Harrodsburg, Kentucky. Artisan products are brilliant white, remarkably strong, yet designed to provide a soft and thorough hand drying experience. The toweling has a clean and hygienic appearance as well as cloth-like durability and strength for exceptional performance. Artisan provides the pinnacle in premium while also supporting sustainability initiatives. Artisan is the only line of premium quality roll and folded towels that feature Green Seal(TM) certification. Towels are made from superior quality 100 percent recycled fibers providing premium appearance and comfort. Artisan towels, with their unique surface pattern, cater to high-end facilities seeking exceptional quality products that reinforce an upscale image.

"The launch of our new Artisan premium towel line marks the culmination of several years of development and hard work throughout the Company to bring to market premium green," commented Matthew L. Urmanski, president and chief operating officer. "Artisan is truly a one-of-a-kind product line marrying together the premium attributes traditionally found only in virgin-style products with the environmentally responsibility of Green Seal certification. As we continue to further our goal of becoming a complete green manufacturer across our entire paper brand portfolio, Artisan brings us ever closer to this vision."
