
Members of the Kanawha County Commission gave their nod Monday to a $50,000 engineering study of a plan to treat mine runoff from two Patriot Coal facilities near Eskdale.

Patriot is under a 2010 federal court order requiring the mining company to clean up dozens of illegal discharges of selenium at three major mining complexes in Southern West Virginia, including the Eskdale facilities that employ about 750 people. The mines have been discharging runoff into Slaughters Creek for decades.

Officials for Patriot want to pipe mine runoff that currently ends up in the creek to the Kanawha Public Service District for treatment. But before any final deal is reached between the coal company, the public service district and the state Public Service Commission, county officials want to make sure the plan is both safe and feasible.

Patriot has agreed to foot the bill for an engineering study of the proposed plan. County commissioners agreed to the study at a special meeting Monday.

Also Monday, commissioners got a progress report on the Upper Kanawha Valley Enterprise Community building near Chelyan. The county commission had to bail out the business incubator recently after the facility lost its largest tenant.

Executive Director Damron Bradshaw told Carper and county commissioners Dave Hardy and Hoppy Shores the facility is advertising on the Internet and working with the Charleston Area Alliance to find new tenants. He said a distribution company is interested in moving into the facility.

County commissioners will check back with the enterprise community in another month.
