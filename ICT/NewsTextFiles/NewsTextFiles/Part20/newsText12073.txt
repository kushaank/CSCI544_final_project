
APA reported that Civil society organisations in Zambia expressed outrage at disparaging comments by the Indian owner of the country’s largest copper mining company against the government for selling the mine cheaply in desperation.

Indian tycoon Mr Anwar Agarwal owns Vedanta Resources that acquired Konkola Copper Mines from the Zambian government about 10 years ago for USD 25 million instead of its real market value of USD 400 million.

Mr Agarwal is alleged to have made disparaging comments against the late Mr Levy Mwanawasa former president of Zambia who presided over the sale of the company, at a time when the company was on the verge of collapsing after a previous investor in the company abruptly pulled out of the country.

Mr Agarwal boasted how Vedanta Resources now makes a profit of USD 500 million annually while consistently declaring losses or minimal profits to the Zambian government, thereby contributing little to the national treasury in terms of taxes.

Mr Joseph Mutenkenya spokesperson for the civil society groups said that it was extremely unfortunate an investor who had been entrusted with the country’s biggest copper mine could mock the Zambian government and its people.

He demanded that the former minister of finance in the Mwanawasa government Ngande Magande should explain what transpired for the country to have handed a profitable mine to an investor at a fraction of its market value.
