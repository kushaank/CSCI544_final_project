
I've seen the future, and it is a box of rotten brownie mix.

Last week I joined a group of community leaders and elected officials on a tour of Summit Natural Energy. The company is turning discarded apple cores, that bygone brownie mix and a whole host of agricultural wastes into clean fuel that is powerful enough to gas up the fastest race cars.

Founded by entrepreneurs looking to reduce waste from their own well-loved fruit company, Summit takes what is essentially trash from local farmers and food producers -- contaminated flour, fruit trimmings -- and figures out the best way to convert each waste into ethanol. They then distribute that clean, home-grown fuel across Oregon in partnership with SeQuential Pacific Biodiesel. The team at Summit also uses recycled water and composts any waste left over from producing ethanol.

Summit's work is good for the environment, good for farmers and good for business. But growth of their innovative business is hampered.

As I toured their plant in Cornelius, Oregon, along with Washington County Commissioner Greg Malinowski and candidates for other state and county positions, I learned that Summit has the capacity to increase production and be an even bigger part of the Cornelius economy. But to do that they need two things: inputs and demand.

The inputs are easy: If you are a farmer, send your waste their way! In order to increase demand for their clean, efficient fuels, however, the Oregon Legislature must act.
