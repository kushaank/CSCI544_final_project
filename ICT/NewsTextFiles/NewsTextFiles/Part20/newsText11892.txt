
TRANSPORT for London insisted yesterday that the London Underground will continue to run over the bank holiday weekend, despite union claims that a looming strike by staff manning the power controls would halt the Tube.

The Unite union met with TfL officials yesterday to try to avoid a three-day walkout in protest at pay and conditions for 40 power technicians.

The TSSA and RMT unions are also supporting the industrial action.

“There is a real possibility that the Underground could close down over the bank holiday weekend,” said Unite regional officer Hugh Roberts, claiming that “health and safety concerns” could force lines to power down from Friday evening.

The planned strike would run from 4am on Saturday until 8am on Tuesday 27 May.

However, a spokesperson for TfL said yesterday that there are enough qualified staff to run the network as normal even if the dispute continues. The staff involved in the walkout work at the TfL control room in Southwark, where power is coordinated for the Tube’s 270 stations.

The unions remain in talks with TfL over a broader dispute surrounding TfL’s plans to close all ticket offices, which prompted two-day walkouts in February and April.
