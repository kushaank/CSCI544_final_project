
Addis Ababans are angry at the Ethiopian government which used the city’s Oromo version name “Finfine” to label a massive new cargo ship. It is considered as a tactic to spark ethnic clashes in order to divide and rule the country.

Residents of Addis Ababa city are angry after the Ethiopian government used the Oromo name “Finfine” to label a massive new ship purchased to transport the country’s exports. The government media broadcasted the purchase of nine new cargo ships and it used the regional capital city names to label the vessels.

According to ESLSE, there are no ships named after “Addis Ababa” in Amharic. The African Union (AU) capital Addis Ababa is only 19% ethnic Oromo and 47% ethnic Amhara but nearly the whole population speaks Amharic language. Originally settled first by ethnic Gurage people in the 9th century, Addis Ababa (Finfine) today is only 16% Gurage.

Ethiopian Shipping & Logistics Services Enterprise (ESLSE) purchased the nine vessels from Huanghai Shipbuilding Company worth $300 million US dollars.

EPRDF ruling party uses similar tactics to spark ethnic disputes, in order to divide and rule the country. The vessel Finfine (ETFN) has a Gross tonnage capacity of 21,024-gt and it was built in 2013.
