
There may soon be a swanky shopping mall at the M.G. Road Metro station, including the site where Plaza theatre once stood.

Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) has called for an Expression of Interest (EoI) to set up branded retail outlets at the station.

According to a senior Metro official, around 15,000 sq ft space is available on the Manekshaw Parade Grounds side, while around 10,000 sq ft is available on the opposite side.

“It is a prime location and offers ample opportunities for retail outlets. While the area on the parade grounds side is ready, the section where the theatre once stood is still under construction. The purpose of the EOI is to ascertain the requirements, based on which the building construction can be adjusted and redesigned,” he said.

The official said the space could be used to develop and operate branded retail outlets. The official said the outlets could be set up on all three levels: ground, concourse and platform. The space on the parade grounds side could be utilised for a restaurant with an entry/exit directly from the outside, while the other side will also open out onto Church Street. “We will float tenders once the EOI is finalised,” the official said, admitting that there was a delay in completing the construction of the building.

Once the station is extended to across the road, the existing skywalk will become operational. This will allow people to reach the station from across the road (opposite the boulevard) and from Church Street.

The M.G. Road–Byapanahalli stretch became operational on October 20, 2011. The building on the side opposite the station was to have been completed within a year’s time. The official attributed the delay to “challenges in construction”.
