
ALBANY — A teenager faces multiple charges and an elderly man remained hospitalized on Monday after Albany Police Department officials said the teen got behind the wheel after he had been drinking and struck the man as he was walking nearby in the Lake Loretta area early Friday.

The accident, said Phyllis Banks, spokeswoman for the Albany Police Department, occurred at 6:48 a.m. on Friday on the 1000 block of Edgewater Drive. Tucker Greenfield, 18, of Albany, was driving a 2003 Mazda Tribute. He was traveling north on Edgewater Drive when his vehicle left the roadway and went onto the dirt path around the lake and struck Sammie Osley, 78, also of Albany.

Osley was taken to the hospital with what police officials described as a serious head injury. A spokesman with Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital said he was in good condition on Monday.

Banks said Greenfield told police that he had been drinking at a friend’s house prior to the accident. He was cited for serious injury by vehicle, driving under the influence, underage consumption of alcohol and failure to maintain lane.
