
WALTHAM, Mass.--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Commonwealth Financial Network® today announces the addition        of Esposito, Kiker and Associates (EK&A) of Glen Ellyn, Illinois, to its        network of independent financial advisors. Formerly affiliated with        MassMutual Financial Group, Joe Esposito and Keith Kiker bring with them        more than $150 million in client assets.

EK&A offers comprehensive financial planning and investment management        services for high-net-worth clients—executives, business owners,        professionals, and retirees. As objective, independent financial        planning strategists, EK&A develops comprehensive, customized plans for        their clients’ specific needs and goals, and manages their wealth with a        systematic, long-term approach. For more information, please visit www.EKandA.com .

Prior to joining Commonwealth, Esposito and Kiker used The Advisor        Center’s virtual recruiting platform to perform their due diligence and        explore affiliation options. The Advisor Center provided a centralized,        objective platform where Esposito and Kiker were able to view a range of        broker/dealer–RIA affiliation options. Ultimately, they found        Commonwealth’s culture and infrastructure to be the right solution for        their practice.

Founded in 1979, Commonwealth Financial Network, member FINRA/SIPC, is        the nation’s largest privately held independent broker/dealer–RIA, with        headquarters in Waltham, Massachusetts, and San Diego, California. J.D.        Power and Associates ranks Commonwealth “Highest in Independent Advisor        Satisfaction Among Financial Investment Firms, Three Times in a Row.”        The firm supports more than 1,487 independent advisors nationwide in        serving their clients as registered representatives, investment adviser        representatives, and registered investment advisers, as well as through        hybrid service models.

The Advisor Center is a web-based community empowering financial        advisors to explore and compare new professional opportunities        anonymously. The firm’s unique platform connects a diverse group of        financial firms across all industry channels with financial advisors        considering changing broker/dealers, joining an RIA, establishing an        RIA, or joining an existing branch. The Advisor Center’s founder and        CEO, Tom Daley, discovered over his 25 years in the financial services        industry that advisors did not have a way to confidently and easily        explore new career opportunities.

The Advisor Center is the only solution in the industry that gives        financial advisors the control to research their options efficiently,        conveniently, and anonymously. The absence of advertising provides        advisors with a one-stop shop for objectively comparing a wide range of        opportunities from large broker/dealers to branches and RIAs. A        proprietary messaging system allows advisors to engage with companies,        remaining anonymous until a sufficient comfort level is achieved to        share confidential information. In turn, each company garners        unprecedented visibility via their own microsite storefront in a        community of potential recruits often missed using traditional        recruiting methods.
