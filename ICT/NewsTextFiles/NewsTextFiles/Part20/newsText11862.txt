
Peter Molyneux's new god-game spread its dominion to iOS after soft-launching in the New Zealand App Store over the weekend. Godus is available as a free download, and although no official announcement's been made its arrival downunder is likely the prelude to a full release in the coming weeks.

The iOS version offers gems as in-app purchases, with 100 gems costing NZ$6.49 (around $5.60). Purchasable gems have been a subject of contention for Molyneux and devloper 22 Cans, harking back to Godus' launch on Steam Early Access last year. However, the industry veteran denies his mobile model is like other free-to-play games.

"What we need is a new term," Molyneux said earlier this year. "And that term is more like 'invest-to-play'. What really are we doing? We are tempting people to invest some of their money into a game."

GODUS empowers you in the role of a god, allowing you to sculpt every inch of a beautiful world that you look down upon, on which a population of Followers settle and multiply. As you mould every aspect of your unique utopia, a civilisation will blossom across your land and offer you their belief.
