
An extended centennial celebration for Transfiguration Roman Catholic Church in West Deer culminated on Sunday with a service that focused on the parish's past, present and future.

The Most Rev. William Winter, a retired bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, led the 100th anniversary Mass, which brought together about 200 parishioners and a few pastors who, at one time or another, were involved with the church.

It was a day that, in the eyes of several parishioners and clergymen, did not seem possible only eight years ago when fire destroyed the parish's Poma Street church. But like Transfiguration's congregation has done on several occasions before and since the fire, the group banded together and found a solution, ultimately opening another church two years later along McKrell Road.

Transfiguration's past elicits from its parishioners a pride that's rooted in overcoming adversity.

Its origins date to the early 20th century, when the people of West Deer successfully petitioned St. Mary of Czestochowa in New Kensington for a pastor to lead their own parish. The area was considered a mission of St. Mary's.

By August 1914, the group founded a church committee and began building their Poma Street church, which they completed two years later. On the 50th anniversary of the church committee's founding, Transfiguration began building a school along McKrell Road.

As things went along smoothly for close to another 50 years, the parish had a major setback in June 2006 when a car parked behind the church caught fire during a morning Mass. The flames spread to the church, eventually causing the roof to collapse.

No one was injured, but the damage to the parish seemed irreparable, according to lifelong parishioner Dorothy Neibar, 78, of West Deer.

For the next two years, Transfiguration held Mass in the McKrell Road school's gymnasium as the congregation fought with the diocese to rebuild. Bishop David Zubik, according to Transfiguration's self-written history, rejected the idea based on demographic studies of the area.

The parish endured another blow in 2008 when, because of declining enrollment, the diocese closed the school. That's when the parish began renovating the gymnasium as its place of worship and held its first Mass following construction in November of that year.

In presenting Transfiguration with a congratulatory proclamation from the Legislature, Sen. Randy Vulakovich, R-Shaler, pointed to the parish's resilience as a model for community strength and leadership.

The Mass marked the final event for the church's centennial celebration, which featured several special ceremonies during the past eight months. Included in the centennial were events honoring public servants, veterans, the Knights of Columbus and the sacrament of marriage.

The Rev. James Holland, Transfiguration's pastor, is planning to implement two programs at the church.

A clinical nurse specialist, Holland has been working with the University of Pittsburgh to establish a healthy lifestyles program, which he hopes to start by September. Also in the works is a tutoring program that would take advantage of the extra classroom space at the church to help struggling students in the Deer Lakes School District.
