
On May 16, 2014, we issued an updated research report on U.S. health insurer Cigna Corp. (NYSE: CI ). The company's first-quarter 2014 net operating earnings came in at $1.83 per share, handily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.53.

Earnings were also up 6.4% year over year. Cigna's better-than-expected earnings came from strong contribution from all its business segments.

Cigna is a niche player in the health insurance market with a well diversified business profile with reach in different markets.

Also, Cigna continues to strengthen its physician partnerships through more than 66 Collaborative Accountable Care initiatives.

On the flip side, Cigna is expected to witness a rise in medical costs as members increase utilization of health care services. While low utilization over the past three years have driven the bottom line, an increase in utilization this year will erode margins to some extent.

Also, Cigna's exposure to commercial mortgage loans and real estate loans continue to bother us as these problem loans may create earnings volatility.

Following the company's strong first-quarter earnings release, Cigna has been witnessing rising earnings estimates. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2014 moved up by 2.0% to $7.30 as 10 out of 13 estimates moved north. The same for 2015 rose 1.1% to $8.05 as 8 of 13 estimates were raised over the same time frame.

While Cigna currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), other better ranked players Horace Mann Educators Corp. (NYSE: HMN ) and Old Republic International Corp. (NYSE: ORI ) with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) as well as Prudential plc. (NYSE: PUK ) with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) are worth considering.
