
In 1511, Portuguese conquerors where arriving at Malaysia. Then, sultan Mahmud Sha hide a treasure somewhere at Malacca.

Gold and silver; sophisticated jewels and precious stones; pieces of furniture and artwork… A legendary treasure that they are trying to find now.

Pulau Nankga is a small fishing island just 20 hectares, surrounded by coral and located 17 kilometers from the Malaysian east coast.

What do you think? Maybe the treasure was found during the last five centuries. Maybe that lucky person never told anyone. Remember ‘The Count of Monte Cristo “by Dumas.

Anyway, it’s a thrilling story (or reality). I love it!
