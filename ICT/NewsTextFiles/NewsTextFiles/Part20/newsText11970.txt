The telecoms company, whose network is also relied on by dozens of other broadband providers including Sky and TalkTalk, has been rapped by watchdogs for leaving customers stranded without web access for too long. Watchdog Ofcom will on Tuesday publish its final decision on tough new sanctions designed to ensure BT repairs faults within two working days and installs new lines within 12 working days. "One customer being out of service for too long is one too many," said Joe Garner, chief executive of Openreach, which builds and maintains BT's network. "Millions of customers depend on broadband and they rely on us to keep them connected, whatever the weather." Garner said the new recruits would be a "welcome boost" to an engineering workforce that completes hundreds of thousands of jobs - such as installing fibre optic lines - each week.
