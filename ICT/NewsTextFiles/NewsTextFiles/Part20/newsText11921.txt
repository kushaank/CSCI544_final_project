
“You cannot put guns in the hands of a criminal” were the words from the judge as he sentenced the only person charged in connection with the West Webster tragedy on Christmas Eve morning in 2012.

Ted Scardino, who survived the ambush on Christmas Eve morning, was in court for the sentencing.

Since her conviction, one of Nguyen's sisters started an online petition asking for leniency. Her sister wrote that Dawn is a “first time offender, beautiful, educated and an asset to this society.” More than 500 people signed the petition.

Nguyen will be in federal court on Wednesday for a hearing. She’s already been arraigned on a federal charge. The crime is buying a gun for a convicted felon, which is called a straw purchase. She will face much tougher penalties for the federal charge.
