
There are over 11 million active Facebook accounts in Australia and the average Australian spends one in every five minutes on Facebook each day. That’s 4.8 hours every day!

So if people are spending that much time on social media, what are they doing? If you’re like me and most Australians, you’re on Facebook to keep in touch with family and friends, brands you’re interested in, or for some, to post the occasional selfie.

These recent algorithm changes by Facebook means that Facebook now decides what content to automatically display on all of our personal newsfeeds when we log in. If a company is not posting relevant and engaging content that is inherently useful to its fans, the engagement on that company page will decline rapidly on everything they post... unless you pay to play.

You can choose to get upset that it’s no longer free to reach your fans. Or you can understand that Facebook was never about advertising anyway. It’s always been about socialising with family, friends, communities and brands we cherish.

On all of your social networks you need to stop posting content that brings people to your pages and start posting content that people will want to come back for and share with their family and friends. That’s a completely different mindset and can have a huge impact on the perception of your brand that works 24/7.

Remember this: it doesn’t matter how many ‘likes’ you have. It’s how many that care for and consider your company just another one of their friends.

One mortgage broker has gained just under 16,000 likes on his Facebook page and is now showing other brokers how they can do the same.

Social media is about people. If you believe the cliché, real estate and mortgage broking are also about people, not property.
