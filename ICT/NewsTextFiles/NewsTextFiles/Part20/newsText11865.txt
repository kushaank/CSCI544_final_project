
FORSYTH COUNTY -- During a short meeting when most items were postponed Thursday, Forsyth County commissioners voted unanimously to suspend alcohol sales at two businesses.

Both locations – Cumming Texaco at 720 Atlanta Hwy. and Quik Mart Citgo at 2860 Old Atlanta Road – had employees who sold alcohol to minors.

Administrative hearings were held for both violations during a commission meeting on May 1, but commissioners voted to delay judgment until Thursday’s meeting.

The violations were not first offenses for either business.

Commissioner Peter Amos, in whose district Cumming Texaco is located, said since the May 1 hearing, he and county staff had met with the business’ owner and the license holder, John Dow.

Amos moved that Dow’s alcohol license be suspended for a total of six days, broken up into two three-day time periods.

Josh Scoggins, an attorney representing Chanmeet Saluja, owner and alcohol license holder for the Quik Mart Citgo, said in the time since the hearing, Saluja had hired Operation 21 to come in and train all employees on proper alcohol sales.
