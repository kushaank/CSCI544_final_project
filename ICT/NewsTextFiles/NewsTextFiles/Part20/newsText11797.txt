
Much like the craft beer boom of the late '80s, Pennsylvania distillers are experiencing a renaissance in craft spirits. Not since Prohibition has the state experienced more distilling activity: a homegrown economic enterprise that goes from field to bottle, all in the state of Pennsylvania.

From Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, there is a teeming cottage industry of entrepreneurs creating and producing high-quality spirits recognized and sold nationally. All of this burgeoning economic activity could be undermined by Pennsylvania's âwine-onlyâ attempt at privatization, which would take a halfway approach by privatizing wine while leaving distilled spirits as the sole product sold in state stores.

This approach to privatization will create an unfair burden on taxpayers and distilleries because the wine-only plan isn't really privatization. It imposes a tortured market structure on the Pennsylvania beverage alcohol industry that would lead to a net reduction in tax collections and state store profits.

Under the proposal, Pennsylvania would have to maintain the state store system at a cost of nearly $400 million per year for taxpayers. At the same time there would be a massive increase in the number of private wine retailers and beer will be made easily available in grocery stores â creating a considerable competitive disadvantage for spirits producers and inconvenience for Pennsylvanians.

The state would see reduced tax collections and state store profits, as state store sales are substituted for private sector sales that would be far less profitable to Pennsylvania. In fact, Pennsylvania would lose $1.26 for each bottle of wine sold through a private outlet. Under the latest proposal, the state is projected to lose $19 million in taxes and profits annually.

It is also difficult to imagine any cost savings from the wine-only plan. Since the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board (PLCB) would still act as the wholesaler/retailer to the new private wine outlets, the volume going through the PLCB system would be the same or greater â forcing the PLCB to maintain employment levels.

The proposed system would increase the number of outlets selling wine and the overall complexity of alcohol sales. The PLCB would still have to administer the new system, leading to even greater PLCB staffing and costs.

If the people of Pennsylvania decide to privatize, the new legal framework governing the sale and distribution of beverage alcohol should result in an efficient marketplace that is consumer friendly.  Statistics show 70 percent of spirits drinkers also drink wine and beer; and Pennsylvanians, like people in other states, prefer convenience.

The wine-only proposal provides none of this and would come at a time when Pennsylvania consumers are already poorly served. The typical state has more than three retail spirits outlets per 10,000 adults. Pennsylvania has less than one per 10,000.

Half-measures produce disappointing results. Brewers, vintners and distillers should be allowed to compete on a level playing field. Discriminatory policies would certainly punish the commonwealth's growing distilling industry.

If Pennsylvania lawmakers want to privatize its alcohol system, they should get privatization right. A wine-only proposal creates a system that favors some types of alcohol over others and that is bad for consumers, bad for business and ultimately bad for the commonwealth.
