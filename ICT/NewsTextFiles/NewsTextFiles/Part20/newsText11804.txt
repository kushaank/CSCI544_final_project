The long-expected sale of troubled Robert Bosch subsidiary Aleo Solar has been confirmed, transferring ownership of the company’s ‘Aleo’ brand and factory in Prenzlau, Germany, to Hamburg-based consortium SCP Solar.

Under the terms of the deal, Bosch will pay €31 million (US$42.5 million) to the new owners in compensation, while Aleo itself will pay SCP Solar around €7 million (US$9.6 million) in the first instalment of the negative purchase price. Inventory shortfall compensation of around €5.4 million (US$7.4 million) will also be paid. SCP Solar includes Taiwan-based solar cell producer, Sunrise Global Solar Energy and Japanese manufacturing machinery producer, CHOSHU Industry.

Around 180 employees will move with the new company. One of the appointed liquidators, York zu Putlitz, said the sale meant as many as possible of the Aleo employees could be offered deals at the new company.

At an extraordinary general meeting on 15 April, Aleo Solar’s board had resolved to liquidate the company, also announcing its intention to relocate its offices and change its operating name to AS Abwicklung und Solar-Service. Prior to that, Bosch had announced that it would only support Aleo financially until March this year. Full year reports showed that revenues had fallen at Aleo by over 50% in 2013 compared to 2012.
