
It’s developing countries that take the brunt of tax avoidance by US and UK companies.

Great Britainâ€™s top 100 companies own 30,000 subsidiary corporationsâ€”300 for every company. And according to a new report by Christian Aid, 10,000 of these subsidiaries are located in tax havens , that is, jurisdictions that let corporations get away with almost no reporting. Thereâ€™s no way to make sure that these huge companies are paying their fair share of taxes.

Companies use subsidiaries like secret bank accounts. They form corporations in jurisdictions with weak tax laws, stash their money in these tax havens, and keep it secret from the public. This secrecy allows companies to lower their tax bill without anyone knowing about it, including tax-paying citizens who play by the rules.

US companies use the same trickery to hide their money and lower their tax bills. Apple , Google , Starbucks , and Microsoft are just a few of the US companies charged with using secret off-shore accounts to avoid paying taxes.

Earlier this year, Citizens for Tax Justice released a report examining the tax bills of Fortune 500 companies over the past five years. Despite earning profits every single year, 26 corporations didnâ€™t pay a single penny in federal income taxes for all five years. These corporationsâ€”including Boeing, GE, Verizon, and Pricelineâ€”earned $170 billion but paid nothing in taxes. More than 100â€”including Goldman Sachs, Facebook, Exxon Mobil, and Wells Fargoâ€”didnâ€™t pay any taxes for at least one year, despite consistent profits.

According to the Christian Aid report, 98 of the top 100 companies on the London Stock Exchange have a subsidiary in a tax haven. Big banks are particularly egregious. The five banks that Christian Aid analyzed have more than 5,000 subsidiaries, with 1,500 subsidiaries that report absolutely no information at all. This means five banks control an average of 300 secret accounts each, black boxes totally closed to scrutiny.

Mining and oil and gas companies arenâ€™t much better. Nearly two-thirds of their 3,500 subsidiaries are in tax havens, and two-thirds of those do not report any informationâ€”pitch-black mine shafts hiding secret gold.

Christian Aid calls for country-by-country reportingâ€”requiring corporations to report profits where they were actually earned, rather than where they were stashedâ€”as a way to combat the use of tax havens. Developing countriesâ€”often hardest-hit by corporate tax avoidanceâ€”must be included in the conversation, as Oxfam called for it in its recent report on corporate tax reform, Business Among Friends .

When companies donâ€™t pay their fair share of taxes, everyone else feels the pain. Too many secrets hurt.

I favour nothing but a progressive income tax, with the reporting provisions you advocate for corporations.  Corporations are simply a mechanism, should not be treated like a ‘person’ under the law – yes, I know they are.  In a sense the corporation is being used as a tax shelter for the individual and given these tax loopholes so that individuals can avoid taxation.

Don’t tax corporations, tax their shareholders and owners (their employees are already well-taxed, for the most part) and along with that take away tax protection for all NGOs except pure humanitarian aid: medical and disaster relief.  This would include religions.

Tax each individual and take down all the structures set up by lawyers.
