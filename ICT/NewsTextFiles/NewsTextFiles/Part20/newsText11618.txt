There are several corporate companies in the city corporation limits, which utilise the roads and infrastructure. Those companies should reserve a considerable percentage of their corporate social responsibility funds for the greenery project of the city corporation," Marla said and appealed the involvement of  Kanara Chamber of Commerce and Industry too in the project.

"All facilities in the city corporation office including trade licence applications and self assessment system (SAS) of taxation will be made pro-people and hassle-free. A special drive will be launched to make all property owners to pay SAS on time. Emphasis will be given for the prevention of spread of malaria in the city.
