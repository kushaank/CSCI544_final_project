
The Ministry of Labour, Industrial Relations and Employment has commended close to 600 employers around Fiji for implementing the national minimum wage of $2 per hour.

Labour Minister â€“ Jone Usamate says Labour inspectors visited the employers between March and April and did not find any case of employers paying below the minimum wage rate.

Usamate says this is a significant achievement for the current Fijian Government as it is a first time ever for Fiji to enact such a legislation.

However, during the inspections, the Ministry found that a number of employers are not issuing pay slips which is a concern to them.

As such, Labour inspectors issued a total of 24 on-the-spot fines of $100 each to 24 employers which amounted to a total of $2,400 in fines.

Usamate highlighted that a total of 50 cases on unfair dismissal in the NMW sector have been received by the ministry for 34 male and 16 female workers within the first two months of the NMW implementation.

The Minister urges all employers to comply with the provisions of the labour law and to ensure that all workers are treated fairly.
