
Georgia has paid off a $1 billion federal loan used to help pay state unemployment insurance benefits during the Great Recession.

Last week, state officials sent the final payment of nearly $62.5 million to the U.S. Department of Labor to pay off the loan two years early, a press release said.

In December of 2007, with the unemployment rate at 5.1 percent, Georgiaâ€™s unemployment insurance trust fund had a balance of $1.3 billion. But two years later, the unemployment rate had more than doubled to 10.4 percent and the trust fund was depleted. Georgia, along with 30 other states, borrowed from the federal government to continue the benefits. According to the release, the $956.4 million in interest has paid, as well as $56.7 million in interest. The state is scheduled to pay the final interest payment of $2.7 million by Sept. 30.

Officials noted that the state has paid $3.9 billion in state unemployment insurance benefits fromt he time of the loan through March 2014.

Legislative action in 2012 helped repay the loan, officials said, explaining that legislation increased the amount of base wages used to calculate employer UI taxes from $8,500 to $9,500 and reduced the maximum period a person can receive benefits from 26 weeks to 14 to 20 weeks on a sliding scale tied to the unemployment rate.

Accepting the loan meant that federal unemployment taxes rose, so Butler noted that the taxes will now go down.

The state unemployment insurance trust fund has a current balance of $355,827,774.92, the release added.

As of Friday, 14 other states have not yet repaid their federal unemployment loans.
