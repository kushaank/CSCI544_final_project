
With the exception of iron ore, Macquarie observes supply growth rates in bulk materials and metals markets are finally slowing, as the miners' productivity push abates. Demand outside of China is outperforming expectations as sentiment turns more positive. China is still expected to deliver the majority of global commodities demand this year, but the government's efforts to drive change in the business models of state-owned enterprises and maintain tight creditÂ means sentiment is being kept in check.

Macquarie thinks nickel's story is just starting. For the first time in over two years there is a pronounced constraint to the raw material because of the Indonesian ore ban. Ore prices have doubled this year and fed through to higher quotes on the London Metal Exchange. There are some concerns that Indonesian nickel pig iron capacity could ramp up more quickly than expected via the blast furnace route. Macquarie thinks this view is flawed as the saprolitic ore faces severe technical challenges when used in a blast furnace. Even with aggressive re-balancing assumptions, Macquarie believe a multi-year deficit in the metal is likely.

In contrast, bulk commodities are suffering from the supply growth from the past two years and need higher Chinese imports to clear the market. Macquarie has once more lowered both metallurgical (coking) and thermal coal price forecasts, as a reticence to cut immediate supply and a lower cost structure in China prolong the impact of the supply overhang. The analysts observe there's some supply reaction from the coal market which should limited downside risks form current spot levels. This is not the case in iron ore, with supply continuing to exceed expectations.

UBS has revised iron ore price forecasts lower for 2014, by 9% to US$111/t. Chinese steel production is running at record rates and iron ore supply is also at record rates. Much of the steel production is ending up in the export market, signalling to UBS that domestic consumption is not as strong as the production data would suggest. UBS has reduced earnings forecasts for Australia's major iron ore producers, by 12% for Rio Tinto (RIO), by 11% for Fortescue Metals ((FMG)), and by as much as 29% for Atlas Iron ((AGO)) in FY14. Australia's strong supply response to the lift in Asian steel making activity is largely to blame for the drop in prices and UBS has retained longer-term iron ore price forecasts.

Our archive tells no lies. FNArena warned its readers well before the price of crude oil peaked in 2008 the speculator bubble would deflate with devastating   consequences for those holding oil company shares. In August we warned the most severe correction in modern history was forthcoming for natural resources.   In 2007 we warned the problem with US subprime mortgages would prove much bigger than experts and media were anticipating (among other things).
