
But lawmaking almost seems to be a prerequisite for a Texas chancellor’s post. Duncan would succeed a member of Congress/state senator, Kent Hance, at Tech. And he would join Texas A&M Chancellor John Sharp (a former state rep and senator and comptroller) on the list of former lawmakers who head Texas university systems.

The Texas State University System is headed by Brian McCall, who represented Plano and other suburban parts in the Texas House. The University of North Texas System is headed by Lee Jackson, former state rep and Dallas County judge.

The UT System is headed by a physician, Francisco Cigarroa, who announced his resignation this year. Could the UT system join the others and end up with a former lawmaker in his place? If so, I think it would be first time that an elected politician would head the UT system since the job of chancellor was created .

The job requires promoting the brand and bringing in prodigious amounts of money. Part of that is through the state Capitol, but the other is seeing the entrepreneurial opportunities, much the way that Sharp and company have moved into big pharma and landed a national bio-defense lab for College Station.

If Texas is going to consider hiring an ex-lawmaker for system chief, we may have to wait through this year’s elections to see who’s available.

The Dallas Morning News Editorial Board was the first editorial board in the nation to use a blog to openly discuss hot topics and issues among its members and with readers. Our intent is to pull back the curtain on the daily process of producing the unsigned editorials that reflect the opinion of the newspaper, and to share analysis and opinion on issues of interest to board members and invited guest bloggers.
