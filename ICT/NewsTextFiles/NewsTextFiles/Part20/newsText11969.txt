
Shoppers were left terrified when a swarm of hundreds of bees invaded an outdoor market.

The insects descended on Ashton-under-Lyne market on Sunday afternoon and baffled market traders could not explain where the huge swarm was coming from.

Tim Brockley, who was visiting Tameside for the day, spotted the bees and managed to snap a picture.

The 42-year-old bank employee who lives in Ordsall said: “They weren’t really attacking anyone, but a lot of people were scared and running away.

Luckily for Ashton’s Sunday shoppers there was no repeat of the bee attack in London earlier this week which saw shoppers surrounded and trapped by hundreds of bees.
