
WASHINGTON â The Environmental Protection Agency introduced standards on Monday aimed at reducing the billions of fish, crabs and shrimp killed by cooling water systems at power plants and factories each year.

The regulations will force more than 1,000 power plants and factories that withdraw at least 2 million gallons of water a day from adjacent waterways for cooling to take steps to minimize its toll on aquatic wildlife. Marine animals, many of them juvenile, die by being pinned or by being exposed to heat, chemicals and other stress after they are sucked inside the system. The EPA estimates 2.1 billion fish, crab and shrimp die annually.

âEPA is making it clear that if you have cooling water intakes, you have to look at the impact on aquatic life in local waterways and take steps to minimize that impact,â said Nancy Stoner, the EPA's acting assistant administrator for water, in a statement.

The rule is among a series issued by the Obama administration targeting air and water pollution from the nation's power plants, particularly coal-fired facilities. Coal-burning power plants will have limit on mercury and toxic air pollution, and will be the target of a proposal due in June to regulate the gases blamed for global warming for the first time. .

âOur experts will be examining the new rules to determine what affect they may or may not have on our operations,â said Stephanie Walton, a spokeswoman for FirstEnergy, which operates the Bruce Mansfield coal-fired power station and the Beaver Valley Unit One and Unit Two nuclear power stations along the Ohio River in Shippingport.
