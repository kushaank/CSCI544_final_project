Fast-fashion retailer H&M (short for Hennes & Mauritz) is opening a new store in Burnsville Center. Look for it this fall. The opening is part of a broader expansion by the Swedish company “in the North,” according to a news release Monday.

The 18,000-square-foot Burnsville store will feature clothing for women, men, young women and kids, and stores-within-the-store for accessories, lingerie, maternity apparel and plus-size clothing. Since opening its first stateside store on Fifth Avenue in New York 14 years ago, H&M has expanded rapidly, with more than 300 stores nationwide.

Stores locally include Mall of America, Calhoun Square, Southdale, Maplewood, Woodbury Lakes and Ridgedale.
