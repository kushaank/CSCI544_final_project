Extreme-sports camera maker GoPro filed plans on Monday to raise up to $100 million in an IPO.

The San Mateo company led by CEO Nick Woodman raised more than $200 million since it launched in 2003. It was valued at just over $2 billion when it last raised funds in 2012.

GoPro has sold more than 8.5 million cameras since it launched its first HD device in 2009, with about 45 percent of that total sold in 2013. NPD Group said it was the No. 1 selling camcorder company in the U.S. last year, commanding 45 percent of the market. It was in the top six in accessory sales, with 4 percent of that U.S. market.

The company was able to keep the details of its IPO plans secret until now using a cofidentiality provision of the JOBS Act, but it only narrowly qualified for this because its revenue nearly exceeded the rule's $1 billion limit.

GoPro's revenue more than quadrupled to $985.7 million between 2011 and 2013, a period when its profit rose more than 146 percent to $60.6 million.

But revenue dropped 7.5 percent year-to-year in the first quarter of 2014 to $235.7 million. Profit dropped by about 45 percent, year-to-year, to about $11 million.

The shares GoPro is selling in the offering are Class A common stock, which has one-tenth the voting power of the Class B shares held by insiders.
