
THE JSE was firmer at midday on Monday as local corporate earnings results impressed.

At 12.15pm the all share was up 0.4% to 49,357.68 points, with the blue-chip top 40 index rising 0.43%.

The gold index was firmly in the black, adding 2.13%. Its performance was underpinned by AngloGold Ashanti — South Africa’s largest gold miner — which delivered better than expected quarterly results.

Platinum failed to find a foothold as the strike in the sector continued — the index lost 1.23% in the midday session.

IG market analyst Shaun Murison said the local market was performing in line with US markets, which closed on a high on Friday. He said the JSE was outperforming its European peers, which were all mostly lower on the day — unable to follow Wall Street’s lead.

The UK FTSE 100 was down 0.64% and the Paris CAC 40 lowered 0.61% while the Dax shed 0.48%. Markets in Asia fared no better, with the Nikkei 225 down 0.64% at its close and the Hang Seng index closing flat, with a slightly negative bias.

"It has been a busy day on the earnings front and share price movements indicate that Barloworld and Vodacom results have disappointed, while AngloGold and Netcare results have impressed," he said.

"Although AngloGold’s more than 3% gain is in part due to a weaker rand and stronger dollar-denominated gold price, the 2% share price outperformance over its sector peers Harmony and Gold Fields highlighted its investor preference following favourable results.

"The company has managed to decrease cost by 22%, increase production by 17%, while marginally reducing net debt and generating positive free cash flow. AngloGold is showing efficacy in an environment where the gold price has been under pressure for a prolonged period," said Mr Murison.

Among individual shares, diversified industrial group Barloworld was down 0.98% to R111.48. The company earlier said it had managed to grow its revenue 5% to R29.9bn in the six months to March 2014.

Bidvest was up 1.2% to R293.48.

AngloGold Ashanti rose 3.18% to R181.53 and rival Harmony inched up 1.2% to R33.65.

Unsecured lender African Bank Investments Limited delivered no surprises when it announced a headline loss of R3.1bn in the six months to March from earnings of R604m in the year-earlier period, citing a tough operating environment.

Its share price rose 3.55% to R8.75, after having fallen about 30% when it first flagged an expected loss on May 2.

Investment company Reinet gained 2.75% to R25.07. On Monday, Reinet reported that its net asset value per ordinary share for the year ended March 2014 increased to €21‚ from €20.53 previously. Reinet proposed an initial dividend of €0.153 per ordinary share for the period. An ordinary share represents 10 shares on Reinet’s JSE listing.

Poultry producer Astral Foods rose 2.31% to R104.10c. Astral reported a 308% jump in diluted headline earnings per share to 386c for its six months ended March‚ off a low base in the prior interim period. Astral said the increase in headline earnings‚ from R35.9m for the previous year’s first six months to R148.8m‚ "was attributable to the turnaround in the profitability of the poultry division".
