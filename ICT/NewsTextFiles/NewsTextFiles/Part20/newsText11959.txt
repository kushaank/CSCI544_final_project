
The Queensland Resources Council says claims about a lack of scientific scrutiny surrounding dredging and seabed placement don’t stack up.

Commenting on news today that a tourism industry body is mounting a legal challenge against the dredging approval for Abbot Point coal terminal in north Queensland, QRC Chief Executive Michael Roche said scientifically peer-reviewed studies specific to Abbot Point and of a broader nature were readily available.

‘Some 20 scientific studies and appendices covering the cumulative impact of the Abbot Port coal terminal expansion were presented to governments in 2012 and published,’ Mr Roche said.

‘To date, not one of these studies – including on dredge plume modelling and water quality – has been questioned in terms of their scientific validity.

Mr Roche said he hoped a new round of ‘infomercials’ putting the Abbot Point coal terminal dredging program into geographical perspective would assist the public in becoming better informed about the facts surrounding current and future management of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.
