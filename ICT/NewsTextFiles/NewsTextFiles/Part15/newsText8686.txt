
A dog that was reported missing after a man's online date abruptly left his apartment was returned.

On Wednesday between 1:30 p.m. and 4 p.m., a woman visited a man at his home in the 4200 block of Derby Wharf Drive in Virginia Beach. They had met through an online dating app, according to a Virginia Beach police news release.

But when she left to retrieve something from her car and didn't return, he realized that his pomeranian named LaLa was missing.

Police said that since the dog has been returned, the man did not want to press charges.
