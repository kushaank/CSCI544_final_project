
Monday, May 18, 2014 -- United States Steel Corp. CEO Mario Longhi said tens of thousands of steel jobs are at risk if the Department of Commerce does not take action on the surge of dumped imports of oil country tubular goods, which are used in pipelines and for energy exploration. On Monday, U.S. Steel hosted a rally at its Research and Technology Center in Munhall to raise awareness for the issue. Between 2010 and 2012, imports from nine countries into the U.S. More than doubled from 850,000 tons to 1.8 million tons, according to the Alliance for American Manufacturing.
