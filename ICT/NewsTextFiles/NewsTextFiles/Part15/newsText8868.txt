
SINGAPORE: Japan has told Pacific trading partners it will not abolish tariffs in the five agricultural sectors it considers sacred, the countryâ€™s economy minister, Akira Amari, said on Monday.

Japan and the 11 other countries negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) on Tuesday wrap up a two-day meeting in Singapore, hoping to make headway on the ambitious trade pact after the United States and Japan reported progress last month on overcoming long-running differences on tariffs.

However, Amari said, despite the progress in negotiations with the US, Japan will not agree to abolish tariffs on wheat, rice, dairy, sugar, beef and pork (counted as one), but he added that Japan still hoped to contribute to a high-quality pact.
