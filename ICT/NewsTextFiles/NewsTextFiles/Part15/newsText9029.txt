OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) - A group showed their anger over a sentence they called too lenient for a man who admitted being drunk as he led police on a high-speed chase through downtown Olympia in his Ferrari last year.

Goodman was sentenced to a year of work release. Under the conditions of his sentence, he can leave to work at his company during the day but must return at night to the Thurston County Jail.

He pleaded guilty to drunken driving and eluding police after the Dec. 29 chase that ended when he crashed his car into a parked car and a home. His blood-alcohol level measured 0.16, twice the Washington state threshold for drunken driving.

During sentencing, Goodman ’s attorney, Paul Strophy , noted that his client owns a business and that his employees rely on him to show up for work to make sure the business runs smoothly.

The sentence was a joint recommendation by Thurston County prosecutor James Powers and Strophy .

The Olympian reported that Goodman ’s December arrest was his seventh for driving under the influence, but that two of those cases had been reduced to negligent driving convictions.

Goodman needs to learn to stop drinking and driving, Thurston County Superior Court Judge Christine Schaller said in her acceptance of the sentencing recommendation earlier this month.

Henry Griffin, a passenger who had accepted a ride from Goodman at a tavern and escaped by jumping from the moving vehicle when it slowed, was among those protesting the sentence on Friday.

“I thought I was going to die, 100 percent,” Griffin said.

While Goodman ’s case was pending in January, another judge signed an order modifying Goodman ’s conditions of release so he could fly to New Jersey and watch the Seattle Seahawks beat the Denver Broncos in the Super Bowl.
