Gateway Foursquare Church loaned this van to McKenzie Gilberts, Kourtney Gaylen, Alicia Zieg and Jessika Notari for their cross-country mission to help churches, communities and families. They left Salem on Sunday, May 18, 2014, and are planning to be gone for two months.

A local church provided transportation for a group of young women who left this past weekend on a two-month mission to help churches, communities and families across the country.

Gateway Foursquare Church, which learned about their need for a vehicle in a story published last week in the Statesman Journal, loaned them a 15-passenger van.

"There's a cool story behind it," Alicia Zieg said. "The pastor, his daughter, went on a road trip like ours. She used it for her ministry, a mobile church."

Zieg and three friends — Kourtney Galyen, McKenzie Gilberts and Jessika Notari — are on a mission called "Dare You to Move." They loaded up the white van on Sunday and left Salem for their planned 11,022-mile journey.

Their first scheduled stop is in Des Moines, Wash., and then they are headed to Montana and Wyoming.
