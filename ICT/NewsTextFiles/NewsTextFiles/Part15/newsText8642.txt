Police say a Connecticut man stabbed his estranged wife in West New York today after stalking her through three states before apparently stabbing himself in North Bergen, officials say.

The married Connecticut couple were separated and the woman left Connecticut for Pennsylvania but the husband allegedly stalked her to that state, West New York spokesman Pablo Fonseca said, quoting police.

The woman then left Pennsylvania and went to the home of a friend in West New York, but the husband allegedly followed her to Hudson County, Fonseca said. The wife was staying at the friend’s home when today’s attack occurred at about 6:30 p.m. on Bergenline Avenue, Fonseca said.

Emergency responder radio transmissions said the woman was stabbed in the back and Fonseca said someone got the attacker’s vehicle license plate number as he fled, setting off a manhunt, Fonseca said.

The vehicle was tracked down to the Home Depot on Tonnelle Avenue in North Bergen, where the husband was found suffering from an apparently self-inflicted knife wound, Fonseca said.

The woman was taken to the Jersey City Medical Center where she was considered to be in life-threatening condition but has since been ruled in stable condition, Fonseca said. The husband was also taken to the Medical Center where he remains listed in critical condition, Fonseca said.

Information on the identities of the two individuals is not yet available, Fonseca said at 9:30 p.m.
