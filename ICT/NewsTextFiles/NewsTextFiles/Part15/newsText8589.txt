Think of it as Sidecar for the skies.

A new app aims to provide a helicopter lift from Manhattan to the Hamptons for less by helping travelers “crowdsource” their own flights.

The iPhone app, called Blade, will allow users to book a seat on an existing flight with just a few screen taps.

If none of the scheduled flights work, people can launch their own charter flight at a specified time using Blade to help fill the open seats.

Blade flights can cost as little as $450 a seat, according to general manager Evan Licht, while a typical seat on a Hamptons-bound helicopter might cost upward of $3,000.

Even better, Blade customers will receive a plastic cup of rose wine or a water bottle, along with a complimentary copy of The Post and the ability to charge their phones.

Another bonus: Blade has partnered with Maserati of NYC/Long Island to provide car service for times when bad weather cancels the flight.

Meanwhile, if you have three hours to spare, a ticket on the Hampton Jitney is $30, or, if you prepay, $28 a pop.

Blade bears some similarities to ride-sharing app Sidecar, which matches drivers with people nearby looking for rides. But unlike with taxi app Uber, the prices aren’t dictated by peak demand.

With Blade, there are no surprises as flights are displayed by date, time and price, Licht said.

“We want to make it approachable and easy and transparent for young people who think only billionaires fly planes,” Licht told The Post.

Blade is backed by Liberty Helicopter — a familiar sight to most New Yorkers — and two other tech investors who want to remain unnamed.

Blade will take off from the heliport on the East Side and land in South Hampton, East Hampton and Montauk. The flights return to the West Side heliport in Midtown.

The service is expected to run at least through Labor Day.
