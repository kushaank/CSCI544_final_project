
A Pennsylvania man faces several charges for tattooing a smiley face on the arm of a 12-year-old girl.

Pennsylvania State Police told The Titusville Herald that the girl was spending the night at the home of Randall Charlton III, 33, of Centerville, Penn., Wednesday when she got the yellow happy face inking, along with a "derogatory word above it," on her left forearm.

Charlton is charged with unlawful tattooing, endangering the welfare of a minor, corruption of minors, aggravated assault and simple assault.

He appeared in court Friday and bail was set at $20,000.
