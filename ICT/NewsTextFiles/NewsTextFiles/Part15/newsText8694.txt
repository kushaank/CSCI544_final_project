
Day 1: spent at Venice Beach, beautiful sunny day, walked long the canals. Ate dinner at a Vietnamese / French restaurant - best meal so far, and had French champagne (ofcourse).

Day 2: at Universal studios, fantastic day. Heaps to do, shows, rides, tours and just looking around at the sets etc.

The rides were awesome: Simpsons, Minions & Transformers were all simulated rides....brilliantly done. Transformers was the most action packed, a space fight (Ricks favourite), the Simpsons was a roller coaster gone rogue (my favourite) and the Minions was a conveyor belt / roller coaster type ride, all great rides! House of Horrors was funny...and a few scares! Rick did the real roller coaster (The Mummy ride).

The studio tour was brilliant, the King Kong tunnel is fantastic....so realistic with dinosaurs and King Kong fighting and attacking the tram car. The sets were great and entertaining with a Norman Bates scene and a a visit from Jaws.....loved this tour.

Left LA and headed South to San Clemente (about 30 mins past Anaheim). Quaint little beach side town.
