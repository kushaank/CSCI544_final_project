
The California Republican Party has nowhere to go but up, and there are reasons to think its climb will start with this year’s elections.

One reason: The scandals involving three Democratic state senators could weigh down other Democratic candidates.

Another reason: Republicans have at least two candidates with a chance to break Democrats’ lock on statewide offices, namely Pete Peterson and Ashley Swearengin, whom the Los Angeles News Group editorial board endorsed for secretary of state and controller, respectively, in the June 3 primary.

And one more reason: Republican voters could turn out in higher proportions than Democratic voters if California sees the effects of higher enthusiasm among Republicans nationally going into the 2014 congressional elections.

Some recent headlines have been favorable to the state’s Democratic leaders. The economy is rebounding, though slower than anybody hoped, and the budget is balanced.

But the biggest headlines have been about Democrats embroiled in scandal. Sen. Ron Calderon, D-Montebello, is accused of taking bribes; Sen. Leland Yee, D-San Francisco, is accused of taking bribes and orchestrating weapons trafficking, and Sen. Rod Wright, D-Inglewood, awaits sentencing for living outside his district and lying about it.

Many see such egregious misbehavior as signs of hubris in the party that dominates California government — and proof of the need to chip away at Democrats’ dominance.

In the top state race on the ballot, Gov. Jerry Brown’s re-election bid looks strong in polls. The best news for Republican voters there is that GOP candidates Tim Donnelly and Neel Kashkari offer a stark choice about the ideological direction of the party.

But down-ticket, Republicans may find hope.

We’ll publish as many responses as possible in Sunday’s newspaper and online.
