
SUFFOLK -- Police will hold a public information meeting on Thursday to provide information related to recent bear sightings in Suffolk.

Citizens who encounter bears are advised to contact the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, remove the food source/trash cans, or to call Suffolk Animal Control when the bear is seen so that officials can come out to make sure it’s not a public safety issue.

Because of bears’ natural distrust of humans, a bear that feels cornered will be looking for an escape route.  By keeping people and pets away from the bear, you give it the best chance to come down from the tree and leave your property on its own.

A biologist from the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries will be at the meeting to answer questions regarding bear activity and preventative tips for the public.

The meeting will take place May 22 from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. in the library at Nansemond River High School.

For more information contact Captain James Buie at 757-514-7960.
