
DALEVILLE, Ala Authorities are investigating a weekend fire that caused extensive damage to a church in southeast Alabama.

Witnesses reported seeing flames coming from the Daleville First United Methodist Church at about 2 a.m. Sunday. Church members gathered outside the burned sanctuary after daybreak for an outdoor worship service.

Krissy Thorne, whose family has attended the church for more than 20 years, said, "It's like losing your home."

Scott Pilgreen of the Alabama Fire Marshal's Office says state and local authorities are investigating. He says it's too early to say what caused the fire or whether foul play could be involved.
