
A federal judge struck down Oregon’s gay marriage ban as unconstitutional on Monday, allowing state officials to start marrying couples immediately. U.S. District Judge Michael McShane ordered Oregon not to enforce the ban as it, he wrote, violates the Fourteenth Amendment. The state ban was challenged by four gay and lesbian couples in the state. Couples have been lined up outside Portland’s county clerk’s office to retrieve their marriage licenses, and here are some of the first photos of the state’s first same-sex marriages, and the very Oregonian reaction to the news.

And free pedicabs ride to mark this momentous day.
