
OGLESBY — Keeping with a “future trends” theme, the North Central Illinois Logistics Council (NCILC) Program offers something unique that could help area logistics and cartage companies boost their bottom line.

The NCILC and the American Power Group are hosting a presentation on “dual-fuel,” an innovative bridge technology relating to the use of natural gas as a transportation fuel in heavy duty applications such as Class 8 trucks or “semis.” Speakers from industry-leading organizations will cover topics such as comparisons of compressed natural gas (CNG) versus liquefied natural gas (LNG); natural gas-related economic, environmental, storage, delivery, and pricing matters; and general information about dedicated natural gas vehicles.

The meeting will be at 8 a.m. Thursday, May 22 in Room CTC 125 of the new Community Technology Center on the campus of IVCC in Oglesby. The meeting is open to the public, and there is no charge to attend. A dual-fuel Glider truck will be on site for public viewing in the parking lot behind the Community Technology Center.
