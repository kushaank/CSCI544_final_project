
Last fall, Talia Maselli wrote to invite Vice President Joe Biden to her high school prom in Newington, Conn. Biden couldn't make it, but sent a handwritten card and a corsage he picked out — baby's breath, white roses and red, white and blue ribbons. The package arrived at the Masellis' home Thursday, a day before the prom. The family thought it was a prank. "But then we called the number that came with it, and it was his personal secretary," said Maselli, 18. "I was just shocked." Maselli said the invitation began as a joke with her friends. She said she thought Biden was funny and "would be fun to hang out with." She didn't go to her prom, as planned. "I could only tolerate a high school dance if I was to be escorted by the most delightful man in all of America — Joe Biden," she wrote. "I fear if you turn me down, I may have to invite Speaker John Boehner, and we can't have that now can we." Biden's office is arranging for Maselli to meet him at the White House in July.

Police say a woman trying to keep her family from learning she had dropped out of college called in bomb threats to a commencement ceremony at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut. Danielle Shea, 22, of Quincy, Mass., was wearing a cap and gown when she was arrested Sunday. Hamden police said Shea's mother was paying thousands of dollars she thought was for her daughter's education, but Shea left college this year because of financial issues, including an unpaid tuition balance. "She was living off-campus," police Capt. Ronald Smith said.
