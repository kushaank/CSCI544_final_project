
Hawaii health insurers blame losses on 'Obamacare'

HONOLULU (AP)  Hawaii's two largest health insurers are reporting $36 million in losses during the first quarter and blaming it on fees required by the federal Affordable Care Act.

The companies said Friday those fees may lead to higher costs for customers.

Hawaii Medical Services Association posted losses of $30.1 million in the first quarter and said it recorded $46.1 million in fees related to Obamacare.

Kaiser Permanente reports losing $5.8 million and paying $8 million in fees.

Both companies reported their quarterly earnings to Hawaii's insurance commissioner.

HMSA spokeswoman Robyn Kuraoka says the company has proposed increasing premiums by an average 13 percent.

Kaiser Spokeswoman Laura Lott says it's too early to say whether the losses will result in higher premiums, but like any organization, Kaiser has to cover costs.
