VINCENNES, Ind. (WTHI) –      Summer Break is so close Vincennes Community school students can almost feel the sunshine. But it’s a dim reminder for some kids. When school lets out corporation cafeterias will close. And that’s a problem.

“We felt like the need was there and the 5,500 not only confirmed it, but solidified it,” said Vincennes Community School Superintendent Greg Parsley.

Parsley is working on a program to get kids a bite to eat and joined forces with Sodexo Nutrition Services General Manager Mike Szady.

“This is our second year participating in the summer feeding program,” Szady.

The program, which turned out to be a tremendous hit, served 5,500 meals. Supertiendent Greg Parsley stated the corporation educates around 2,700 hundred kids.

“Bottom line is, if they are a kid, they are going to get a free meal,” said Parsley.

In its second year, the school corporation will make a change, by adding an adult meal to the menu. Adults can join their children and eat for the cost of $2.00.

“Now that we can include the parents along with the students, I think we’ll only increase our numbers, maybe even get more students out, knowing that the parents can get a meal as well,” said Parsley.

Feeding locations will open in school cafeteria’s around the city, and will also include Washington Christian Academy, which sits next Gregg Park.

The park is home to the in-progress Rainbow Beach Pool which is scheduled to open Memorial Day Weekend. The soon-to-open pool will likely welcome a mass of Vincennes Community School Corporation students enjoying summer break. School administrators say it’s a prime opportunity and location to make sure students stay fed.
