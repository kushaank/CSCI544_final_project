
The Wright Amendment prevents Southwest from Dallas flying over nearby destinations like Albuquerque.

Officials at the Albuquerque International Sunport told Target 7 recently that they were preparing for the cuts. The Sunport is working on ways to lower operating costs to offset the losses from Southwest.

Southwest makes up 58 percent of the Albuquerque International Sunport's air traffic. American Airlines comes in a distant second at 16 percent.

The Sunport makes money when Southwest leases space for gates, ticket counters and each time a flight lands. If Southwest scales back, that's less money for the Sunport.

Depending on travel season, the airline could cut up to 11 flights out of the Sunport.
