BRADENTON, Fla. - A Florida couple found a big surprise when they went to their backyard pool, an alligator!

Sharon Bente heard a noise outside her Bradenton, Fla., home at about 4 a.m. Thursday. She checked it out and found an 8-foot gator taking a dip in her pool.

She and her husband, John, quickly called their local sheriffâ€™s office.

The gator gained access to the pool by tearing through a screen on their patio.

The reptile was trapped and taken to a farm in Arcadia.
