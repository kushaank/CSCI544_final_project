
ATLANTA (AP) — Former Dollar General CEO David Perdue says his rivals in the GOP race for Georgia's open Senate seat are falsely accusing him of being the worst kind of Republican — one who wants to raise taxes.

In Saturday's final debate before Tuesday's primary, Perdue accused his opponents of leveling the most outrageous of charges. He offered a previous pledge not to increase taxes as evidence of his standing on the issue.

One of his opponents, congressman Jack Kingston, says the pledge isn't enough. Kingston and others accuse Perdue of supporting higher taxes.

Perdue, who is leading in polls, said a few days ago that increasing revenue as well as cutting spending is needed to address the country's fiscal problems.

Kingston tells Perdue -- quote, "You can't have it both ways."
