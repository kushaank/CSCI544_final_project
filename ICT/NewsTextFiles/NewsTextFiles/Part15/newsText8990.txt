
After 25 years of serving Irish breakfast in West Portal, neighborhood staple Village Grill is slated to close by the end of the month.

Owners Robbie Connolly and Richard Crain are selling the place to Eddie Naser and the group that operates three Toast Eatery locations in San Francisco; the sale is currently in escrow.

“It’s been 25 years next month and we’d like to do something different,” says Connolly, adding that it’s time for a vacation.

He says that the reaction from the Village Grill regulars has been sad, but most are happy for them. He hopes that the new regime will continue the Irish breakfast tradition, as well as lunch and a new dinner service.

The exact end date isn’t set in stone, but Connolly says it will likely take place near the end of the month, though it might happen earlier. No word yet on further plans from the Toast side.
