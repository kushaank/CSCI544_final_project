
On May 7 and 8, the city of Statesville, in partnership with Diakonos Inc. and the N.C. Department of Public Safety, hosted an unprecedented training event at the Statesville Civic Center — the 2014 Iredell Symposium on Domestic Violence. By all accounts, it was a huge success. Never before had such a multidisciplinary training event addressing such an important topic been available in our area. Nearly 400 people from across the state attended this event to receive training on how to effectively respond to domestic violence in the workplace; as a law enforcement officer, judicial official, health care or victim service provider; training on North Carolina laws related to domestic violence; teen dating violence; and best practices being implemented in other areas of the US.

The symposium opened the door to great things in terms of a coordinated community response to domestic violence in Iredell County, and now it is up to all of us to step through it and make the necessary changes to “the system” in order to provide the most efficient and effective services to the victims, hold offenders more accountable and keep our children safe from domestic abuse.
