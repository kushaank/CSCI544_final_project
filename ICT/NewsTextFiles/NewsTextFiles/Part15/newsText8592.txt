NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. (AP) - More than 100 members of an Air Force Reserve unit are scheduled to arrive home in western New York after spending the past several months overseas.

Airmen in the 914th Airlift Wing are returning aboard two aircraft scheduled to land Monday morning at the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station. Members of the wingâ€™s operations and maintenance units were deployed to Southwest Asia earlier this year.

While overseas the airmen supported U.S. military operations by performing aircraft maintenance, medical evacuations and combat cargo deliveries.
