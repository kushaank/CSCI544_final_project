
The testimony of New Zealand woman Mary Quin, kidnapped in Yemen in 1998, has been used to help convict firebrand cleric Abu Hamza of terror charges.

The evidence of New Zealand woman Mary Quin has helped a jury in New York find cleric Abu Hamza guilty of kidnapping and terror charges.

Abu Hamza, 56, whose real name is Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, now faces a possible life sentence after the guilty verdict on all 11 charges he faced.

The jury deliberated for 12 hours before reaching a verdict, after a four-week trial in which Abu Hamza took the stand for three days.

Ms Quin, one of 16 tourists snatched by Islamist kidnappers in Yemen in 1998, told the terror trial of the former imam of the Finsbury Park mosque in North London that he justified the kidnapping and killing of civilians in defence of Islam.

Ms Quin, now chief executive of the Callaghan Innovation Fund, interviewed Abu Hamza in October 2000 while researching her book on her ordeal, Kidnapped in Yemen.

Four hostages were killed during the two-hour rescue operation.

Ms Quin said Abu Hamza told her that the chief kidnapper, Abu Hasan, called him during the kidnapping and that he advised him to stay back to avoid being killed during the Yemen army's rescue operation.

Abu Hamza, who is blind in one eye and had both hands blown off in an explosion in Afghanistan, faced charges which included trying to set up a jihad training camp in Oregon and sending support and fighters to al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.

He denied the charges but said he did use strong language in his sermons and speeches.

He has already served six years in Britain for inciting hatred and soliciting murder.
