
A Fort Lauderdale woman with an outstanding warrant was arrested in Palm Beach over the weekend after cops found weed in her vagina. The woman had gotten into a heated dispute with a Palm Beach homeowner for "services."

And, according to one report, the home where the woman was arrested belongs to the owner of Gunster Law Firm, a Palm Beach County firm that handles business needs.

According to a PBSO report, cops were called to the home located on 156 Seagate Road during a civil disturbance around 3 a.m. Sunday.

Police say Jessica Johnston, 25, and two other women said that the owner of the home owed her $500 for "services" but that he paid her only $380.

According to the police report, Johnston listed "chef and companion" as her profession.

Cops told Johnston and the women that their complaint was a civil matter.

But as they questioned her further, police noticed that Johnston had an outstanding warrant out in her name. Before arresting her, an officer asked Johnston if she had any drugs on her person. She then confessed to having a bag of weed stuffed inside her vagina.

A female officer witnessed Johnston remove a clear plastic bag containing what was allegedly 2.6 grams of marijuana from her vagina.

But the story apparently doesn't end there.

According to Gossip Extra , the home on 156 Seagate is a $1.1 million property that belongs to Richard Holt, a shareholder of Gunster Law .

Holt's name is not mentioned in the police report. But the Gossip Extra report says that property records show the home where Johnston was arrested belongs to him.

Johnston was booked into the Palm Beach County Jail on charges of failure to appear and possession of marijuana not more than 20 grams.
