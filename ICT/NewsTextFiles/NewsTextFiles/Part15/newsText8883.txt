To        participate, restaurant guests donate $1 in support of military        charities. For each $1 donation, guests receive a commemorative “I am        supporting military veterans and families” patriotic star-shaped cut out        to personalize and place on display in the restaurant. They also receive        restaurant coupons valued at more than $10 to use toward future        purchases.
