Firehouse Subs –are getting closer to opening in Tupelo.

• First, there’s the Wingstop that we first told you about in January, is set to open in early June.

We talked to Tanner Berryhill, one of the three partners with the Wingstop franchise that’s opening stores this year in Tupelo, Starkville and Oxford. Two more are slated for Tuscaloosa. Berryhill’s business partners are John Albriton and Jay Misenheimer.

The store is taking applications this week at its Tupelo location at the corner of West Main and Thomas streets. It will employ about 25 people. Applications also will be taken on Memorial Day.

The dining area will have seating for about 65 people. The restaurant will obviously serve wings – fresh, never frozen, Berryhill said – and also beer. Frieds are hand-cut, and sides are made fresh.

“We’re quality-driven,” Berryhill said.

Signs should be going up this week, said franchise owner Chris Stephenson, who also owns the Oxford Firehouse Subs.
