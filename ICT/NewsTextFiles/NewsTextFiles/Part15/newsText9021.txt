
Rocky Mount, N.C. — On a day where others turn to church for healing, Pastor James Gailliard, despite his own personal tragedy, was there to soothe others.

His oldest son, Kyol Gailliard, 27, was among three people killed early Friday morning when their vehicle crashed into a brick building and burst into flames at the intersection of South Grace and Chester streets.

Kyol Gailliard controlled the sound board at Word Tabernacle Church, where his father is the senior pastor.

As the elder Gailliard looked to the balcony while preaching Sunday, it was another painful reminder of what happened just two days earlier.

Kyol Gailliard was in the vehicle with Jason Britt and Dennis Battle Jr. – all three were musicians and "PKs," or preachers kids. Relatives and friends of the three men said the vehicle hydroplaned before crashing into the building. Investigators have not said whether the crash, which remains under investigation, is weather related. No other vehicles were involved, police said.

James Gailliard addressed the incident during one of his services.

So sad - didn't know it was Pastor Gilliard's son.  Praying for all the families - let God wrap His arms around them and tell them "it's going to be okay, I'm here."

What a difficult situation.  Prayers for all involved.
