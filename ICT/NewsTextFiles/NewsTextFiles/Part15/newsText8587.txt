The best view of New York City on Sunday was from the air, as five Red Bull Air Force Wingsuit Flyers accomplished their dream of skydiving from above one of the world’s most recognizable skylines - Manhattan.

The flight was in anticipation of the 2014 Bethpage Air Show at Jones Beach in Long Island this Memorial Day Weekend.

The elite aerial athletes of the Red Bull Air Force, who have performed at the locations in the world, started at the southern tip of the island, jumping from a plane at an altitude of 7,500 feet.

They were traveling at speeds of about 120 mph and headed uptown, passing the skyscrapers of the Financial District.

It finished with the crew landing on a barge in the Hudson River.

The troop was made up of Wingsuit Flyers Jon Devore, Jeff Provenzano, Amy Chmelecki, Sean MacCormac and Andy Farrington are part of the Red Bull Air Force (RBAF).

'It’s been years of looking up at the big buildings and wondering if there is a day that I can fly over them.

'That day was today.'
