
Columbus — About 1.34 million Ohioans are expected travel at least 50 miles from home over the long Memorial Day weekend, the most since before the onset of the recession, according to the AAA Ohio Auto Club.

The travel volume — which would be about 0.6 percent higher than the Memorial Day weekend a year ago in the state — is due to an improved economy and more people wanting to get out of town after the long, cold winter, AAA said. For travel purposes, the holiday weekend is considered to be Thursday through Monday.

About 90 percent of Ohioans traveling, or about 1.2 million, are expected to drive to their destinations. Gas prices aren’t expected to be a factor because they’re in line with last year. About 73,000 Ohioans are expected to travel by air during the weekend. Another 62,000 or so are expected to travel by other means, including cruises, trains and buses.
