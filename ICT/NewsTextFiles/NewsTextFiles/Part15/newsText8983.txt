
It took six years for Horizon Health to open Freedom Village, an inpatient treatment center just for veterans, but supporters say it was well worth the wait.

Though the 25-bed facility in Sanborn began accepting patients late last year, an official grand opening May 16 brought out dozens of veterans and supporters.

That includes former patients and families impacted by drug and alcohol addiction eager to shake the hands of staffers and board members who worked to get the site open despite multiple funding delays.

Since its opening, the facility has operated at or near capacity, with the current residents coming from a wide variety of backgrounds and military experience and ranging in age from 23-67.

Horizon Health also operates a 50-bed Horizon Village inpatient facility on the campus, but the new site offers veterans a community of like-minded individuals, said Patrick Welch , a veterans advocate and board chairman at Horizon Health.

The facility is the second veterans-only facility in the state and the first to be opened by a nonprofit agency. Anne Constantino , CEO at Horizon Health, cited the support of veterans groups throughout the region, and ongoing collaboration with the Veterans One-stop Center of Western New York in Buffalo, the VA WNY Healthcare System and the Veteransâ€™ Treatment Court, one of three specialized court programs in Buffalo.
