TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) - State lottery officials say a $2 million winning ticket was sold to a player in northeast Kansas during the weekend Powerball drawing.

Officials declined to say Monday exactly where the ticket was drawn. The lottery's northeast Kansas zone covers 21 counties.

The winning ticket matched the first five numbers drawn Saturday, which were 23-32-39-47-49. The Powerball was 22. The player also purchased a Power Play option which doubled the prize from $1 million to $2 million.

No ticket sold matched all the numbers in drawing. The jackpot for Wednesday's drawing will be an estimated $114 million.
