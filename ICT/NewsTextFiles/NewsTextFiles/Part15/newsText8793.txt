What almost no one remembers is his experimentation with a now obsolete computer called the Amiga. As VOA’s Kane Farabaugh reports, the art Warhol created on that computer might have been lost forever, if not for the partnership between Carnegie Mellon University, the Carnegie Museum of Art, and The Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA— Long-lost modified digital images by pop culture artist Andy Warhol have been rediscovered, thanks to a collaboration among Carnegie Mellon University , the Carnegie Museum of Art , and The Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

The images are being retrieved from a 1985 Commodore Amiga computer.

“They had a level of simplicity often times that we don’t see in modern computers anymore,” Bare said.

Back to 1985, the Commodore Amiga was the newest and greatest computer.

After some reverse software engineering, they hit pay dirt: the Warhol digital art few had seen before.

The iconic images of a digital Campbell’s soup can and Warhol’s self-portrait are just a few of some 20 images recovered from floppy disks.
