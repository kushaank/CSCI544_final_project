Brad Flory column: What makes a transplant pass for a 'true Jacksonian'

JACKSON, MI – It feels awkward to receive a compliment that is factually untrue.

Such a moment happened last week, when someone called me a "true Jacksonian."

I was neither born nor raised in Jackson. I did not go to school in Jackson. I married my wife in Jackson and we resided in the city for a time, but long ago we moved to the Greater Leslie Metropolitan Area because it is halfway between our jobs.

On the other hand, perhaps the Jackson influence has rubbed off on me.

I've spent far more waking hours in Jackson than in any other town. Working for the newspaper, I had the opportunity to meet thousands of great Jackson people, and a few jerks.

I sat down to list ways in which I might be confused with a "true Jacksonian."

* Never once have I gone to Ann Arbor to buy anything. It sounds silly, but I am vaguely proud of that.

* No matter how hard I try to keep up with changes, I still say "Paka Plaza" and "Foote Hospital."

* Come to think of it, I don't try particularly hard to keep up with those kinds of changes.

* I never saw the Regent Café, the Brown Hut, or Pat's Hamburgs, but I know what people are talking about when they reminisce about them.

* The aroma of Casler Hardware delights me.

* Government rules to protect me from myself seem so wrong that sometimes I disable safety features on my lawn mower. Live free or die! I just hope when I die it's not in a freak grass-cutting tragedy.

* Given a choice, I would rather spend vacation time beside a placid lake than inside a busy city. If I went fishing, I'd use a worm and a bobber.

* I know which city streets to avoid because the road surface is in terrible condition, and it's getting to be a lot to remember.

* Once I asked Chris St. John, owner of Jackson Monument Works, if it is technologically feasible to put a Coney Island hot dog on my gravestone. He said yes, but my wife refuses to allow it. Still, it's something to remember if I outlive her.

* I call the store "Meijers," even though it has no "s" in the name.

* When I hear about a restaurant that serves absurdly big portions of anything, my first instinct is to go there and eat it.

* Finally, and most conclusively, I felt praised when called a "true Jacksonian."

With all those credentials, maybe the compliment was not entirely false.
