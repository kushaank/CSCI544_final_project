
The tour is entitled Dressed to Kill, and the 67-year-old still makes her way around the stage with the youthful exuberance and flair that got her attention as she made a name for herself in the 70s. This concert is in the beginning of Leg 2 of her North American jaunt, which will take her to stadiums from coast-to-coast and allow her to perform in front of adoring fans for one last time.

It has been confirmed by the starlet herself that this will be her final solo tour, so fans are encouraged to take advantage of the many affordable Cher ticket opportunities now at TicketProcess.com .
