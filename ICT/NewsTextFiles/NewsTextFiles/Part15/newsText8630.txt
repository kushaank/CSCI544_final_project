Marion County Elections ballot drop site outside the Marion County Courthouse in downtown Salem Tuesday, May 15, 2012.

Less than 20 percent of voters in Marion and Polk Counties have returned their ballots, but that's on track with statewide voting trends from previous primaries , according to online data from the Secretary of State's Office.

"There a lot of people who show up at the last minute. It just happens," said Ed Dover, a political science professor at Western Oregon University. "I don't think they are undecided; they just haven't gotten around to filling out the ballot."

As of Sunday, according to the secretary of state's unofficial ballot returns, 19.9 percent of registered Oregonians had voted in the May 20 primary.

Average historical ballot return percentage by day for the all of Oregon leading up to election day for primary elections from 2002 through 2012.

* Includes all returns from the Friday-Sunday prior to election day.

In the 2012 primary, an additional 20 percent of Oregonians returned their ballots during the final days of voting, including 11 percent of people who voted on election day itself.

In Marion County, 16.6 percent of voters (24,373 people) had returned their ballots by Friday afternoon. In Polk County, the count stood at 19.02 percent.

Slow returns have been the hallmark of Oregon elections since the state shifted to the vote by mail system, Dover said.

He thinks we will see a normal turnout (between 35 to 40 percent) for a primary.
