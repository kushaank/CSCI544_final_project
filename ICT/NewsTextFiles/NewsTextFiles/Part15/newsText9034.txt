
State health officials identified a case of E. coli O157 in western Massachusetts Monday.

The illness was connected to the recent multi-state USDA recall that impacted 1.8 million pounds of ground beef, according to Anne Roach, the media relations manager for the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.

The victim of the incident was identified as a Hampshire County resident, but in order to protect patient privacy the name or age of the victim was not released.

Roache advised that individuals only eat meat that was cooked to a minimum temperature of 160 degrees.

The multi-state investigation is ongoing. CBS 3 Springfield will bring you updates as they are made available.
