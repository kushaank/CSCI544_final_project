
Every year, thousands gather in Pauls Valley, Oklahoma for the truly odd Okie Noodling Contest: the culmination of 24 frantic hours where brave folks from across the region get wet and muddy as they shove their fists into lakes and rivers in the hopes they'll pull it back out with a prizewinning catfish.

Noodlers wave their arms around in a catfish hole. If all goes according to plan, the fish will latch onto the arm as a defensive measure and the noodler can bring the fish in. The arm-as-bait method means the sport isn't for the faint hearted.

In the most recent contest, the brave soul who fisted the largest catch was an intrepid 19-year-old woman named Lucy Millsap who drove her 72-pound flathead catfish three hours to show-off at the contest and ultimately take first prize and $1,500.

This series of beautiful photos from photographer Matt Rainwaters showcases the surprisingly diverse fan base of the distinctively southern sport as well as their prize handfishing catches.
