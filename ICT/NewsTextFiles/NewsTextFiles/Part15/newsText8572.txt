CAMDENTON , Mo. (AP) - A 28-year-old St. Louis woman is dead and her estranged husband faces a murder charge after a weekend stabbing inside a home near the Lake of the Ozarks.

Police say Danielle Bell died early Sunday morning after an alcohol-fueled argument with her husband, Calvin E. Kyles , 50, a recent transplant from St. Louis . Danielle Bell was a temporary lake resident who had returned to Camdenton on Friday, KMOV-TV (bit.ly/1t9P2FR ) reported.

Calvin Kyles is charged with first-degree murder and armed criminal action in his wife’s death. He remained in jail Monday afternoon without bond and did not yet have a lawyer, according to online court records.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported Monday that Kyles moved to Camden County about one year ago. He told police the couple had been married for eight years.

Court records indicate the argument began Saturday night at a bar and continued when the pair returned to Kyles ‘ home.

Kyles was arrested several hours later by a St. Clair County deputy sheriff near Osceola - but not before getting help from an unsuspecting state trooper after he ran out of gas 50 miles west of Camdenton .

Kyles told the trooper he was headed home after a fight with his wife. The trooper directed police to Kyles after he subsequently heard a statewide alert for the wanted man.
