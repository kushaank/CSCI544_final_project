
If youâ€™ve gone downtown along West End Avenue, chances are youâ€™ve seen construction for Renasant Bankâ€™s new Tennessee headquarters next to the Hutton Hotel.

While the new headquarters is due to open this fall, Rick Hart , Renasantâ€™s Tennessee president, told me Monday that the bank has more in store in the Nashville area.

For starters, he said, the 25,000-square-foot property is slated to include room for a new wealth-management group for the bank.

He added that the bankâ€™s Tennessee operations have been driving much of its loan growth, estimating that around 40 percent of the Tupelo, Miss.-based bankâ€™s lending is coming from Tennessee.

Growth in Tennessee means Renasant is pursuing future buys in the Nashville market, Hart said. Renasant first entered the Nashville market in 2007, when it acquired Hartâ€™s Capital Bank & Trust.

Last year, Renasant acquired First M&F Corp., another Mississippi lender, in a stock transaction totaling $115.2 million, expanding the bankâ€™s presence in the Memphis and Birmingham markets. Renasant had around $5.9 billion in assets at the end of the first quarter 2014.

â€œWe have a great capital base and are poised to take advantage of that if there are opportunities out there,â€� Hart said of deals in the Tennessee market.

According to Nashville Business Journal research, Renasant is the 22nd largest bank in the Nashville MSA by deposit share, with $315 million in local deposits as of Dec. 31, 2013.
