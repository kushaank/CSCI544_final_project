
Police say a woman went on a vehicular rampage Sunday, steering her car toward multiple people, including two children, before driving into the front of a South Dallas home.

Gabrielle Jackson, 24, was arrested on four counts of aggravated assault. She remains in the Dallas County Jail in lieu of $200,000 bail.

According to an arrest warrant affidavit, Jackson told a witness that she was headed to one of the victim’s homes on Sonny Circle shortly before 11:30 a.m. Sunday. A family member of the victims told KXAS-TV (NBC5) that Jackson was upset because the mother of the children was dating her ex-boyfriend.

The man tried to stop Jackson, police say, but she ignored him and continued driving toward the home. Jackson then intentionally drove her 2002 Chevrolet Impala into the victim’s vehicle, the records say.

Jackson then pursued an 11-year-old pedestrian walking on the right side of the road, hitting the child’s arm and slamming into a chain link fence, police said. She proceeded to pursue a 6-year-old pedestrian, police said, and crashed into another chain link fence while chasing the child up the road to the porch of the home.

When a second witness exited the home, Jackson reversed her vehicle and turned toward the house before ramming into it, causing substantial damage, police said. The witness threw a cinderblock windshield of the car in defense.

Jackson backed the car out into the street and moved to the passenger side of the vehicle before police arrived. Officers separated all parties and arrested Jackson.
