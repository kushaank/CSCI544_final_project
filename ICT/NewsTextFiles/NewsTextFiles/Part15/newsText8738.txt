
Wearing gowns, suits and stylish accessories, Dedham High School students recently walked across the auditorium to receive long awaited trophies at the Media Film Festival and Scully Awards.

Dubbed after TV/video and film teacher Susan Scully-Rose, the festival sheds light on students� production projects.

In "Guitar Dream," for example, the audience gets VIP access into the inner mind of a despairing man who feels baffled after a woman rejects him.

The master behind the art is junior Gabe Straight, who scored a Scully for the video in the "Best Visual Poem" category.

"You go into his mind and he�s really confused as to why he�s heartbroken, why she didn�t accept his heart," Straight, 17, said May 7, as he proudly held the adorned trophy.

The ultimate goal, he said, was to shock the audience.

Scully-Rose launched the festival nine years ago as a way to showcase students� work and attract new faces into the program. But, it now serves as a driving force for kids.

"I started it as a way to show the work that my students do, and overtime it evolved into a huge motivator," Scully-Rose said May 7, minutes before the lights went out and the hosts took over the stage. "Kids get really excited about it."

Thirty judges, including 25 high school teachers and five professionals in the video and television industry, evaluated all submitted work. The videos screened at the ceremony underwent two rounds of judging.

"Judges say they love the variety of projects the kids do, that the videos get better every year, that they are impressed with what the kids are doing, that certain projects are great ideas, such as the Depiction of a Winter Poem and the Visual Poem," Scully-Rose said. "A lot of teachers don't really know what we do in our classes, so being a judge is a great opportunity to see what the students have been working on."

The entirely student-run festival showcased dozens of filmmakers, writers and producers.

Straight, who won awards for three of his four nominations, wrote the script, an anthology of jokes modeled after the Oscars.

The festival ended when host Lily Straight-Rattet nudged co-host Andrew Kiklis, who was silent. Receiving no response, Straight-Rattet told Kiklis to keep talking, but he simply said, "the line is blank." She saves the night by saying "it looks like our scriptwriter ran out of jokes."

Straight-Rattet, 18, was nominated in the "Best Visual Poem" category for her short video of a glitch during a regular school day.

"It�s me going through a day at school, but I have a glitch. My body disappears and then appears again," she said, wearing a black gown and bright red lipstick.

Although she left empty-handed, she has collected four trophies since her sophomore year.

Page 2 of 2 - Kiklis, 18, was nominated for "Best Off-Camera Interview" and "Best Public Service Announcement."

He said if he had to choose, he�d rather win the latter.

"The lunch room wanted us to do something on healthy foods," he explained, adding that his video depicts a teenager that is tired because of eating unhealthy foods.

In the video, Kiklis tells the boy to eat healthy snacks, which give him an energy boost, and he ends up doing flips.

Freshman Liseimy Mateo was not nominated, but she went to the ceremony to support her classmates.

"I thought it was going to be boring, but it�s actually really fun," the 15-year-old said. "My favorite is the mock commercials because they�re really funny."

For parents, the festival was an opportunity to check out students� creative work.

Carol McCarthy, whose daughter was nominated for an award, said the event was "fantastic."

"This is like the Oscars," she said, adding that the Dedham community pitched in through donations.

The media department raised about $1,200 to buy new equipment, memory cards, DVDs, props that are used in videos, and supplies for the TV studio, according to Scully-Rose.
