
Gov. Jay Inslee spoke about his vision that Washington state become a center of green energy companies, at the Climate Solutions breakfast Monday.

We had a chance Monday to briefly speak with Gov. Jay Inslee after he spoke at the sixth annual Climate Solutions breakfast in Seattle.

About 900 people, many of them business leaders, packed the event at the Westin Hotel Grand Ballroom. Inslee was a key speaker, and he answered a few of my questions after the event.

About why Washington needs to move fast to support new â€œgreenâ€� industries:"Thereâ€™s a threat to the manufacturing base if we do not act to seize these economic opportunities. One of the things weâ€™ve learned is the first-mover has a huge advantage in any technological revolution. In software we know that, in software and carbon fiber we know that, and in clean energy we know that. The threat is in inaction rather than action. If we donâ€™t seize these first-mover opportunities, theyâ€™re going to go to Germany, theyâ€™re going to go to China. I want us to be the first movers and seize these markets.

About the carbon composite materials industry, and Washingtonâ€™s future role:"Pittsburgh had the steel industry, Washington can have the carbon fiber industry, because now we realize itâ€™s not just in aerospace; itâ€™s in cars. Imagine cars of the future that are predominantly carbon based, and not steel based, twice as strong, half the weight, and itâ€™s happening in Moses Lake."

About crude oil trains passing through Washington state:"We have a lot of concerns, we have safety issues we are not on top of. We are seriously behind the curve dealing with safety issues. When we have tanks transporting oil, on cars that were not designed for heavy volatiles, thatâ€™s a real problem."
