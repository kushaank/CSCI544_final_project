
LONDON, United Kingdom - An expose centred on the United States has detailed how children have been caught up in the tobacco industry.

The BBC has reported that North Carolina families who farm tobacco often employ children under the age of 16, many from South America, to farm their tobacco fields.

Human Rights Watch has called for reform of the practice, saying children, some as young as 12, have been put to work in the fields, starting between 4 to 5am, working near heavy machinery and dangerous tools.

The group has said that tobacco, grown across the vast coastal plains of North Carolina, is dusted with dangerous chemicals, which is now creating health problems.

Children, spoken to by the BBC, said they had fashioned trash bags, with holes for their arms and head, to keep chemicals off their clothing.

Some complained that after a day's work, they had felt their faces burning.

Many children were reported as suffering acute nicotine poisoning.

When nicotine is absorbed through their skin, the symptoms include nausea, vomiting, headaches and dizziness.

It has been reported the children work for around three months in the summer, harvesting tobacco.

They work up to 72 hours a week earning US$500-$600 per week.

When it comes to Iran's nuclear weapons program, the only difference between them is this: Ahmadinejad was a wolf in wolf's clothing, Rouhani is a wolf in sheep's clothing, a wolf who thinks he can pull the wool over the eyes of the international community.

The chief lobbyist for the National Retail Federation was speaking about talks to end the U.S. government shutdown.
