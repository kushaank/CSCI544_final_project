
Ravitch is a tough prosecutor with a track record of making good choices in difficult cases. She has spent much of her first term rebuilding an office that lost about a dozen lawyers, investigators and support personnel to budget cuts. With the office returning to pre-recession staffing, she's positioned to manage a challenging caseload.

Sundstrom has a record of caution and prudence as the county's chief financial officer. Having previoulsy helped Orange County recover from bankruptcy, he brings crisis experience shared by few of his peers.

Rabbitt has proven to be a calm and steady leader, particularly in providing guidance and clear thinking in the areas such as clean power and pensions. He also has been a leader in helping the county find more money for road repair.

No other candidate can match Churchill's knowledge of the county's financial challenges, particularly as they relate to pensions and potholes. In addition to offering a background in financial management, he comes with hands-on experience in alternative energy and environmental protection.

Huffman was instrumental in the expansion the California Coast National Monument.

Thompson secured a long-sought change in Medicare policy that benefits physicians and senior citizens in Sonoma County.

McGuire is well informed, hardworking and, at age 34, unusually experienced with a resum?that includes service on the school board and City Council in Healdsburg and, since 2011, representing northern Sonoma County on the Board of Supervisors.

As the former executive director of Santa Rosa-based Burbank Housing Corp., Lowry has an unmatched understanding of the issues surrounding housing, development and planning in California. In addition, his practical expertise would be of particular value in helping governments bridge the funding gap left by the abolition of redevelopment agencies, a void that has limited the ability of public agencies to address housing and infrastructure needs.

During his 18 months in office, Levine has generally reflected his affluent, left-leaning district. He's also a product of the top-two primary, an important election reform that took effect in 2012, giving moderate and independent voters a bigger say in California elections, which should encourage cross-the-aisle cooperation on state issues.

California is home to a quarter of the country's homeless veterans. Sonoma County, where rental rates are high and vacancy rates are low, has about 400 homeless vets. Proposition 41 would authorize the state to borrow $600 million to subsidize construction, acquisition and renovation of apartments and other multifamily housing units for these vets.

Without timely access to government documents, the state Public Records Act is meaningless. Its purpose and effectiveness hinge on the ability of members of the public and the media being able to obtain and review documents when the issue is relevant, not when compliance is convenient. There have been too many examples of public agencies attempting to hide behind exemptions to the state's transparency laws to protect themselves from embarrassment or criminal misconduct. Openness should not be an option.
