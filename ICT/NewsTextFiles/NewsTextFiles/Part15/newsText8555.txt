
Researchers are tracking a great white shark that has traveled nearly 4,000 miles to South Florida waters after she was tagged in Massachusetts.

The shark, named "Katharine" by nonprofit shark research group OCEARCH, was last tracked by satellite Sunday at 11:05 a.m. in waters just east of Biscayne National Park.

OCEARCH has been following Katharine since August 19, when she was tagged in Cape Cod, Mass.

Katharine the shark also has a Twitter feed , where comical posts can be found, such as, "I like spots where no one bugs me," and, "You know I'm not the only one here, right?"
