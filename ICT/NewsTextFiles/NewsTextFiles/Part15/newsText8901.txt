
CEDAR RAPIDS – Mariannette Miller-Meeks has more than doubled her support in the race for the Republican nomination in Iowa’s 2nd District.

Miller-Meeks, who has twice unsuccessfully challenged U.S. Rep. Dave Loebsack, is seeking the party’s nomination for a third attempt to unseat the four-term Iowa City Democrat.

A Loras College Poll released Monday showed a strong lead for the Ottumwa ophthalmologist and former director of the Iowa Department of Public Health. In an early April Loras College poll, she led 17 percent to 11 percent over Rep. Mark Lofgren, Muscatine.

The more recent poll showed that Lofgren’s number hasn’t changed much. He now has the support of 12.3 percent of Republicans likely to vote in the June 3 primary election.

Given that 50 percent of those surveyed were still undecided, Associate Professor of Politics and Director of the Loras College poll, Christopher Budzisz said she has work to do to secure the nomination.

He noted that although Miller-Meeks is a familiar name to Republican voters, she only announced her candidacy in February. Lofgren, on the other hand, has been running since June 2013.

Although the national political climate may benefit the GOP nominee in the 2nd, “incumbency advantage is a hard thing to overcome in any election cycle,” Budzisz said.

The telephone poll of 300 likely GOP primary voters May 13-14 found that 35.6 percent favored Miller-Meeks, 12.3 percent backed Lofgren and 50.7 percent were undecided.

The poll has a 5.65 percent margin of error.
