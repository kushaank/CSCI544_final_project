
A 14-year-old girl who said she was abducted Sunday afternoon is now facing charges.

The Lee County Sheriff's Office said the girl claimed a group of men grabbed her and forced her into a white van, before dumping her at an empty apartment.

On Monday, authorities said the girl made up the story.

"The facts were that she had engaged in a conversation with him via social [media] and later by text and phone. This had gone on for a couple of days and then she agreed to meet with him," said Lt. Larry King.

King said 27-year-old Edward Martinez picked up the teen near her house off Gary Drive and Billy's Creek Drive .

They were found at his apartment off Alderman Street, just three miles away. Deputies say both were disoriented. Drugs and alcohol were found inside the apartment.

King said the teenager, whose name has not been released because of her age, texted her sister and said she had been abducted.

Neighbor Alvin Bishop said he saw deputies at the teen's house.

"What is she doing?! Where's the parent? That's what I wonder," said Bishop.

The girl's mother spoke with us off-camera. She said her daughter is innocent. She claimed her child was lured to Martinez's home - but neighbors aren't buying it.

"It's uncalled for," said Bishop. "I think the little girl needs a lesson taught to her. She needs to be dealt with in a major way."

The teen is charged with giving false information to an officer. Martinez is also facing several drug charges. He appeared before a Lee County judge Monday morning. He's being held on a $52,500 bond.
