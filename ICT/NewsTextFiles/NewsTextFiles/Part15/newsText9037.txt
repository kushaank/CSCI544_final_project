
LITCHFIELD PARK, Ariz. - Litchfield Park man was booked into jail on suspicion of several sexual assaults and sex with a teenage girl.

Albert Gibbons, 48, was arrested early Monday morning after a hysterical woman ran to a neighbor's house and called 911 about 11 p.m. Sunday to report she had been beaten.

Gibbons was tracked down by Maricopa County sheriff's deputies after he fled the scene, according to an MCSO news release.

The woman was examined at a hospital and later told deputies she suffered a pattern of beatings, sexual assaults and torture that began when Gibbons accused her of stealing money from him, according to the release.

She said the beatings became more violent and at times happened in public before escalating to sexual assaults, according to the release.

Gibbons was booked into the Fourth Avenue Jail on seven class 2 felonies, ranging from sexual conduct with a minor to sexual assault.
