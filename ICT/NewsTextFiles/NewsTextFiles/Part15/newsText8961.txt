
As part of President Obama's continuing commitment to help coastal communities recover from Hurricane Sandy and promote resilient coastal systems, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the State of New Hampshire signed a two-year cooperative agreement totaling US$200,000 to identify sand resources for coastal resilience and restoration planning.

The agreement will help BOEM and the State of New Hampshire conduct research that will assist coastal communities in recovering from future devastating storms such as Hurricane Sandy, restore habitat, increase knowledge of offshore sand resources, and contribute to long-term coastal planning efforts.

Under this agreement, the University of New Hampshire Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping, together with the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services and the New Hampshire Geological Survey, will develop an assessment of sand resource needs, and provide analysis of existing geophysical and geological data that can be used to find new sand resource areas offshore New Hampshire.

Partnering with the University of New Hampshire Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping allows BOEM to work with a leading center for ocean study that has a strong international reputation. The New Hampshire Geological Survey has partnered with BOEM on previous cooperative agreements since 2004. Together, these institutions bring a wealth of scientific expertise to the understanding of ocean resources for the state, region and nation.

The activities included in this cooperative agreement are essential for reducing potential storm damage to the residents, economies, and infrastructure of New Hampshire's coastal areas. Research funded under the agreement will help ensure that activities, including offshore dredging and beach nourishment, are conducted in a sustainable manner that is compatible with natural sediment transport and biological processes, as well as stakeholder interests.
