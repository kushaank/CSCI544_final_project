
After thousands of dead fish floated to the surface inside a dock at a Marina del Rey harbor, authorities are leaving it to Mother Nature to pick up the mess.

Heaps of sardines and anchovies washed up overnight Saturday, forming a carpet of carcasses among docks and boats in Basin A of the harbor, near Bora Bora Way.

Harbor officials estimated 50,000 to 70,000 fish floated to the surface, CBS Los Angeles reported. The head of a school of fish likely led the sea life into the harbor, where it dead ends, causing the group to suffocate, the station reported.

Reports of the dead fish started coming in about 11 p.m. Saturday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.

Sheriff’s officials called the Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors to the scene to clear the fish from the water and notified the state Department of Fish and Wildlife, according to a deputy at the Marina del Rey Station.

The incident is minor compared with the massive fish die-off in King Harbor in Redondo Beach three years ago, sheriff’s officials said.

The March 2011 fish kill was blamed on millions of small fish that swam into the marina en masse, used up all the available oxygen, suffocated and died.
