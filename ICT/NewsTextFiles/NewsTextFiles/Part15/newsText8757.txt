So once all of the seed is in the ground, what kind of summer weather will farmers endure? The new National Weather Service forecast is out and it indicates the possibility of a pretty good growing season for the Midwest.

He says part of the forecast is based on the development of an El Nino weather pattern but for the rest of the country the forecast is a little less optimistic.

In the areas there is also not a strong indicator yet about precipitation levels, but it could possibly be a bit dry along the western gulf coast.

Hoosier Ag Today was born out of a need to provide a voice for Indiana agriculture. As agriculture in the Hoosier state began to change and grow in the early 21st century, there was a void of information for and about the industry on the radio. Veteran farm broadcaster Gary Truitt had a desire to tell the story of the great economic promise and potential of Hoosier agriculture. In 2006, he founded Hoosier Ag Today, a series of programs that focuses on the news and issues for and about Indiana agriculture.
