
Communities across the Lower Arkansas River Basin are joining forces to find ways to manage high selenium levels in the Arkansas River.

All landowners in the Lower Arkansas River Basin are invited to attend a tour, dinner and meeting May 29 at the Arkansas Valley Research Center, east of Rocky Ford. The tour will be at 2 p.m., a free dinner is at 5:30 p.m. and the meeting is from 6 to 8 p.m.

The high selenium levels in the river threaten fish. Two state water quality leaders, Dick Parachini of Colorado and Tom Stiles of Kansas, will talk about current water quality and discuss why selenium management is needed.

Drs. Tim Gates and Ryan Bailey of Colorado State University will present findings from 10 years of selenium-related studies and recommend best management practices. Attendees then will be invited to discuss options and resources needed to implement the recommendations.

Meeting fliers are available at the local Conservation District and CSU Cooperative Extension offices.
