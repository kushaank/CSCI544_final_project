Hundreds of motorcyclists to stop in Tuscaloosa Tuesday en route to Memorial Day in D.C.

TUSCALOOSA, Alabama -- Hundreds of travelers on motorcycles will stop at the VA Medical Center in Tuscaloosa Tuesday to spend time with veterans and rest for a short time before saddling back up and heading toward Washington D.C. to observe Memorial Day next week.

The riders are expected to arrive between 10 and 11 a.m., at which point supportive citizens, veterans and the staff of the clinic will line the route to the medical center and welcome the men and women to Tuscaloosa.
