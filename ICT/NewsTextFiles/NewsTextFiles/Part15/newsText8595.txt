
ROGERS, Ark. (AP) — A spokesman for John Boozman says the U.S. senator is eager to return to work following surgery to repair an aorta tear, but it may take several more weeks before he is fully recovered.

The 63-year-old Republican from Rogers underwent emergency heart surgery April 22 after being rushed to the emergency room and diagnosed with an acute aortic dissection.

Boozman spokesman Patrick Creamer says the senator was released from the hospital within a week and has been recuperating at home.
