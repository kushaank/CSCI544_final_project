
Sean Baptiste is wounded warrior in Jackson County that many may remember. He's a veteran who suffered injuries in Iraq, including a broken spine.

Sunday afternoon, dozens of supporters came out for an all you can eat crawfish boil and barbeque party all in efforts to raise money to help the vet with home repairs.

One particular man by the name of Troy Rogers said he doesn't take for granted the men and women who sacrifice their lives to protect his country.

"You know, I've been blessed in my life. And I look around and the only reason that we're able to do what we're doing is because it's these military men that make these sacrifices for us," Rogers said.

Rogers is also the man behind the construction and repairs to the home of Baptiste. He said he immediately felt the need to lend a hand after seeing the veterans story on WLOX News last month.

"This man he went there and got hurt real bad and he's living in this house and I have to help him. And I'm out here today and I'm just fortunate enough to have met him to where I can do this," he said.

To Baptiste, knowing there are people in his own community that care, lets him know the fight for his country didn't go in vain.

Rogers said he'll continue supporting events like this at Fat Boy's until they can help out other wounded vets in the community, and eventually around the world.
