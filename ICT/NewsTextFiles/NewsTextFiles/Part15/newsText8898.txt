
Legislators in an Illinois House committee passed Speaker Michael Madigan's (D-Chicago) plan to place a non-binding referendum on the November ballot concerning a boost to the state's minimum wage. The proposal was passed Friday by a 12-7 vote, with no Republicans voting in favor of the referendum.

Brown  told the Chicago Sun-Times  that the full House could take up the legislation as early as next week. The current legislative session ends May 31.
