
Work continues at the development Walnut Grove, where attention to detail is not being overlooked. As KPLC's Lee Peck reports it's combining the old with the new for a one of kind community in the Lake Area.

 A bicyclist was rushed to a Lake Charles hospital Monday night after colliding with a car on Highway 14 near Hillcrest Drive.

An 18-year-old Lake Charles man has been arrested on a charge of simple robbery, city police said.

Deputy Chief Mark Kraus said Deontez Damal Davis was arrested last week in connection with an incident on May 3.

Kraus said Davis took an iPad from a woman while she was walking near Huber Park.

"Davis robbed the victim of the iPad and sold it at a local game store," Kraus said Monday in a news release. "Records and video surveillance from the store led to the identification of the suspect."

Bond was set at $150,000.
