
A state panel in Nevada has opted to not name a Lake Tahoe cove for Mark Twain, saying the author was racist against Native Americans.

The request to rename a cove on the lake’s northeast shore for Samuel Clemens—Twain was a pen name—has been indefinitely tabled by the Nevada State Board on Geographic Names.

Cruz, is head of the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California’s cultural resource department, also said Twain doesn’t deserve the honor because he was against naming the lake Tahoe, a word derived from Washoe word “da ow” for lake.

The term “digger” is derogatory and refers to western tribes who dug roots for food.

Thomas Quirk, an English professor emeritus at the University of Missouri and leading Twain scholar, told the Associated Press that Twain did get over his racism toward blacks but Quirk hasn’t found any evidence that the author’s views on Native Americans ever changed.

Quirk told the Associated Press that Twain did not embrace idolizing who he called the “noble red man,” which was Twain’s way of picking on James Fenimore Cooper.

Robert Stewart, a member of the Nevada State Board on Geographic Names, actually dropped his support of the renaming even though he initiated it.

Kudos to Mr. Robert Stewart!  Too bad more people aren't as sensitive to Native issues like this.    Sad news about Twain - I'm not surprised though, one of my favorite American writers, Edgar Allen Poe was a confirmed racist.  He actually believed that the Black man was inferior to the White man.  I don't know how he felt about Indians, but if you can hate one group of people for the color of their skin, it's not that hard to hate a different group for the same thing.

Grasshopper soup? Well, if it's half as tasty as fried grasshoppers with an ice-cold beer, Twain wasn't just a discriminatory jerk, he was also a fool -- that stuff's delicious!
