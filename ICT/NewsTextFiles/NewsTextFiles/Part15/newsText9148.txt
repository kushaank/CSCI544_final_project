
Lt. Chris De Back told WLOX TV that police responded to an apartment complex Saturday where officers found a woman in need of medical treatment. Authorities said the woman claimed she had been choked by Devin Michael Thomas. De Back said Thomas had fled the scene before police arrived.

He said police were called to the same apartments on Sunday after witnesses said they saw Thomas allegedly breaking into the female victim's apartment. Officials said Thomas was arrested on scene without incident.

De Back said Thomas was held at the Harrison County Adult detention center on a $100,000 bond.
