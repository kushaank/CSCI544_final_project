
Candidates are criss-crossing the state to get votes.

Jack Kingston is running for the Republican bid for the open U-S Senate seat, which will be left vacant by the retirement of Saxby Chambliss.

He stopped at Daniel Field on Monday.

Kingston is one of 7 Republican candidates, and he says it's important to get his message out until the last minute.

"This is a seven way multi candidate shoot out," Kingston says. "So a couple votes here or there can make  a real big difference in terms of someone getting into a runoff, and we do not want to leave anything on the table. I've been to the Columbia, Richmond County area many many times, we don't want to give up any territory so we just wanted to come back and push the message one more time."

Kingston is currently a congressman from the Savannah area.  He headed back to Washington on Monday for Tuesday's House vote on a dredging bill for the Savannah River.
