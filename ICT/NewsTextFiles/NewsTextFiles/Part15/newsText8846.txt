
LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- A third case of MERS has been confirmed in the U.S., but unlike the first two cases, health officials say this one was transmitted on U.S. soil through a meeting and a handshake.

Officials say the latest patient is an Illinois man who had a business meeting with the Indiana patient before they tested positive for MERS.

Another case was reported in Florida.

The CDC now wants to test people who came in contact with the Illinois man, because even with no symptoms, it's possible he could have spread the deadly virus.
