
Mother Nature put on an awesome display of power in Wyoming Sunday with a supercell thunderstorm. Lucky for us, pro stormchasers caught it on film.

Looking like something straight out of a Hollywood movie, dark clouds gathered swiftly in a large swirl over a rural section of Wyoming near Newcastle on Sunday evening, forming a rare weather phenomenon called a supercell. It's the most dangerous of all thunderstorms, marked by an ominous-looking vortex of air that can quickly turn into a tornado.

It starts getting really nuts around the :55-second mark.
