
The Twyford Inn could be lost to Tiverton following a devastating fire.

The walls of the burnt-out pub on the corner of Bampton Street and Newport Street are to be demolished once the property has been assessed by insurers.

A report read at the annual town council meeting revealed that the pub’s unsafe remains would probably be pushed inwards because of the risk that the building poses to public safety.

The area around the Twyford  remains cordoned off following the fire on April 14, with no pedestrian or vehicle access allowed in the area immediately outside the building.

Mr Vanderwolfe said that building officers were concerned about the possibility of the building collapsing into the road, and that, once insurers had finished their assessments, the walls of the pub would be pushed inwards.

Town councillors raised concerns at the meeting about traffic confusion in the area after just half of the road in Bampton Street next to the Twyford was closed following the fire.

Castle Ward Cllr Jeff Rawlings said that signs put in place were unclear to drivers.

A police officer who was atttended the meeting confirmed that Bampton Street was shut to traffic travelling from the pub in the direction of People’s Park but remained open to traffic travelling towards the town.

An update on the pub’s future was released by Mid Devon District Council following the annual council meeting, reiterating the dangerous nature of the building.

It also said that Enterprise Inns, the owners of the Twyford, was arranging for ‘necessary work’ to be carried out.

The authority said: “We have advised the owner that if the building is to be demolished, they need to provide us with a demolition notice for building control.

“Although the building is in a conservation area, demolition works to secure safety may take place without planning permission.
