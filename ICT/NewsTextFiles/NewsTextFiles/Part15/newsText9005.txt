
HANOVER â€” Volunteers at an exotic animal rescue in southern Pennsylvania are still looking for a monkey that got loose and ran away during a fire that destroyed the facility.

The East Coast Exotic Animal Rescue in Adams County burned down early Saturday. Two residents escaped, and most of the animals were saved from the fire. Two cats died.

A capuchin monkey named Bug escaped from his carrier during the rescue and ran into the woods. He remained missing on Sunday. Volunteer Melissa Bishop tells pennlive.com, "He's special to us, and finding him is our number one priority."

Fairfield Fire Chief Adam Jacobs says the fire was likely caused by a wireless router that shorted out and ignited some papers.
