
COIMBATORE:  Twelve people, including an Armed Reserve personnel, were booked for allegedly grabbing land  of retired Superintendent of Police worth `1 crore.

According to police P Ramasamy, a retired SP owns 17 cents worth `1.02 crore at Uppilipalayam in the names of his two sons. The land, bought by Ramasamy’s mother-in-law in 1988, was partitioned in 1990 between her grandsons  Gopalakrishnan and Saravanan but registered in their pet names.

In 2008 Ramasamy wanted to sell the land and handed over a copy of the document to AR head constable Rajendran. Rajendran set up a duo from Chennai to impersonate Gopalakrishnan and Saravanan. He then forged a power of attorney in the name of his wife Amsaveni. When the SP learnt of this in 2009, he cancelled the power of attorney.

Rajendran again conspired with his wife and 3 brokers Lakshmann from Chennai, and Chandran and Karuppasamy from Kovai. He forged a power of attorney in the name of Ramraj of Kovai in February last year. Using this he sold the property to one Bhuvan Sundar in April last year.  The disputed sale deed was prepared by advocate Mohamed Anees.

“Since the initial purchase was not made in official names of Ramasamy’s sons, we cannot arrest the accused. Only after arresting the Chennai duo we can proceed in the case,” police said.
