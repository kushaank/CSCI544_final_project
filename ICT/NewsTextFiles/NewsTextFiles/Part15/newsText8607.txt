
Beware today's Google Doodle. It could be a major time suck.

In celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Rubik's Cube, Google has created a working online version of the puzzle – and will auto-count the number of moves to completion (bottom left). The current world record: 20 moves.

The other category of Rubik's Cube-solvers is all about the Fewest Moves, which is less about speed and more about precision. (In fact, speedcubers actually use about twice as many moves as the fewest movers). The reigning Fewest Moves Challenge Champion is Tomoaki Okayama. In July of 2012 at the Czech Open, the Japanese whiz solved the puzzle in 20 moves, according to the World Cube Association. Watch the solution in slow motion on YouTube. Just four years earlier, The Christian Science Monitor was lauding the efforts of Stanford-trained mathematician Tomas Rokicki for using his PC to solve the puzzle in 25 moves (and those calculations took 1,500 hours).

If you think the Google Doodle is cool, you might be a candidate for the "Beyond Rubik's Cube" exhibit at the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City, N.J. Not only can you get a peek at one of the original Rubik models, you can play the 26-foot high Groovik's Cube. This puzzle was created for the 2009 Burning Man Festival in Nevada by Mike Tyka and GroovLabs, a Seattle-based art collective. Rather than mechanically twisting, Groovik's Cube uses shifting and changing LED lights to mimic the motion of Rubik’s Cube.

If you don't want to travel to New Jersey, you can also play an online version.
