
On Monday, one could hear the echoing of military songs being sung though the Kansas Union for the University of Kansas Army ROTC Spring Commissioning ceremony.

It was an especially big deal for 2nd Lt. Madeline Wilcox. She's the first female field artillery officer to be commissioned as an officer in to a combat arms branch.

"I feel like it's even more exciting than graduating from college. I feel like this I kind of the bigger deal," Wilcox said.

Although she started her journey in the ROTC program four years ago, at the time women weren't allowed to be combat officers. However, in 2013, the Pentagon lifted the ban on women in combat.

"Women are just starting to be put back in. It's a responsibility, I think, and I just really want to be the positive example of why they're putting women in there," Wilcox said.

But according to her superiors, it wasn't an honor just given.

"She's a good leader. You have to be a good leader, you have to be physically fit, you have to be able to say follow me and lead," Reynolds said. "She has all those qualities."

Wilcox, a Leavenworth native, who grew up with both her father and brother in the military, couldn't be more proud to carry on this family tradition.

"You never want to say I want my kids to do everything I did, but it's always nice to see one of them follow in your footstep," Retired Lt. Col. Mark Wilcox, Madeline's father said.
