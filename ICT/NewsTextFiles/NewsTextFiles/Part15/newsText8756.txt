
Day 3: Disneyland & California Park. It was frantic the first day here, huge crowd. It was a bit difficult to get to anything. We started at Disneyland and did a few of the 'classic' rides: the carousel, the tea cups, Tarzan's tree house.....all pretty tame! Headed to California Park and did the California Soaring ride (simulated flight the boy said)....oh my bloody god! It was like hang gliding, you hung free and soared over mountains and dipped into valleys.....so realistic, Rick loved this ride.....I was petrified the whole time and scared past panic, could not convince myself it wasn't real. Rick went on the Screaming Roller coaster next....my feet were staying on the ground for the rest of the day.

Day 4: Second day at Disneyland & California Park. Less crowds today, so more changes to go on rides and see shows. The highlights were: Toy story ride (interactive game/ride) - pretty cool, the Cars Land tractors....cute & fun, the muppets show (3D show) - really funny, Rick did the Goofy roller coaster & Scream Mountain.....but both our favourite ride was Indiana Jones and the Temple of doom......brilliant ride! Did other rides and shows....full day, then finished off in Toon Town. Great Day.

I'll never forget queuing up for the cups ride.  If I ever hear "its a small world after all" I will die!

How the staff stand it I have no idea.
