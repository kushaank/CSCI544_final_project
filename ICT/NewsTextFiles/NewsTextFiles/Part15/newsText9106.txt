BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem says the Devils Lake City Commission violated the state's open meetings laws when a committee met without notice and failed to follow proper procedures during executive session.

The committee was made up of eight people, including two commissioners. It met on March 5 to discuss various issues, including submitted relocation expenses and lawsuits involving the city's condemnation proceedings.

The commission argued that the committee was not subject to open meetings laws because a quorum of the commission was not present and the group was not delegated to perform any function on behalf of the council.

Stenehjem says the city commission must remedy the violation by posting a notice of the March 5 meeting and creating detailed minutes to address public business that was discussed.
