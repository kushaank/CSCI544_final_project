
Willie Nelson and Family & Alison Krauss and Union Station Featuring Jerry Douglas kicked off the concert season at The Woods Amphitheater at Fontanel on Friday, May 16th in Nashville, TN.  Even though there was a chill in the air, concert goers came in droves to see the music legends share the stage together for an unforgettable show. Willie Nelson and Alison Krauss & Union Station Featuring Jerry Douglas are touring together throughout the spring and summer.

Opening the show was The Devil Makes Three , whose travels and travails serve as inspiration for their fourth album and their New West Records debut, I’m a Stranger Here, produced by Buddy Miller and recorded at Dan Auerbach’s (Black Keys) Easy Eye Sound Studio in Nashville. Laced with elements of ragtime, country, folk and rockabilly, the critically praised trio was a crowd pleaser.

Next, Alison Krauss , who effortlessly bridges the gap between roots music and country, rock and pop, took the stage for a stunning performance with Union Station – Jerry Douglas, Dan Tyminski , Ron Block and Barry Bales.

And finally, music legend Willie Nelson and Family performed numerous hits from his 200 plus albums and had the audience singing along.  Overall, the evening was a successful opener of what looks to be an outstanding concert lineup at The Woods at Fontanel.
