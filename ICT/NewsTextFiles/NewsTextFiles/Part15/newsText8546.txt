
A woman accused of killing her daughter-in-law is heading to court.

The Tama County Clerk of Court's office says if the selected early Tuesday, then opening statements could start later in the day.

Ginger Jefferson is charged with first degree murder, accused of killing her 32-year-old daughter in law, Kerry O'Clair-Jefferson back in September. An officer found Kerry's body in a Tama home while responding for a different reason. They say she suffered "sharp force injuries" to her neck and believe the killing was deliberate.

If convicted, Jefferson faces life in prison without a chance for parole.
