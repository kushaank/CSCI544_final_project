
Two women are facing charges of child endangerment after allegedly leaving children in a motel room.

It happened May 15 at the Capital Inn at 4601 Yellowstone Boulevard in southeast Houston.

Court records say at about 1:30 a.m. a hotel resident woke up to a knock on her door and found an unsupervised 2-year-old girl who was crying and shivering. The woman called the front desk and placed the child in a warm room while waiting for the parents to return.

Two hours later, the parents had still not returned to the motel and Houston police and Child Protective Services were called, according to court documents.

Investigators say 40 minutes later two women made it back to the Capital Inn and were arrested. The women told authorities they left their children unsupervised to find money to pay for the room and got lost on the way back.

A 6-year-old boy and 8-year-old boy were found in another room, according to authorities. Police are unsure of which woman is the guardian of which children.

Tierra Monique Pierce, 28, has been charged with abandon/endangering a child with intent to return. She is being held in the Harris County jail on $2,000 bond.

Harris County Jail and her bail is set at $15,000.
