
California Chrome will be permitted to wear a nasal strip in the Belmont Stakes on June 7.

The Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner has worn a strip, which is similar to those worn by athletes to assist with breathing, in his wins in California, Kentucky and Maryland—but rules in New York didn’t allowed for its use, without permission from racing stewards.

Monday, stewards at Belmont Park unanimously agreed to allow the use of equine nasal strips for all horses running at New York Racing Association racetracks. The rule becomes effective immediately.

After California Chrome’s trainer Art Sherman contacted stewards on Sunday afternoon to request permission for his horse to use nasal strips, analysis was sought from New York State Gaming Commission equine medical director Scott E. Palmer.

The stewards considered Dr. Palmer’s advice and determined to allow the unregulated use of the nasal strips.

California Chrome is expected to leave Baltimore’s Pimlico Race Course on Tuesday morning to head up to Belmont Park. He’ll be aiming to be the first horse since Affirmed in 1978 to win racing’s Triple Crown.

Secretariat, the last real champion.  GE and Rollerball anyone? Pathetic.

With Horse Racing down and in need of a triple-crown winner, it would have been surprising if Belmont said no.
