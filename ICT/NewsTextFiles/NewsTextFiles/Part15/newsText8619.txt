
California Chrome has worn nasal strips during victories in the first two events of thoroughbred racing's Triple Crown, but he might have to compete at the Belmont Stakes without one, if he competes at all.

California Chrome, winner of this year's Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, has been approved to wear his nasal strip and will compete in the Belmont Stakes, according to a post on the horse’s official Facebook page.

Belmont Park stewards officially approved the horse to wear the nasal strip on Monday morning, according to the Facebook post.

A statement from the New York Racing Association and the state's Gaming Commission says three stewards unanimously gave approval.

There were questions about whether the horse would compete in the Belmont Stakes because racing officials in New York don't allow nasal strips for horse racing.

California Chrome wore a nasal strip during his winning runs at the Kentucky Derby and Saturday's Preakness Stakes.

The colt will attempt to become the first horse since Affirmed in 1978 to win horse racing’s coveted Triple Crown in the June 7 Belmont Stakes in New York.

Only 11 horses have gone on to win the Belmont Stakes after winning the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes.

California Chrome is co-owned by Perry Martin of Yuba City.
