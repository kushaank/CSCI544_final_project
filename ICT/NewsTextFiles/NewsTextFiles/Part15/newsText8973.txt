
Jim Butler Chevrolet signed an agreement Friday to purchase four acres down the road from its dealership, which it plans to use for a $2 million expansion of its service center.

The dealership is under contract to purchase the property, at 1140 Gravois Road in Fenton, from Hillsboro-based N. McClain Investment Inc. The $2 million figure includes property acquisition and building costs, according to Brad Sowers , the owner of Jim Butler Chevrolet. The property was marketed at a price of $849,500.

Construction is expected to begin in four months, and the service center is expected to open about a year from now, Sowers said. He also plans to hire 40 employees this year across the Jim Butler Automotive Group, which includes a Kia store in Chesterfield Valley, a used vehicle sales facility in Crestwood and a body shop in south St. Louis County.

Business has been increasing at the Chevy dealershipâ€™s service department, which is open until 8 p.m. on weeknights for customer drop offs, Sowers said. Technicians work on the cars from 7 a.m. until midnight six days a week. They currently service about 80 vehicles a day.

â€œThe goal is to almost double that to 140 a day,â€� Sowers said.

The plan for the expansion has been in the works for about a year. Two years ago, Sowers added three acres for vehicle storage to the existing location at 759 Gravois Bluffs Blvd. in Fenton.

The Jim Butler groupâ€™s 2013 revenue was $166.7 million, up 15 percent from 2012, Sowers said. The groupâ€™s Chevrolet store sold 1,777 new vehicles and 1,336 used vehicles in 2013, up 16 percent from 2012. Its Kia dealership sold 1,169 new vehicles and 1,024 used vehicles in 2013, up 5 percent from 2012, according to the Missouri Department of Revenue.

Sowers, Jim Butler 's son-in-law, bought into the business 10 years ago and is the group's president and managing member.
