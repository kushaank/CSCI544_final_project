
Here of the SR's endorsements for governor, lieutenant governor and controller: Gov. Butch Otter says he’s seen as the enemy by people with whom he agrees on most issues. Governing brings out the pragmatist in politicians, and Otter has wisely chosen to pursue achievable goals, such as improving education and calling for transportation funding. His opponent, Senate Majority Caucus Chairman Russ Fulcher, wants to revisit old issues, such as Idaho Core Standards for schools (which he voted for) and dumping the state’s very successful insurance exchange, which is cheaper than the federal one that would replace it. His plan to boost the economy is gaining more control of federal lands. That’s not a plan. Otter is the clear choice/Spokesman-Review Editorial Board. More here.

Also: In Legislative District 3, we support businessman Patrick Whalen against incumbent Sen. Bob Nonini, who has focused more on party infighting than getting things done in Boise, where he has alienated the party leadership, including Otter.
