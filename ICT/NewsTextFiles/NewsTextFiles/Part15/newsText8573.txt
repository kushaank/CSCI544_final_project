MARYVILLE, Mo. (AP) - A northwest Missouri school principal with a knack for getting children to read has done it again, this time with a stunt involving an earthworm.

The Maryville Daily Forum reports that Susan Martin promised her kindergarten through fourth-grade students at St. Gregory's School a reward for each 10,000 minutes they spent reading on their own time this year. The children ran up 168,000 minutes, and on Friday it was time for Martin to make good on her pledge.
