
Mark Twain Naming Honour Scrapped For 'Racism'

A plan to name a Lake Tahoe cove after the literary giant is scrapped as a tribe says he was racist towards Native Americans.

A Native American tribe has scuppered a plan to name a cove on Lake Tahoe after Mark Twain, saying the celebrated American author held racist views.

The scenic cove on the lake's northeast shore was to be called Samuel Clemens, Twain's birth name.

But the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California, whose ancestral homeland includes Lake Tahoe, said Twain does not deserve the honour.

"Samuel Clemens had racist views on the native people of this country and has captured those views in his literature," Darrel Cruz, head of the tribe's cultural resource department, said in a letter.

"Therefore, we cannot support the notion of giving a place name in Lake Tahoe to Samuel Clemens."

Mr Cruz cited among other things the fact that Twain referred to the Washoe as "the digger tribe"  - a derogatory term applied to some tribes in the West who dug roots for food.

The Nevada State Board on Geographic Names this week voted to indefinitely table the request after hearing opposition from the tribe.

Supporters of the bid said the cove should be named for Twain because he praised Tahoe's beauty while visiting the lake in 1861-1862.

It is the second time that the bid to name the cove for Twain has failed.
