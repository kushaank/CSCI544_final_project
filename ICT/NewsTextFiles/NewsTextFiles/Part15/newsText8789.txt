
The GI Film Festival is bringing its army of thought-provoking films to the forefront this week, beginning with a sold-out world premiere in neighboring Old Town Alexandria and VIP screening Tuesday in Congress.

Veteran turned Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, New York Republican Rep. Chris Gibson and West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin III are all slated to attend the invite-only reception and premiere of “The Civilian-Military Divide” on Tuesday.

The film, directed by Sean McNamara, explores the burgeoning disconnect between the modern military and the general public.

“The mission of GI Film is to relay the messages of what the military truly does for our country, including sacrifices made; its goal is to bridge the gap between civilians and military members,” festival spokeswoman Heather Mahoney said of the group’s eight-plus year mission.

The action gets underway a day earlier for those across the river.

GIFF actually kicks off with the world premiere of “Field of Lost Shoes;” the project, directed by Sean McNamara, explores the trying times faced by a band of untested Virginia Military Institute cadets facing a date with destiny at the Battle of New Market.

Actor — and sometime director — David Arquette, told HOH reinterpreting history is practically the family business.

Sadly, our favorite night life impresario will not be visiting our neck of the woods this time around.

“I have no plans to go to Capitol Hill this trip. I’m just going to screen the film and hope the audience (and my grandfather somewhere) likes it,” Arquette suggested.

ITS NOT A SURPRISED THAT PEOPLE ARE BEGINING TO VOICE THEIR ANGER AT THE REPUBLICAN SENATE, AND AT SENATOR JOHN BOEHNER IN PARTICULAR, FOR THEIR TOTAL FAILURE TO DO THE “RIGHT & MORAL” THING, AND PASS THE UNEMPLOYMENT EXTENSION BILL FOR THESE 2.6 MILLION UNEMPLOYED FAMILIES WITHOUT BENEFITS. SINCE LATE LAST DECEMBER, THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN HOLDING THE EXTENSION BILL “HOSTAGE” IN THE SENATE FOR POLITICAL LEVERAGE. THEY HAVE MADE DELAY AFTER DELAY, DRAGGING THEIR FEET, WHILE FAMILLIES WERE BEING DESTROYED FINANCIALLY, MANY BECOMING HOMELESS IN THE PROCESS. THE REPUBLICANS HAVE USED THESE FAMILIES AS BARGAINING CHIPS, IN ORDER TO GET THE KOCH BROTHER’S OIL PIPE LINE APPROVED IN RETURN. THEY DON’T CARE ABOUT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN WORKER, THEY GIVE THEIR LOYALITY TO THE UPPER ONE PERCENT IN THE COUNTRY, NOT TO THE 99 PERCENT WHO DO MOST OF THE WORKING AND TAX PAYING. I’M SURPTEISED THAT PEOPLE HAVEN’T STARTED PROTESTING IN THE STREET ABOUT THIS. I KNOW THAT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE WASTED ONY CHANCE OF WINNING THE NEXT ELECTIONS BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE.

Don’t be fooled, folks: Obamacare isn’t about more choices and lower prices, it’s about fewer choices and higher prices.
