
One of the ex-prisoners who received a pardon from then-Gov. Haley Barbour has pleaded guilty to manslaughter after he killed another man in an exchange of gunfire.

Calhoun County District Attorney Ben Creekmore said Wayne Thurman Harris of Slate Springs made the plea Monday in Oxford before special Circuit Judge Breland Hilburn.

Harris had faced more severe charges of depraved heart murder in the 2013 death of Chris McGonagill of Calhoun City.

Creekmore said Harris was sentenced to five years in prison, followed by a 15-year suspended sentence. He also was sentenced to five years of post-supervision release.

Authorities said Harris and McGonagill argued at a cookout and both fired guns. Both were wounded, McGonagill fatally.

Harris was pardoned by Barbour in 2012 after serving a sentence for selling marijuana.
