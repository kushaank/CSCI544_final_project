
A few months ago, Paramore President Hannah Paramore got a phone call from an acquaintance at the Peabody Essex Museum, a client of the digital marketing agency, asking if she had an updated, "serious" CV available. He didn't say why, only that he was working on something special on her behalf.

A few weeks later, Paramore heard from Adam Bryant , the author of the The New York Times' Corner Office feature, who'd been contacted by Jay Finney, Paramore's friend at the Massachusetts museum. Soon after, Paramore travelled to New York City for a two-hour conversation that led to this weekend's Q&A in the Times .

Although Paramore didn't get the interview through her company's public relations agency, Reed Public Relations, she said the experience taught her the value of having a public relations strategy in place.

"This is sort of the big lesson to me about publicity â€¦ if we hadnâ€™t been ready for it when he started to research us, it wouldnâ€™t have happened,â€� Paramore said.

Thanks to the efforts of the Reed team, Paramore said, the agency had received lots of coverage on a local and regional scale and had the legitimacy Bryant was looking for when he began his research.
