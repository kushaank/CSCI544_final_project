
COLCHESTER Â— Almost all the members of the Vermont Army National Guard are headed to Louisiana for specialized training at Fort Polk.

The Vermont-based unit known formally as the 86th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (Mountain) is going to spend most of June at the Joint Readiness Training Center at the giant Louisiana base where the soldiers will train to fight against a mock opposing force.

Guard spokesman Maj. Chris Gookin said it will be the first time since the brigade was sent to Afghanistan in 2010 that the entire unit will train together.

But he said no overseas combat deployments are in store for the unit.
