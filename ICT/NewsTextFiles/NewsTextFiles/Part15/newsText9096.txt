
PHILADELPHIA -- A Philadelphia man running for a seat in the Pennsylvania House has a criminal record.

The Philadelphia Daily News reported that Dennis Kilderry, 38, pleaded guilty to four charges in an attempted auto theft in 1994. Bucks County District Attorney David Heckler said two of the charges appear to be felonies.

The Pennsylvania Constitution forbids felons from holding office.

Kilderry told the newspaper his public defender told him in 1994 that he was pleading guilty to misdemeanor charges. Kilderry said he made a mistake when he was a teenager but has moved on with his life.

Separately, Canadian officials issued two arrest warrants for Kilderry in 2011 stemming from charges in a hit-and-run car accident. Kilderry called it a "traffic summary violation" and said he paid a fine in 2012, ending the matter.

INDIANA -- Officials said three people died in a fire at a trailer home.

KDKA-TV reported that neighbors heard an explosion before the home in Indiana County caught fire around 3:30 a.m. Sunday.

Neighbors said they used axes and shovels to reach the home's occupants, but were forced to retreat due to smoke and flames.

KDKA said two adults and a child were killed.

There's no word on a cause. A state police fire marshal is investigating the blaze in White Township, about 65 miles east of Pittsburgh.

The names of the victims have not been released.

PHILADELPHIA -- Animal control officers said 17 dogs were seized from the cab of a tractor-trailer in Philadelphia.

WPVI-TV reported the animals were taken Saturday after police pulled the truck over because of a domestic dispute involving a man and woman inside.

Most of the dogs appear to be pit bulls.

No charges have been filed.
