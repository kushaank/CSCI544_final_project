
Haleigh Prosser received four awards in Fort Collins at the Colorado Science and Engineering Fair (State Science Fair) on April 10-12.

Prosser won a total of $680.00 combining all her achievements.

She won the Colorado State University College of Agricultural Sciences Innovations in Agriculture Award, Colorado Veterinary Medical Association and Auxiliary Award, Pioneer of Science for the Animal Science Division Award, and she placed third in the Junior Division of Animal Sciences.

This is Prosser's second year attending the state level competition after getting reserve champion junior project in the regional science fair.

On Thu., April 10, Prosser was judged on her project "Difference: Effects of Vitamin C in Cattle Fed Wet Distillers."

"I'm very proud of my accomplishments. My project is based on what I do, so it makes me proud to know I can succeed in that area," says Prosser.

Prosser's project was intended to answer whether vitamin C could alleviate negative effects of distiller's grains being used as an alternative to corn, such as lower weight gain.

To do so, she split two groups of related cattle in half and injected one group with supplemental Vitamin C and then weighed the two groups.

She then continued the feeding rations for forty days with the distiller's grains. After the forty days Prosser again weighed the cattle to find the average daily weight gain.

"I believe that projects about livestock, mainly cattle, are very meaningful and have a huge influence on the world," Prosser told the Drovers Cattle Network in a recent interview. "Projects like this, and my previous projects, could all propose a theory that could influence the way cattlemen carry out a certain task or idea."

Prosser also told Drovers Cattle Network,  "If many people would find a field they love, studying and working with it becomes fun instead of time-consuming and boring."
