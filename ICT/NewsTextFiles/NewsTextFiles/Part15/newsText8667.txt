
QUINCY TOWNSHIP &GT;&GT; A Greencastle man was cited with 27 counts of animal cruelty last month after investigators found 23 adult dogs and four puppies at a residence in the 8000 block Wayne Highway, Waynesboro.

Daniel J. Baer, 63, of 162 S. Carlisle St., allegedly had the dogs at the Wayne Highway residence "in a manner depriving them of access to clean and sanitary shelter," according to the citation.

On April 15 at 1:15 p.m., Humane Society Police officers Andrea Haugh and Dennis Bumbaugh went to the residence after receiving an anonymous report of dogs being house in unsanitary conditions, according to the citation.

Haugh and Bumbaugh found 27 dogs in enclosures in the residence, all with feces and a strong smell of ammonia present, according to court documents. The investigators also reported finding a dead rat in the residence. While at the residence, the investigators also witnessed a dog fight, which resulted in a dog requiring medical care.

The 27 charges are all non-traffic citations, or summary charges.

Baer is also facing a misdemeanor charge for not adhering to the Pennsylvania Dog Law requirements for a kennel, prohibition to operate.

These charges were filed on April 29 for Baer's property at 8782 Wayne Highway, Waynesboro, where he allegedly kept 27 dogs between January and April 15, without obtaining a kennel license. Owners are not allowed to keep more than 26 dogs at a residence within one calendar year, according to Pennsylvania Dog Law.

Baer has been convicted in at least one prior dog law violation, and was sentenced on Jan 14. Baer was ordered to pay $1,649 between the two charges. The charges stemmed from late 2013, and he faced more dog law charges earlier in the year.

Baer's preliminary hearing is set for June 17.
