
Four members of an aerial sports team used wingsuits to fly over the Manhattan skyline.

Â Four members of an aerial team did just that when they jumped out of a plane and cruised the skies above New York.

The iconic skyline was no hindrance to the four, who used special wingsuits to help them control the speed and direction of their flight.

It's not for the fainthearted though as they reached speeds of up to 120 miles/hour and cruised the two miles of the financial district in just under 2 minutes.

The team then landed in style on a barge on the Hudson river.
