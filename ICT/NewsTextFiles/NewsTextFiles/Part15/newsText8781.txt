
Columbus — The Ohio Senate has signed off on legislation that would require high school lessons in world history.

Senate Bill 96 calls for one unit of instruction of world history or civilizations as part of social studies classes, starting in the ninth grade.

Students are required to complete three units of social studies in order to receive their diplomas. One of those units, under state law, focuses on U.S. history and government.

World history is already being taught in all Ohio schools, because it is part of the state’s testing requirements, said Sen. Frank LaRose (R-Copley), the primary sponsor of the legislation.

However, tests in coming years will no longer include a world history section.

LaRose said the proposed law change would not stipulate a particular curriculum.

SB 96 passed on a vote of 31-0 and heads to the Ohio House for further consideration.
