
Chris Farrell, a spokesman for Judicial Watch, says the documents make the truth about the situation quite clear.

"There were of course attempts to blame the Cincinnati office and a few sort of rogue, low-level agents who were misguided,” he tells OneNewsNow. “And that lie has been exploded. It's not even plausible. These are well-documented email exchanges back and forth."

Farrell says it is foolish to think the IRS is stopping its campaign against conservative groups just because it's been exposed.
