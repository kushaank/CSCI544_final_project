
AL ABORTION LAW GOES TO COURT — Today a federal district judge in Alabama kicks off a multi-day trial on a state law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. It’s being challenged by Planned Parenthood and the ACLU, who say it constitutes unfair restrictions that could cause three of the state’s five abortion clinics to close. In a call on Friday to discuss that case — and a similar Wisconsin law also set to be heard in court later this month — the groups outlined their objections, along with Jeanne Conry, immediate past president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

--The rule included some clarifications on navigator requirements and a list of state requirements that would hamper them from doing their jobs. It’s a good first step in protecting navigators from some state limitations that are in effect right now, Christine Barber, a senior policy analyst at Community Catalyst (a group that works with many navigator organizations) told PULSE. For example, the rule says state laws that ban navigators from discussing specifics of plans (like those in Missouri and Georgia) are prohibitive to them. Barber said she doesn’t know what will happen to those laws, but having the rule is a positive step.
