
The Portage County Sheriff's Department tells NewsChannel 7, Deputy Tony Gischia is on paid administrative leave after a shooting earlier this month in Plover.  We're told it's standard procedure.

Officers were dispatched to Gischia's home for an intruder inside the residence and a shooting incident on May 17.  Police say a scuffle ensued; subsequently the masked intruder was shot and killed.

The Plover Police Department has released more details about an officer involved shooting over the weekend.

According to a press release,  officers from the Plover Police Department were dispatched to 2530 Easlan Dr in the Village of Plover for an intruder inside residence and a shooting incident.

The incident happened just after 1 a.m. Saturday, May 17.

Initial investigation revealed that off duty Deputy Tony Gischia with the Portage County Sheriffâ€™s Department and another individual returned home and was confronted by a masked intruder.

Police say a scuffle ensued; subsequently the masked intruder was shot and killed.

The intruder was identified as Charles Jameson, 30, of Stevens Point.

Police say Jameson was known to both Gischia and the other individual.

A vehicle which Jameson drove was found parked north of the residence on Easlan Dr.

Few details are being released about a shooting at the home of a Sheriff's Department employee in Portage County early Saturday morning, but Plover Police are now confirming one person did die in that incident.

The Plover Police were dispatched to a home on Easlan Drive in the Village of Plover just after 1:00 AM Saturday for reports of an intruder inside the home and a shooting.

The Police Chief assured neighbors this was an isolated incident and there is no continuing threat in the area.

While that's all the information law enforcement is releasing, neighbors have been painting a picture of what's all been going on at the residence.

Multiple neighbors told NewsChannel 7 the resident of the home was living with his girlfriend and the man found dead is the girlfriend's ex-boyfriend.

"The intent that he had [was] to kill," neighbor Elaina Schuh said. "He was going to burn down the place, so they had the fire department here for safety precautions and they had all of the hoses ready to go in case there was an accident."

Again, police have not confirmed that was the case.

Schuh and other neighbors say the Sheriff's Department employee and his girlfriend came home to find the man in their home. That's when the homeowner reportedly shot the man in self-defense.

Another neighbor told NewsChannel 7 the ex-boyfriend stalked the woman. Investigators went through his car, which is still at the scene.

"They took out the contents of his car and there were binoculars in his car," Schuh said. "So I mean with any guess, as a normal person could have guessed, he probably was watching them for a while."

Schuh maintains the neighborhood is safe and, although unsettled by the situation, she still feels comfortable in her home.
