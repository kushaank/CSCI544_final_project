NEW YORK--Copper prices marched higher on Monday as falling inventories of the industrial metal fanned concerns about a short-term supply squeeze, while nickel futures rebounded as investors refocused on Indonesia's export ban.

Copper for July delivery, the most actively traded contract, was recently up 1.90 cents, or 0.6%, at $3.1660 a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Copper prices have been heading higher in recent weeks, as worries about weaker demand for the metal from China appeared to have subsided. China is the world's top copper consumer, and signs that its economy was steadying had lent some support to the copper market.

Copper has also drawn support from concerns about a short-term shortfall in supply. Most industry analysts expect copper mine production to exceed demand in 2014, leading to the first supply surplus of the metal since 2009. But in recent months, global inventories of copper have been in decline.

Copper stored in the London Metal Exchange's global warehousing network, the world's largest metals-storage network, are at their lowest level since September 2008. Copper stocks are down 49% from the start of the year to 186,525 metric tons at the close of business on Friday, according to the latest data available.

The Shanghai Futures Exchange has seen its copper stockpiles drop by roughly half to 97,012 tons, while Comex inventories have hovered at around 17,000 short tons.

The tight availability of metal has been reflected in the futures market, with copper for immediate delivery trading at higher prices compared with metal for delivery at a later date, as traders are willing to pay a premium for access to supply.

"What's going on in the market is that supply is dwindling," said Michael Turek, director of metals trading with Newedge in New York.

Meanwhile, nickel prices are rebounding as investors continue to worry about supply. Nickel prices had rallied 51% since the start of the year after Indonesia, the world's largest nickel producer, in January banned the export of unprocessed nickel ore.

But futures pulled back roughly 12% last week, as some investors moved to lock in profits while others looked to the end of steelmaker restocking as auguring weaker demand for the stainless steel ingredient.

The move lower is a "solid buying opportunity," analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a report. They added that nickel prices would need to rise toward $22,000 a metric ton in order to incentivize building nickel smelting plants in Indonesia.

Nickel for delivery in three months was recently up 4.6% at $19,890 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange.
