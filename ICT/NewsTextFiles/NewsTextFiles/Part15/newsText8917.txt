
The full-service grocer signed a lease with the developers of a previously announced mixed-use project for a 30,000-square-foot store. The development, announced earlier this year , also includes a Starbucks , a parking deck and dozens of new apartment units.

But developers aren't stopping with early commitments from national-name tenants Publix and Starbucks.

Scott Bryant , who is developing the project with Dick Schmalz of RGS Properties, said they are trying to lease at least 40,000 additional square feet of retail space. All told, the development could include more than 155,000 square feet at the former Firestone and Adamson Ford properties.

â€œNow that we're to this point, we are in the position to go to market with our remaining space,â€� Bryant said.

Many real estate insiders have speculated that a grocery store â€“ along with more residents â€“ could be the catalyst to lure additional retailers downtown.

With Publix's commitment, that theory will soon be put to the test.

Of course, the development isn't the only one looking to attract retail to downtown Birmingham. Bayer Properties has been retained to lease retailers for the recently rebranded Station 121 property. And Bayer's Pizitz redevelopment will also include an open-style market concept.

Brokers have said that the historic nature of many downtown properties has limited retailer interest, although that won't be an issue in new construction projects like the Publix project.
