TRENTON — Gov. Chris Christie’s foreign policy speech Sunday night is facing some criticism at home — from a fellow Republican.

State Sen. Michael Doherty (R-Warren), one of the most conservative New Jersey lawmakers, said Christie’s vision for America’s role in the world is unsustainable.

Christie on Sunday night gave a hawkish speech calling for the United States to take a clearer role in world affairs.

"America is no longer sending clear signals to the world. Consistent signals," Christie said in front of a crowd of about 700 at the Champions of Jewish Values International Awards Gala in New York. "Signals like the ones Ronald Reagan sent when he was president as to who our friends are, and we will stand with them without a doubt, and who our enemies are, who we will oppose regardless of the cost."

Doherty supported former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, an anti-interventionist, for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012. Paul’s son, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), holds similar views and is considered a potential rival of Christie’s for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.
