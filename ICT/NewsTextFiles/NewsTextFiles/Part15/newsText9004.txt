
While Toyota, Japan’s largest employer, is preparing to move out almost all of its employees from the old Californian headquarters, the electric carmaker Tesla Motors stealthily snatched the position of biggest auto employer.

Tesla Motors, which is currently running a global expansion campaign, has quietly – just like its cars are riding – moved from a start-up company to a top state employer, announcing that it has a workforce of more than 6,000 people in the state, which puts it ahead of Toyota’s current 5,300 direct employees in California, which are anyways set to dwindle as the world’s largest automaker moves the US unit headquarters to Texas by 2017.

Also, according to Simon Sproule, a spokesman, Tesla looks to further add at least 500 people by the end of this year. This is rather an oddity, as the US state is known as a tough location for companies, due to high labor and energy costs as well as very tough environmental rules for manufacturing facilities. The electric carmaker was already since 2013 a larger California employer among technology based companies – besting for example Twitter Inc.’s 3,000 employees.
