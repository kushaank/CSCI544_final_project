Jorge Luis Perez Garcia, "Antunez," was arrested Sunday by the Castro police. Other activists took to Twitter to report what little is known about the circumstances of his arrest and his current whereabouts.

I met and broke bread with Antunez and his wife late last summer during their visit to the United States. I was already admirer but after seeing and hearing him first-hand, it was clear that he is the dynamic, courageous leader the Cuban resistance needs to fight the regime.

"Worth the trip."
