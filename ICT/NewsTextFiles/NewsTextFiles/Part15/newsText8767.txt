
Two recent events have aroused fresh debate and discussion on the matter of polygamy. The recent signing of the controversial Marriage Bill into law by the President, and the subsequent release of the Synovate research findings on Kenyans’ views on the same, have caused a new stir.

During debate in Parliament, women MPs walked out in protest after their male counterparts cheekily deleted a clause that would have given wives a say on whether or not the husband could bring in a subsequent wife.

The matter spilled into the public arena, generating animated discussions, with men and women taking predictable stands. Polygamy is an outdated cultural practice that has no place in modern Kenya — has been the line taken by women both in and outside Parliament. The men, however, have argued that polygamy is undeniably entrenched in our Africanness and cannot be wished away.

It is important to note though that polygamy is not just an African phenomenon as it has often been portrayed. This is a widespread practice across the globe that manifests in various forms.

King Solomon easily holds the polygamy record — 300 wives, 700 mpango wa kando!

The big question is why any man in his right mind would need so many women? But equally critical is why any dignified woman would accept to be the 2nd, 5th, or 299th wife; and yet believe that she alone is and will remain the beloved of her husband! It is a proven fact that the male nature seeks to conquer anything and everything in its wake, seeking for self-gratification. Whether it is the pursuit of business, career, gadgets, cars, property, orâ€¦yes — women; there will be no stopping for most men. Hence, when a man crosses the bounds of marriage and takes in another woman, whether as wife, concubine, or prostitute; there is no telling how far that man will go in pursuit of his passions.

Thus, whereas traditional polygamy was an organised and “dignified” affair — mainly founded on a social framework based on ignorance of a better way; at the centre of today’s polygamy is insatiable human wickedness. A man driven by beastly passions roams society seeking whom he might devour. A woman with opportunistic desperation becomes the easy prey. The two come into an unholy union that has never led to living happily ever after. According to the Synovate report, more Muslims (71 per cent) than Christians (58 per cent) surveyed wanted the ?rst wife’s approval to be a prerequisite.

This is interesting because while generally Islam allows for polygamy, Christianity does not. And yet more Muslims than Christians voted for seeking the existing wife or wives’ consent.

It does indicate that even Muslims, though practising polygamy, their women are not necessarily in approval. Indeed, in many countries, including India, Iran, Iraq, Bangladesh, Algeria, Lebanon, Morocco, Jordan, and Kuwait, women are allowed to include a clause prohibiting polygamy in marriage contracts.

Other countries, such as Iran and Pakistan, require that a man gets permission from his first wife before taking a second wife, and then show the court proof of such consent.
