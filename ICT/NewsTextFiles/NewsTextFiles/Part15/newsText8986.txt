
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Gold steadied on Monday after two consecutive sessions of losses but remained below the key $1,300-an-ounce level, weighed down by strong U.S. economic data and waning investor interest.

Platinum group metals added to gains after posting their strongest weekly performance in six weeks on supply worries from South African labour strikes.

Spot gold ticked up 0.2 percent to $1,295.70 an ounce by 0635 GMT, while platinum gained 0.7 percent. Palladium rose about half a percent.

"With generally bright U.S. economic data and euro zone's impending stimulus propping up dollar prospects, we are more inclined to a bearish break in gold prices," said Phillip Futures analyst Joyce Liu.

"That said, the Ukraine crisis continues to provide underlying support and any hint of escalation may spur gold prices above $1,300 again."

Gold, often seen as a safe-haven investment, has gained 7.5 percent so far this year from tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine though it has fallen back recently due to outflows from gold funds and strong data.
