
Unemployment rates have continued to decline, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics â€™ most recent economic news release.

But the good news is not evenly spread. According to the report, 47 states saw a drop in unemployment numbers from March to April, but the remaining three either saw no change in unemployment or, in one case, even an increase.

Utah continues to rank among the states with the lowest unemployment numbers, joined by Wyoming, Vermont, South Dakota, North Dakota and Nebraska as states with an unemployment rate below 4 percent. The national average currently sits at 6.3 percent.

True unemployment numbers are much worse when you factor in those Americans that have stopped looking for work & given up.  They drop out of the unemployment numbers when they lose benefits & are no longer counted.
