
After a particularly wet snow season, a section of Wyoming Highway 130 may be reopened by Memorial Day. Spokesman for the Wyoming Department of Transportation, Ross Doman, says although a recent snowstorm has slowed efforts to clear the road, WYDOT still hopes to get the highway between mile markers 35 and 48 reopened for the holiday. The stretch of road closes each year due to snow.

This year in particular, efforts to clear the highway have been slowed. The most recent snowstorm put up to 40 new inches of snow on that section of the highway, which required WYDOT to plow back to the area on which they were working. In addition, this year’s snow fall has been very wet, making it heavy and more difficult to remove.

Drivers often use this part of the highway because it lowers travel time to towns like Saratoga, Baggs and Encampment when coming from Laramie, Cheyenne or parts of Colorado. The highway is also regularly traveled for the scenic drive, as it can have walls of snow over 10-feet high in the beginning of the summer season.
