
WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) - A lovingly preserved vestige of Virginia's plantation past is heading to auction this week.

Carter's Grove will be listed at $14.9 million at the auction Wednesday. The plantation is being sold because a dot-com entrepreneur who purchased it lost his fortune and fell deeply into debt.

The property outside of Williamsburg includes an 18,700-square-foot mansion that is listed as a National Historic Landmark, a caretaker's house, stables and 400 grassy acres that slope to more than a mile of frontage on the James River.

The plantation house is considered the finest example of Georgian architecture in Virginia and among the best in the U.S.

It features dazzling brick and wood flourishes by Old World craftsmen that have survived more than 250 years after its construction.
