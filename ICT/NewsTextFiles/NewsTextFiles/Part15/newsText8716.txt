
New affordable housing is coming to Thomasville. On Monday city leaders broke ground on the first house in the Victoria Park neighborhood.

Homes will be built through the land bank authority of Thomasville and Thomas County. It's about a $2.5 million investment that the mayor says is worth every penny.

The state Department of Community Affairs, contributions from local companies, and other private donations helped to move the project forward. If your interested in buying one of the homes contact Barbara Curry with the city of Thomasville planning 229.227.7000.
