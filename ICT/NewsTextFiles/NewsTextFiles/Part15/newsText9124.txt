
STOCKTON, CA (KCRA/CNN) – Two men are in jail, accused of kidnapping to perform an exorcism.

Deputies say a man, along with his son, took his ex-wife against her will, thinking she was possessed by demons.

At a Walmart parking lot in North Stockton on Saturday, 42-year-old Jose Magana-Farias and 20-year-old Victor Farias arranged to meet up with the mother under the guise of wanting to make the marriage work.

Not knowing what was in store, she willingly got in the car.

Deputies said the two thought she had undergone some drastic changes recently and was possessed by demons.

Along the way they picked up a priest in South Stockton, and another priest at a second location to hold an exorcism.

According to the report, the priests doused her with “sacred oils” and “purified her” through a religious ritual.

Deputies said no torture was involved.

The victim’s roommate who lived nearby alerted deputies to the kidnapping.

She was found, unharmed.

Both father and son are being held in jail on suspicion of kidnapping, false imprisonment and conspiracy to commit a crime.

My question is what happened to the “priests”. No priest I’ve ever known would do an exorcism under these circumstances.

Yeah the “drastic changes” were the fact she realized the marriage probably was over and that both men were morons.
