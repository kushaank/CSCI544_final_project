
A dentist in the US has been suspended after a patient died having 20 teeth extracted in one session.

Dr Rashmi Patel, of Enfield, Connecticut was performing the procedure on 64-year-old Judith Gan on February 17 when she gurgled and lost consciousness, the Journal Inquirer reports.

Ms Gan was rushed to Baystate Medical Centre in nearby Springfield where she was pronounced dead.

Patel will face a June 18 hearing before the Connecticut State Dental Commission, accused of negligence causing death.

The state alleges Patel failed to act when Ms Gan's oxygen levels dropped and should not have attempted to extract so many teeth in one visit.

Patel's assistant begged him to stop but he "wanted to complete the placement of implants" after the teeth had been pulled, the state Department of Public Health wrote in a report, according to the Hartford Courant.

The assistant "finally ran out and called 911, but the patient had already flat-lined," according to state records.

Patel's attorney Michael Kogut says there is no medical information suggesting that the dentist's actions resulted in the woman's death.

The cause of Ms Gan's death is yet to be determined but it is believed the grandmother had prior health issues.
