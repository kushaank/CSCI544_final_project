
Centre of Administration for Peace and Order (CAPO) has summoned acting Senate Speaker Surachai Liengboonlertchai to answer a complaint and suspected evidence that he supports rally leader Suthep Thaugsuban, who is facing a charge of insurrection.

CAPO’s Tarith Pengdit said he already signed the summons against Surachai, based on the suspicion that he attempted to have an unelected premier according to the constitution’s Article 7.

The summons ordered Surachai to report to on Wednesday at 2pm.

Suthep, who is leading the anti-government rally, has called for the country to undergo political reform before an election under a neutral premier, who would administer the country. The government, who has Niwutthamrong Boonsongpaisan as the acting caretaker premier, insists that an election be held prior to the reforms.

The caretaker government and the pro-government red shirts, have criticised Surachai for taking sides with Suthep.
