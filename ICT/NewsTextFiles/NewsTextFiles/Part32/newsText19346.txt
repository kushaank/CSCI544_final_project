
Kenya: The reality of the standard gauge railway (SGR) was highlighted when the Prime Minister of China and the President of Kenya put pen to paper in the presence of regional presidents at a State House event.

The GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s commitment to bringing positive reform in the trade logistics industry is, therefore, not in doubt.

The projectÃ¢Â€Â™s objective is to reduce cargo clearance time at key trade nodes like the Port of Mombasa, Jomo Kenya International Airport (for air freight) and borders.

This will be achieved by implementing a single platform to process trade -related cargo clearance documentation.

The two events are very closely related in trade logistics, especially in cargo evacuation from the Port of Mombasa into the region, which explains the regional interest in both events. It is also not by coincidence that Kenya hosted both events since we are both the gateway to East Africa and the big brother in the regional economy.

My interest is in the launch of e-SWS, which is the feeder to the second event and should create a synchronised system and provide the much-needed magic to make trade facilitation in the northern corridor more effective.

However, there are some concerns. First, it is important to note that rail wagons can only have cargo loaded for a destination after an order from the Kenya Ports Authority. However, for KPA to issue the order, it must receive clearance from all invested Government agencies.

My worry, and that of many other clearing agents, is that in the event the wagons have to wait longer for cargo to be loaded, the blame for the delay will rest squarely on the agents, who will then be branded corrupt, inefficient and unprofessional.

This would be far from the truth, and the e-SWS should provide the much-needed efficiency to ensure cargo is quickly evacuated from the port into wagons for onward transport.
