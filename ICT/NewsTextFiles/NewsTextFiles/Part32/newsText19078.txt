
Neo-Nazi forces in Ukraine are waging a war against civilians, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated in an interview with China's leading media, pointing out that a revision of the results of the Second World War is inadmissible. "Consequences (of such a revision) would be utterly dangerous; this is evidenced by the present-day tragic events in Ukraine, the rampancy of neo-Nazi forces that unleashed a veritable terror against civilians," President Putin emphasized.

"Of course, we shall continue to resist attempts at falsifying history, at heroizing fascists and their henchmen, and at casting aspersions on the memory and good name of liberation heroes," he said.

"A little more than 20 years ago Russia and China succeeded to reach an unprecedentedly high level of comprehensive strategic partnership, which is based on mutual respect and trust, taking into account mutual interests, mutually beneficial cooperation and non-interference in domestic affairs," he said.

"Contacts between the leaders of our countries play an important role in the process of mutual rapprochement between Russia and China. Russia praises the fact that Chinese President Xi Jinping had made his first foreign visit after taking the post of president to Moscow in March 2013. Then, leaders of our countries met several more times and President Vladimir Putinâ€™s visit to China will certainly be an important landmark event in relations between our leaders," Denisov said, adding that "Moscow and Beijing value special nature of bilateral partnership and consider its further development as a priority trend of their foreign policy."

Russian President Vladimir Putin will pay an official visit to China on May 20 at the invitation of his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, the Kremlin press service has reported, according to Interfax.

The leaders of Russia and China are expected to meet in Shanghai to discuss some of the key issues on the bilateral agenda.

In addition to that, a set of important documents concerning the two countries' cooperation in trade, business, the energy sector and humanitarian affairs should be signed during Putin's visit to China.

The sides will also discuss the present-day state of Russian-Chinese contacts in the international arena and their prospects.

Putin's visit is expected to herald a new stage of bilateral relations accompanied by a comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation, the Kremlin press service said.

"Joint work to step up international stability, create conditions for broad international co-operation, take joint actions to settle global regional problems is a basis of foreign political philosophy of our country," the Russian foreign minister noted.

"A good example of mutually beneficial partnership is unprecedentedly high level of Russian-Chinese relations which turn in an increasingly significant factor in world politics," Lavrov said, adding that "There are also relations within the troika (three) of Russia, India and China and between the BRICS states (the developing-nation assembly of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) which develop actively their ties with regional structures in Latin America and on other continents."
