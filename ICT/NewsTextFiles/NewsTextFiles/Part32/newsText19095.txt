There may be some regional problems, but for this veteran, the VA in our area is A-OK.

Veterans listen to speakers at the Pearl Harbor Commemoration at the Suffern Village Hall on Dec. 8, 2013.

There is much in the media recently criticizing the Veterans Administration regarding its treatment of veterans.

According to some reports the VA is failing our veterans; it is incompetent; veterans are not being attended to; and in some cases are dying on waiting lists.

Even if half-true, this is disturbing news.

It disturbs me because I am a veteran and I have been treated by the VA since 1980.

I have been treated at Castle Point Veteran's Hospital, Bronx VA Hospital, Montrose Hospital and the VA clinic in New City.

The entire staff at these facilities are courteous, friendly, helpful and extremely competent.

They go out of their way to help the veteran.

I would like to add that because of their scrupulous records, followup and treatment, I am in fair health today at 73.

There may be some regional problems with the Veterans Administration in certain states, which I hope will be attended to and quickly corrected, but for this veteran, the VA in our New York area is A-OK.
