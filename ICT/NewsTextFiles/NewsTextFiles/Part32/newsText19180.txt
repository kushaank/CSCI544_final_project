
A survey by the Financial Markets Authority has found more people are confident in New Zealand's financial markets, but half are still unsatisfied with investment material they receive.

The FMA surveyed 1000 people and found that overall confidence in financial markets was 59 percent, up five percentage points compared with last year.

However, only 53 percent with investments said the materials they received about those were helpful in making an informed decision.

The FMA said this is consistent with other feedback it has received.

The number of people holding some form of investment, which includes stock market shares, KiwiSaver and managed funds or bonds, nudged up three percentage points to 75 percent.

FMA chief executive Rob Everett said the authority was pleased that overall confidence is up, but that is to be expected in rising markets.
