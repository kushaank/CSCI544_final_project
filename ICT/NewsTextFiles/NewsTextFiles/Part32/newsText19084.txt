
SEOUL, May 19 (Yonhap) -- A tearful President Park Geun-hye offered a fresh apology Monday for the messed-up response to the deadly sinking of the ferry Sewol, promising deep-cutting reforms to make South Korea a safer nation to live in, including dismantling the Coast Guard and creating a new safety agency.

The nationally televised address came about a month after the Sewol went down on April 16, leaving more than 300 people, mostly high school students, dead or missing and the entire nation grieving and wondering bitterly why more lives could not have been saved.
