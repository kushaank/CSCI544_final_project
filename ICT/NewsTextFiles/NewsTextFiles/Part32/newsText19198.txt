Fund-raising has begun at the Serbian embassy in Canberra, as Serbia faces the worst floods in a century, which have left dozens dead and thousands more homeless.

The embassy announced they had opened a fund-raising account on Monday, from which donations will be sent directly to the Serbian government to assist with the relief effort.

More than 44 people have died in the floods , which have also affected parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and about 10,000 people have been evacuated from their homes in the worst-hit areas.

Serbian embassy first secretary Zoran Marinkovic said the money collected would be sent straight to his country to help the relief being co-ordinated by the Red Cross and the government.

"This level of flooding has never been recorded."

Mr Marinkovic said no fund-raising events were currently being co-ordinated directly by the embassy but the Serbian community was coming together across Australia to raise money.

He said although they needed to raise as much money as possible, every little bit helped.

Embassy of Bosnia and Herzegovina chargé d'affaires Dinko Tomac said his embassy was not undertaking any fund-raising activities directly but was assisting the community in collecting donations.

However, he said his embassy would be involved in co-ordinating the international response to the environmental disaster.

"We will this week contact Australian authorities and New Zealand authorities regarding our government's international appeal for assistance for the victims of the floods," he said.
