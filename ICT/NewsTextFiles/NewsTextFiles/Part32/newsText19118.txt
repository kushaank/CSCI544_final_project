
Former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member and lawyer Ram Jethmalamani, on Monday stated that if the new incoming BJP-led NDA Government doesn't bring in people with clean credentials at the helm as ministers, it risks facing the same consequences as the Congress had seen with its defeat in the general elections.

"The new government has to fulfill the promises made to the people. The first expectation I have from this government is to have a cabinet of honest people and only this will produce confidence in the people. If it does not happen then what happened to the Congress will also have fatal effect on the BJP," Jethmalamani said.
