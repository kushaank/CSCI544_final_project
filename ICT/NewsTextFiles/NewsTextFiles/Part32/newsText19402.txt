
New Delhi: Prime Minister-designate Narendra Modi is set to meet President Pranab Mukherjee on Tuesday and stake claim to form the new government. Ahead of that the Bharatiya Janata Party's parliamentary board will anoint him as their leader.

Advani will be proposing Modi's name at the parliamentary board meeting and senior leaders Venkaiah Naidu, Jaitley, Murli Manohar Joshi, Sushma Swaraj among others will second it.

Meanwhile, jockeying for key posts in Team Modi has intensified. Sources say BJP President Rajnath Singh will get the Home Ministry while Arun Jaitley could be the new Finance Minister.

Sources also say that Murli Manohar Joshi could be the Defence Minister. However, sources add that party patriarch LK Advani could be asked to be a guiding light for the party.

Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar also met Modi in Delhi on Tuesday morning. BJP ally Shiromani Akali Dal's chief Parkash Singh Badal has said that his party will not accept any ministry.

Hectic meetings have been continuing since May 16, the day the BJP got absolute majority. There have been meetings between the BJP and RSS leaders too, to chalk out who gets what post in Modi's Cabinet.

Meanwhile, the date of Modi's oath taking ceremony is also likely to be decided on Tuesday in the BJP's parliamentary board meeting. The top four ministers will be sworn in along with Modi during the oath-taking ceremony.
