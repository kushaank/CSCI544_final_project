Russia supported a project initiated by China and the United States for the creation of the APEC alliance for complementary development of supply chains. Its main task is to reveal and solve problems as part of the APEC action plan to ensure the interconnection of supply chains, interaction of technical experts and define resources needed for effective realization of projects. The action plan is a document, comprising various aspects of international interaction, designed to step up closer and more effective ties among the APEC economies. The document will reflect the achievements of APEC economies and regional problems; formulate approaches to overcoming trade barriers and set concrete quality targets.
