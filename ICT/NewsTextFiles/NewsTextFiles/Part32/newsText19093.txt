
The real question is whether Modi will ever visit US? My guess is that he would not. But then who knows? He might come to UN and meet Obama on the sideline? I think Modi will concentrate on China, Japan and Russia despite his love for Regan's doctrine. He will visit US if next president is a Republican? Again, that is my guess. And, I could be very wrong.

With regards,
