
Niwattumrong Boonsongpaisan, Thailand's current acting prime minister, assured the press that his government would not resign, and that it would be unconstitutional for him to do so.

The civil unrest in Thailand has resulted in 28 deaths and hundreds of injuries during protests. The anti-government factions have promised to call off their rallies by May 26 if they have not proven successful in their goal to "oust the government and install an unelected prime minister and government."

The Senate, the only  functioning legislative body in the country, was seen as the last resort  of the anti-government protesters, who are calling for an interim,  unelected prime minister to be chosen.

An unnamed army general who spoke with Reuters confirmed that the martial law is not a coup, stating it was instead a state of emergency.

"We declared a state of emergency, it's not a coup. Because of the situation, it's not stable, they kill each other every day."
