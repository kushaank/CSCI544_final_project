
NORWALK -  Volunteers in Norwalk made Memorial Day preparations Saturday by placing flags on the graves of veterans in St. Johnâ€™s Cemetery.

King Industries in Norwalk sponsored the event.

Bob King, the company's director of operations, also a veteran, says the flags are a simple way of saying thank you.
