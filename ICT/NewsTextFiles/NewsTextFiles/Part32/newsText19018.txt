
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Indian Energy, the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy's Tribal Energy Program, and the Western Area Power Administration (Western) will present the next Tribal Renewable Energy Series webinar, Renewable Energy Project Refinement, on Wednesday, May 28, 2014, from 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Mountain time.

The third step of the process developed by the DOE Office of Indian Energy and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to help guide Tribes on the path toward successful tribal renewable energy project development, project refinement involves key processes such as finalizing ownership structures and closing financing.

NREL Renewable Energy Analyst Travis Lowder will walk through various financing options that may help Tribes overcome barriers to accessing capital. “The goal of the refinement stage is to allocate outstanding risks, settle on project structures, get the financing in the door, and from there, put the steel in the ground,” said Lowder.

Guest speakers Roderick Phillip (Chaninik Wind Group, AK), Ken Duncan (San Carlos Apache, AZ), and Nathan Karman (Forest County Potawatomi Community, WI) will present case studies that illustrate how taking proactive measures to mitigate project risk can help accelerate renewable energy development, and with it, tribal economic and community development.
