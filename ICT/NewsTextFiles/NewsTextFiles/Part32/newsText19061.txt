
New Delhi:  YSR Congress chief Jaganmohan Reddy on Monday met  Prime Minister designate Narendra Modi and announced issue based support  to the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre.

Jagan said Modi responded positively to the problems put forward by him and added that his party would provide issue based support to the new government.

He said that his party would expect full cooperation from the National Democratic Alliance.

“We met Narendra Modi and highlighted our problems for the budget, he responded positively-Jaganmohan Reddy,” Jagan said after meeting Modi.

“We will surely be giving him(Modi) issue based support and expect cooperation,” he added.

There are whispers in the political circles that one of the major reasons why Jagan met Modi is to take assurance from him that Telugu Desam Party chief Chandrababu Naidu won’t open his corruption cases again as he is set to become the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh.

Jagan had recently conceded that the major reason behind his party’s dismal show in the state was the high-flying NaMo wave.
