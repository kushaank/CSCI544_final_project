
West Virginia lawmakers return to legislative session with several items on the table, including a fix to the minimum wage bill.

There's also the restoration of funding to the Courtesy Patrol program left out of the new state budget.

And Delegate John Ellem (R - Wood) says a group of lawmakers want the governor to reconsider the Fetal Pain Bill he vetoed earlier this year.

"We're trying to do a really unusual, seldom used mechanism to call ourselves into session so we could address his veto of the Fetal Pain Bill," he says. "That's probably the most controversial issue that's going on right now."

According to Governor Tomblin, the pro-life supported bill had legal problems.

It would have made abortions illegal after 20 weeks.
