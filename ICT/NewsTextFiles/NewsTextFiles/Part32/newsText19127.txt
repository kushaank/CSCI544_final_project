
SEOUL, May 19 (Yonhap) -- The government will mobilize budgets spread among ministries and agencies to better cope with disasters, the finance minister said Monday.

The remarks by Hyun Oh-seok, who also serves as deputy prime minister, come as South Korea mourns the deaths of some 300 people in the sinking of the 6,825-ton ferry Sewol on April 16.

The disaster has raised a public furor over the government's disaster response capabilities. An ongoing investigation strongly suggests more lives could have been saved if the government had acted faster.

"Our disaster-related budget is included in the public order and safety category, as guided by organizations like the IMF and the OECD, and the budget in that category for this year stands at about 15.8 trillion won (US$15.4 billion)," Hyun told lawmakers during a briefing on government policies.

"The government will use not just the money but also other diverse budgets assigned for each ministry and agency, and if the amount is not enough, it could redirect other budget spending and tap into reserve funds in order not to cause any problems in providing fiscal support," he added.

Hyun also said that the country's public safety budgets will be focused on training people against disasters, putting in place appropriate response systems and developing methods and technologies needed to prevent national catastrophes.

Asked how the government will handle the rising safety-related spending, Hyun said that the government will review its budget situation to reduce spending in less important areas and think about expanding its revenue base.

He also said the government is planning to provide broad support for the ferry victims and their families, including medical care and job opportunities.
