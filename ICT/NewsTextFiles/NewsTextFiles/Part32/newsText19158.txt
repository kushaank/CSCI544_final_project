Gov. Robert Bentley’s outgoing chief of staff, David Perry, right, talks to well-wishers after speaking Monday in Montgomery.

Gov. Robert Bentley may have missed the “mini-state of the state” address he was scheduled to give Monday in Montgomery, but he was there in spirit.

Pastor John Schmidt asked those in attendance to pray for Bentley to make wise decisions. Then Bentley’s replacement at the event, outgoing Chief of Staff David Perry, spent much of his keynote speech praising Bentley’s vision, work ethic, job recruitment efforts and more.

Days after a new unemployment report showed that the state’s jobless rate rose for the third straight month, Perry said a look “behind the artificial numbers” shows that the rate is rising because people are more optimistic and are returning to the workforce.

Perry declined to discuss the unemployment picture further after the speech, referring questions to Commerce Secretary Greg Canfield.

Bentley cited a schedule conflict in cancelling his speech.

Former state lawmaker Seth Hammett officially took over Monday as Bentley’s new chief of staff, and Perry described his own role for the next week as just an advisor.

But Perry stuck tightly to the script, complimenting Bentley-led efforts to streamline a “bloated” state workforce, encourage career tech programs and rebuild budgets that were “in shambles” in 2011.

“He will continue doing that, hopefully, for four and a half more years,” Perry said.

While he said Alabama needs an overhaul of its recruitment incentives programs at the state level, he praised Montgomery’s recent success in landing jobs. He credited the local leadership teams at the city and county levels, as well as the Chamber and the business community.
