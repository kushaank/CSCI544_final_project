Wake County Manager Jim Hartmann presented the county's $1.063 billion proposed budget to county commissioners on Monday.

While it includes $10 million more for education, it does not include a 3.5 percent pay increase for Wake County teachers that was requested by the school system.

Monday's presentation was the first big test for the proposed budget for Wake County schools. The superintendent and school board were asking for $40 million more this year. The $30 million over what's in the county budget would have funded the teacher pay raises.

On Tuesday, Wake County schools fired back.

School Board Chair Christine Kushner says the fight is not over and that each board member will be reaching out to commissioners to try to change their minds.

"We're going to have to recruit more than a thousand teachers, we do that on a normal year. And this year, with the uptick in retirement and teachers leaving the teaching profession, we're going to be recruiting more teachers for the fall. So we need a competitive salary for teachers and staff members now," Kushner said.

North Carolina currently ranks near the bottom nationally for teacher pay. Wake County education leaders have complained that many teachers are leaving for bigger paychecks elsewhere.

Hartmann said Monday the county did not include a raise because Governor Pat McCrory is proposing one at the state level.
