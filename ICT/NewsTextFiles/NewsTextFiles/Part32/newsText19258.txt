Between weddings and funerals, 2013 was an expensive year for the Swedish royals, who released their annual set of accounts today. The Royal Court went SEK 2 million over budget.

Starting this year, the Royal Court is required to show more transparency and detail in how they spend their grant of public money. This after a parliamentary decision in 2011 established that the economy of the royals should be more closely monitored.

The results for 2013 show that the court went roughly SEK two million over budget. Considering the circumstances, that is a rather good result, according to the court's chief financial officer Jan Lindman.

"We've had a royal wedding, the king has celebrated 40 years on the throne, we've had a funeral, we had a visit from president Obama. So we think it's good that we only have a deficit of two million," he told Swedish Radio News.

Next year, the royals will have to tighten their purse strings to cover the deficit. If not, the king will have to use his own private funds to cover the family's extra expenditure, said Jan Lindman.

"We'll do what all other organizations do: We're going to try to be more efficient, work in a smarter way and use modern technology," he said.

But it is not just the royal family that has exceeded the budget. The body in charge of the royal palaces, art collections and other cultural heritage was SEK 2.6 million short as well, mostly due to hiring extra staff.
