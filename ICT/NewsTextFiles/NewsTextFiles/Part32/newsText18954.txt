
After successfully killing them off, I understand that the government is planning to revive the cooperative bank as well as cooperative unions.

Surprisingly, it has taken close to three decades for this government to realise how important cooperatives were to Ugandans!

This might sound like a fairytale for the young generation, but make no mistake, there was simply no institution in Uganda that worked like cooperative unions.

I can remember some powerful ones such as Banyankore Kweterana Cooperative Union, which, apart from owning hotels, helped farmers to secure markets and loans.

There was also West Mengo Cooperative Union and the one that has continued to limp on, despite the internal politics, Bugisu Cooperative Union. Very few can forget Uganda Cooperative Transport Union (UCTU), probably the leading transporters of goods to the port of Mombasa at the time. They owned so many trucks, trailers and buses, which were always available to Ugandans.

And of course there was the Cooperative bank, which essentially acted as the financial banker to the many unions at the time. Because the cooperative unions used to advance payments to the farmers, quality of the produce was guaranteed and returns assured.

Many people then did not have to borrow, but, rather, work hard and use their land to supply what their mother cooperative unions demanded. Some were paid upfront and this business of parents failing to pay school fees or meeting basic needs was not an issue.

Because the executives of these co-operative unions were so powerful and close to the farmers, they wielded lots of powers. In many cases, a Cabinet minister was less powerful than a chairman of a cooperative union.

If and when this chairman favoured a particular politician, chances were high that that candidate would take the constituency. And because much of the politics then was a contest between UPC and DP, majority of chairmen of cooperative unions were government-leaning.

Now, if you were a new government coming to power, it was inevitable to look to where the centres of power were. So, when the NRA took power in 1986, the power centres were clear. The first was the army. The second were the existing political parties, while the third were the civilian organisations such as churches, mosques and cooperative unions.

Thus, the new government had to systematically dismantle these centres by ensuring that they were weakened so as to have limited leverage on the central politics. Little wonder that it was around this time that, suddenly, the mainstream churches of Catholics, Protestants and Seventh Day Adventists started falling under.

The likes of Charismatic Catholics and Pentecostal churches emerged, while the Muslim sector too had its share of divisions that are still apparent to date. And the same happened in political parties that were allied to a particular faith (DP to the Catholic Church and UPC to Protestants). These became less functional.

If cooperatives are to do what they are supposed to do – working for the people – what we need is the separation of politics from the good intentions of serving the poor. Remember, when cooperative unions worked, people paid graduated tax – for they then worked and were sure about their incomes.

Yes, definitely we need cooperatives, just ask NM! Great article.

Dimas, the record shows that all the intentions of this government are too good to be true! That is why non of their programmes have worked.

The Cooperatives had to be dealt a death blow, because as you have mentioned; it is the only organization where there is democracy at the place of work.

And the NRM, especially M7 is allergic to genuine democracy; because he just can't win democratically on a level play ground.

They destroyed the cooperatives, because they wanted to start their funny nigina (Saccos).

They destroyed the Uganda Cooperative Transport Union (UCTU)and Uganda Railways, because they wanted to start their own trucking companies and dominate.

They destroyed UTC because they wanted to start their own bus companies.

They destroyed the Uganda Hotels, because they were obsessed with hotel lifestyle and take over those hotels for keep.

Throughout the four corners of the country, the Uganda Hotels provided standard services: standard linen, cutlery, China-wares, standard foods and beverages e.g. coffee, etc.

They destroyed the Dairy Corporation and UDC Abattoirs because they wanted to dominate the dairy and beef industries.

They Destroyed the Produce Marketing Board, because they want to be monopolists in the grain industry.

They destroyed the Uganda Airline, because they want to own, not only the airline, but also manage the Entebbe Airport facility. Etc, etc.

They destroyed quality public schools because they wanted to start their private schools.

They destroyed quality public services, because they want to start their clinic and private hospitals.

Let anybody prove me wrong!

to put everything under control, we can use the existing banks like centenary bank. it has survived the pressure of Musevenis;s interference to remain a Ugandan bank.

Putting money in cooperative bank with its history, will rise question marks.

Good article and good responses. The fact is Uganda under these bush men is a reincarnation of George Orwel's Animal farm.

In uganda there's not a single area, institution, sector, organisation etc etc that is functioning. I want anyone to tell me of any that can be talked about.

Ug is a true & complete description of a failed state.

A country of 36 million people.

Co-operatives would be very good, but the problem is, the people who destroyed them in the first place would never allow them to operate independently. We have micro-managers, not leaders.

Where on earth do you find a leader who has no time to rest/holiday, pretending that he is always busy? Doing what?He wants to do everything, rendering his ministers & advisers redundant.

The whole plan is just a still birth.

FYI.... Coooperative Bank was destroyed and unceremoniously shut down. The articles talks about a new bank doing what Co-op Bank used to do.

Prophet, you must add, they destroyed families only for the fair partners to be begging from them for survival. Women empowerment has led to food meant for local consumption being exported by nrm bigwigs to TZ, Kenya, Rwanda and Sudan.

Even the trucks are used on pot holed single track rat runs because some pregnant men with pea sized brains stole moneys meant to maintain roads. Hospitals are death traps, schools are where children learn to beg and steal. And we must have more of it to keep the pigs happy lest the sky falls down!

Crane bank is a conduit for funds looted from state coffers. Yosif must be patted on the back for being a merciless stakeholder out to suck till he is no more.

National Bank Of Commerce forgot to buy UCB for $2. Is Sud Rup not working for the Mafiosi? God's banker indeed! The Temangalos must be laughing at Banyakigezi for being some poisonous mushrooms of sorts.

webeshixty, the proprietor of Crane Bank (name withheld) is a Loan Shark! As a result very many any wishful-thinking businessmen and women got bitten badly.

Because they were so naive, and without rooms for legal fight; they miserably lost their priceless prime properties.
