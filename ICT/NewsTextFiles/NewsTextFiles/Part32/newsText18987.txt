
As warm weather draws Alaskans out to go boating, responders say it also increases calls for boating rescues. They're asking for people to help protect themselves this season and avoid boating fatalities.

The Eagle River Fire Department has an ambulance that sometimes pulls an inflatable rescue boat behind the ambulance. Firefighter Mark Glatt said they have need to use it about six times during the summer season.

The river running along Eagle River Campground looks deceptively calm, where just around the bend are some rapids and a tall treacherous-looking log jam. A sign on the left bank warns those on the river to pull out and inspect the river before braving the next turn.

Glatt said the most common mistake he sees is people taking on more than they're ready for. He said many people don't use the most basic safety equipment.

"It's unbelievable the amount of people that float down this river without a personal flotation device," Glatt said.

The rescue crews wear the vests when working anywhere near water. Glatt said after two women were killed by a log jam while canoeing in 2012, the department has put an increased emphasis on public information. While rescuers can get to a distressed person quickly, Glatt says the water sometimes move faster.

"Even with the slow current, if you're not careful, you can end up in a bad situation," Glatt said.
