
There is a growing push by inflation hawks to get the Fed to raise interest rates. We should recognize that inflation hawks are not willing to rely on honest arguments.

MAX BLUMENTHAL, AUTHOR, JOURNALIST, AND BLOGGER: It's election day in Newark, New Jersey, and a financially troubled city plagued with violent crime is set to decide its next mayor.

CHRIS CHRISTIE, GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY: I'm in charge of the public schools. In the city of Newark, as governor, I'm going to empower Mayor Booker to develop that plan and to implement it with a superintendent of schools that we're going to pick together.

BLUMENTHAL: Local residents' anger is focused on Newark schools superintendent Cami Anderson.

CAMI ANDERSON, SUPERINTENDENT, NEWARK PUBLIC SCHOOLS: Nobody is excited about school closures. I get that, because it's very emotional. At the same time--.

BLUMENTHAL: An education reform cadre who works under Chris Christie with no accountability to the local community. That anger boiled over when she introduced her One Newark school reorganization plan, a recipe for school closures and mass teacher firings.

BLUMENTHAL: Established political bosses who control New Jersey politics rallied around Baraka's opponent, a civil rights lawyer and former assistant state attorney general named Shavar Jeffries.

SHAVAR JEFFRIES, MAYORAL CANDIDATE, NEWARK, N.J.: Too many of our schools continue to struggle to provide our young people with the high-quality education they deserve.

BLUMENTHAL: As a cofounder of the TEAM Academy charter school network, Jeffries has also won fervent support from the powerful education reform movement.

At Jeffries' Central Ward headquarters, we met his wife, Tenagne Jeffries, a local businesswoman who has taken an active role in campaign strategy.

TENAGNE JEFFRIES, WIFE OF SHAVAR JEFFRIES: [Shavar] is totally--I mean, he served the district as school board president because he believes in public schools. He happened to start and he founded TEAM Charter Schools because he believed in choice.

Ras is trying to create this story about Shavar that's one that's so fictitious, you know, that he's--you know, him and Christie are in bed with each other. Bottom line is that Shavar is going to work with whoever the leadership is that he needs to work with, but he's very bold and independent. He was the underdog. If you look at it, Shavar was always counted out. He's the one. He is the grassroots movement of Newark.

SHAVAR JEFFRIES SUPPORTER: Yeah.

SHAVAR JEFFRIES SUPPORTER: One-fifty.

BLUMENTHAL: One-fifty? So they paid you each $150? Are you in school or--.

SHAVAR JEFFRIES SUPPORTER: No, they didn't pay us yet.

SHAVAR JEFFRIES SUPPORTER: They teach us about him. They tell us--they ask us if we want to do it.

SHAVAR JEFFRIES SUPPORTER: You guys want to, yeah, hold the poles.

BLUMENTHAL: Oh. Okay.

SHAVAR JEFFRIES SUPPORTER: Then we said--.

NOOR: We're with The Real News.

JOSHUA, SHAVAR JEFFRIES SUPPORTER: The Real News? So if I snatch your shit and I break it--.

SHAVAR JEFFRIES SUPPORTER: Josh. Joshua.

SHAVAR JEFFRIES SUPPORTER: Come on.

NOOR: I'm just asking how much you're getting paid today.

JOSHUA, SHAVAR JEFFRIES SUPPORTER: That's not for you to ask me, my brother.

UNIDENTIFIED: We can't answer that. We can't. Can you just, like, drive off? Thank you.

AKILI BUCHANAN, VP, NEWARK TEACHERS UNION: They are hiring high school kids to cut school in various high schools around this town, cut school and to--.

BLUMENTHAL: Hold up the Jeffries sign and--.

BUCHANAN: Yes, hold up Jeffries sings and--.

BLUMENTHAL: We saw them around.

BRIAN HOHMANN, FMR. NEWARK PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER: I mean, who knows? I mean, Newark has a history dating back to 1967 where there was a revolt. You know. And I wouldn't claim that there or predict there is one on the way, but, you know, the conditions seem to be moving in a direction where they're--you know, a certain ordinary action could lead to a combustible result.

BLUMENTHAL: We're here at Ras Baraka campaign headquarters. The election is about to be decided between him and Shavar Jeffries. Right now we know that about half of precincts have reported and Baraka's up. The mood is very confident. And what people are telling us here over and over again is that this election is a campaign on the future of public employee unions and public schools in this city.

BOB BRAUN, BOBBRAUNSLEDGER.COM: Well, if Baraka wins, I think it's obviously going to be a much needed boost to the Teacher's Union that has had some rough times in the last couple of years. If it loses, I've got to tell you, I think public employee unionism will have taken a serious, serious blow, I mean, you know, right up there with Scott Walker in Wisconsin.

RAS BARAKA SUPPORTER: He's up by--.

BLUMENTHAL: By about six points, with about 120 out of 162.

RAS BARAKA SUPPORTER: Yeah.

BLUMENTHAL: That's pretty good.

RAS BARAKA SUPPORTER: Because just like Wisconsin, in New Jersey civil rights, labor rights are under attack, and today, labor and the community fought back and we won.

RAS BARAKA, MAYOR ELECT, NEWARK, NJ: Today we told them all over the state of New Jersey that the people of Newark are not for sale, that people outweigh money in a democracy all the time, that in a democracy the people should be more important than money, and that Broad Street should be more important than Wall Street.

BLUMENTHAL: As soon as his victory speech was over, Baraka led his supporters on a dramatic march down Newark's Broad Street to City Hall.

RAS BARAKA SUPPORTER: [incompr.] we become mayor. We are the people. We become mayor.

RAS BARAKA SUPPORTER: [incompr.] excited with our new mayor.

RAS BARAKA SUPPORTER: Number one, I was behind Ras Baraka since 2010.

BLUMENTHAL: The victory parade has reached City Hall in downtown Newark, pouring out of the election victory party of Ras Baraka, the newly elected mayor of New Jersey's largest city, Newark. It is now day one of the Baraka administration.
