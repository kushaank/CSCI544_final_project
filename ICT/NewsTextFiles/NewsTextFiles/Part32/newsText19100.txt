
KUALA LUMPUR: National Unity Consultative Council (NUCC) plans to present to the prime minister by this July, a Preliminary Report based on the findings of the Unity Dialogue and a status report of the progress made towards the formulation of the National Unity Blue Print.

Its deputy chairman Tan Sri Lee Lam Thye said NUCC has successfully conducted 18 Unity Dialogue sessions nationwide since it was established five months ago.

“Out of the total 5,530 participants, 1,159 of them gave their comments in writing by filling the questionaire distributed and 512 people spoke up during the dialogues.

“The objective was to hear the voices of the grassroots as ordinary citizens in town hall type meetings,” he said in a statement here yesterday.

According to the statement, NUCC met as a full council for the third time on Saturday chaired by Tan Sri Samsudin Osman.

“At this meeting we took stock of the work accomplished so far by the council since Nov 25, 2013 when Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak launched NUCC.

“In addition we also set the agenda for the next six months,” he said.

“It is not just about the finish project but equally important is the consultive and participatory process,” he said.
