Tom Carper (D-Del.), Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) and senior member of the Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee,  introduced an amendment to the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness (ESIC) Act that would revise the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to categorize geothermal and other thermal sources of energy as renewable.

“I am pleased to work with Sen. Carper on this common sense, bipartisan amendment that will allow the federal government to meet its renewable energy quota by utilizing cost-effective geothermal energy,” said Inhofe. “The multiple benefits of geothermal are undeniable and in demand, but the Energy Policy Act of 2005 failed to classify it as renewable because it does not create new energy. This amendment makes an important, cost-free correction to the law."

Current federal purchase requirement of renewable energy limit safe, cost-effective energy production by excluding geothermal and other thermal sources. Amendment no. 2989 would encourage further development of America’s domestic energy capabilities by modifying the Energy Policy Act of 2005’s definition of renewable energy to include geothermal production.
