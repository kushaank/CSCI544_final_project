
Seward County plans to build a new fire station in Kismet on a vacant lot, replacing the current south station, which has been deemed no longer suitable for a fire department.

The county’s fire department is looking to send out a request for bids from general contractors for a structure to be located on property at 504 Locust in Kismet.

The new fire station will have an engine room with three back in bays, two restrooms, a meeting room and a maintenance/mechanical area.

Standard said the desired building would be constructed with steel and be 66 feet by 86 feet with 14-foot sidewalls. The meeting room would be 38 feet by 26 feet with 10 foot by 11 foot restrooms connected to the meeting room via a hallway.

“The front of the building will face east and will have 30-foot aprons/approaches the width of the building,” Standard said.

Seward County commissioners are scheduled to hear from Standard about the request, and the bid packet further details items such as building materials and who will be responsible for things like building plans.

The packet likewise stated bids for the project must be received by 2 p.m. July 1. Contractors are asked to seal bids in an envelope labeled “Bid for New Seward County Fire Station” and delivered to the Seward County Clerk’s office.
