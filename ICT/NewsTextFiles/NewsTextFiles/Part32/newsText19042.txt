
In a position paper, the Philippine Constitution Association (Philconsa) also pointed out some provisions in the agreement required amending the 1986 Constitution to make it valid contrary to claims of the government.

The agreement called for the establishment of a new Bangsamoro political entity to be carved out initially from the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) composed of the provinces of Maguindanao, Lanao de Sur, Sulu, Basilan and Tawi-Tawi as well as Marawi City.

But Philconsa questioned as an example a provision for the gradual phasing and transfer of law enforcement functions from the Armed Forces of the Philippines to the police force of the Bangsamoro.

The same was true with the revenue-sharing agreement between the government and the MILF whose legality has been questioned by the Philconsa.

Philconsa argued that under the Constitution, all lands of public domain, waters, minerals like coal and petroleum, fisheries, forests, timber, wildlife and other natural resources are owned by the state.

“For Bangsamoro to share, it must be provided in the Constitution or the Constitution authorises the sharing as provided by law but certainly not through an agreement between the executive department and the MILF,” Philconsa pointed out.

The government peace panel, however, has assured that the historic accord known officially as the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro would be within the ambit of the Constitution and as such would not need Charter change or Cha-cha.

In line with the agreement, Aquino set up a 15-member Transition Commission headed by the MILF mandated mainly to draft a proposed law establishing the new Bangsamoro political entity for submission to the Senate and the House of Representatives.

The commission announced it already submitted the proposed law to Aquino for review before submitting it to the Senate and the House as an urgent legislative measure of the administration.
