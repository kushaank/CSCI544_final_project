
Successful legal action by independent political party Mojacar Positiva se Mueve has prevented the controversial award of bonuses to all Mojacar town hall staff that was proposed by the lady major of Mojacar Rosa Maria Cano and agreed at the town’s council meeting on 14 March 2014.

The party, led by councillor Jessica Simpson, filed a legal claim against the proposal claiming that the granting of the bonuses of €1000 to full time workers and €500 to part time workers was clearly illegal. The claim was upheld at an extraordinary urgent council meeting held on Friday 16 May.

A jubilant Simpson said: “We could not have wished for a better outcome. This wholly inappropriate gesture has rightly been slapped down because of its illegality. Importantly, the decision should also be considered against the backdrop of an overriding obligation to be prudent with public funds. Mojacar is not an exception to this obligation.

MPSM’s legal claim had caused several tense situations between the party and council workers, Simpson said, and the lady mayor had not hesitated in using the action as a weapon, saying that MPSM was against the welfare improvement of local town hall workers.

After receiving a letter from the delegated general secretary of the national government, the lady mayor accepted that the bonus proposal was now null and void.

Simpson reflected: “This statement is totally outrageous. Knowing that the proposed bonuses were illegal and confirmed as such in the report of their own auditor and the secretary of government, the mayor is still blaming us for having stopped this crime.

In conclusion, Simpson said: “I want to make it clear that it is the mayor’s mistake and not ours and that the mayor has been making workers feel confronted with us because of our legal action. The mayor should not have told the workers that they were going to receive a thousand euros when it was not clear.
