
A bill needs to be passed in parliament – the ‘Party Loyalty Bill’. The bill must ensure that a person elected from one party must remain in the party for at least 10 years so that their performance can be checked. Many candidates change their parties at the end of a government’s tenure.

A member of parliament gets many perks and privileges in terms of salary, development funds, cars, air fare and foreign trips etc. It is important to see how they worked when they had a portfolio and the next job is given in accordance with the performance shown. In many ministries the development funds are wasted. If a parliamentarian changes his party in every election, how will anyone judge his performance? In the last 20 years, many candidates were elected from the same constituency again and again but none of them actually did any kind of work. They just changed their party every election in order to keep winning the seat in the assembly.
