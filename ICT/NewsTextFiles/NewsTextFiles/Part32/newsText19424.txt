(KCPW News) A Utah Federal District judge says the state of Utah must offer full recognition to the same-sex couples that managed to obtain Utah marriage licenses. However, Judge Dale Kimball has given the state 21 days to obtain an emergency stay.

Defendants State of Utah, Governor Gary Herbert and Attorney General Sean Reyes are prohibited from applying Utah’s marriage bans retroactively to the same-sex marriages that were entered pursuant to Utah marriage licenses issued and solemnized between December 20, 2013, and January 6, 2014. Accordingly, Defendants State of Utah, Governor Gary Herbert and Attorney General Sean Reyes shall immediately recognize the marriages by same-sex couples entered pursuant to Utah marriage licenses issued and solemnized between December 20, 2013, and January 6, 2014, and afford these same-sex marriages all the protections, benefits, and responsibilities given to all marriages under Utah law.

Judge Kimball, however, does not grant same-sex marriages “all protections, benefits, and responsibilities” with immediate effect. Instead, the state will have 21 days to obtain an emergency stay from the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals as they work on the broader same sex marriage case, Kitchen v. Herbert. After those 21 days, and if the Circuit Court still hasn’t ruled on Kitchen v. Herbert, Utah will be required by a Federal court to treat over 1,300 same-sex marriages like any other marriages in the state.

Both the Governor’s office and the Attorney General’s office released statements later on Monday in regards to Judge Kimball’s injunction. The Governor’s office says it is still reviewing the decision and weighing its options for how to proceed.
