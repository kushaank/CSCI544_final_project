
KADUNA - Governor. Mukhtar Yero of Kaduna State  directed the ministries of Works, Land and Education to interven in resolving the recent crisis in Kachia following a trespass on a Muslims’ prayer ground.

Yero gave the directive during a visit to the town after the crisis which led to loss of lives and property on Sunday.

The governor pleaded with people in the affected area to forgive each other and continue to live in peace.

“Kachia is known for peace, and is the least of areas expected to witness such crisis.
