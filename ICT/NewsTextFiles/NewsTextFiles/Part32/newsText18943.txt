
HOWRAH: Ramakrishna Math and Mission authorities will send a message of best wishes and blessings to India's next Prime Minister Narendra Modi after he is sworn in.

Subiranandaji Maharaj, assistant secretary of Ramakrishna Math and Mission, told TOI on Monday that a message from the RKM Belur Math headquarters blessing the new Prime Minister will be sent to Modi immediately after he is sworn in. "A letter will be sent to the new Prime Minister wishing him success," Subiranandaji said.

In the mid-'60s, when RKM's present president maharaj Swami Atmasthanandaji was chief of the mission's Rajkot centre in Gujarat, Modi had met him and expressed a desire to join RKM as a monk. But Atmasthanandaji had told Modi that was not his path and advised him to follow Swamiji's teachings in his life. The Swami had also forecast that one day Modi would serve the country in another field.

Narendra Modi visited Belur Math on April 9 last year. He spent a long time with Swami Atmasthanandaji Maharaj. The two are said to have had a spiritual conversation. Modi paid his respects to the president maharaj and was blessed. Modi was greeted by monks of RKM with prasadi shawl, flowers and prasad.

and gave him valuable advice that helped him take the right decision at crucial times in his life. Modi told monks and the president maharaj that he always carried Swami Vivekananda's karmayoga and rajyoga besides following Swamiji's advice and lessons. Subiranandaji described Modi as a great devotee and follower of Ramakrishna, Sarada Ma and Swami Vivekananda. He also said Modi had a great devotion for the present RKM president maharaj.
