New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez was in town Saturday for a special celebration at the Voier's park Pavilion located on North Country Club Road. Approximately 200 were in attendance for Deming Motor Vehicle Division Appreciation Day to recognize MVD staff there for implementing several positive and proactive operational changes that have lowered wait times and improved overall customer service and satisfaction.

"The staff at Deming MVD has been able to reduce its customer wait times from in excess of 25 minutes or more to just over 10 minutes in the past year — all on a flat budget," said Governor Martinez. "This was accomplished by implementing innovative management practices that focused on operational efficiency and improving customer service. It's important to demonstrate that governmental agencies can work smarter and more quickly with existing resources, and we're doing exactly that one MVD office at a time."

• The Deming office changed their office hours from 7:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. to prevent bottleneck from occurring in the morning;

• Agents streamlined their processes and have assigned each agent a specific category. The Deming office implemented New Mexico Works and TANF volunteers to assist with photos. The additional support staff has assisted the office in lowering wait times; and,

• The office implemented an Information/Greet station. The manager has taken on an active role in directing the flow of the customers and holding her agents accountable for transaction time.

• Average wait times statewide have been reduced from more than 30 minutes to about 17 minutes —w ith 50-75 percent of MVD offices having a wait time lower than 15 minutes;

• With the deployment of the country's first MVD customer satisfaction capture and tracking system, more than 40,000 New Mexicans each month are able to rate the service that they received at the MVD in real-time. More than 98 percent of customers in MVD field offices rate the service they received as "good" to "excellent" — up from 60 percent in 2010; and,

• MVD customer complaints related to "poor" service only amount to 50-60 out of 2.5 million annual transactions per year — this is well below 1/100th of one percent.

City officials, including Deming Mayor Benn Jasso were on hand for the celebration. Guests were treated to food and refreshments, courtesy of Oly and Juan of the La Fonda Restaurant.
