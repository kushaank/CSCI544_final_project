
Srinagar, May 19: With political uncertainty prevailing in the state after the election debacle of National Conference-Congress coalition, the authorities are rushing to prepare annual plan for 2014-15 to seek its timely approval from Government of India.

The planning and development department has sought proposals from all the concerned district officers and departments by May 20 to seek the completion of draft plan within shortest possible time.

Asserting that the plan would be tentative, official sources said the state has to wait till the new government is formed in New Delhi by Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) and understand its attitude towards the state.

“Traditionally with the change in government at Centre, the plans and priorities often change. So we are expecting a change also this time since the five year plan was formulated by United Progressive Alliance (UPA) led by Congress. Only after the communication with new government, the actual plan would be formulated,” said the officials.

In its tentative plan, the state government has asked the officials to prepare the total plan outlay of upto Rs 11900 crore including state plan, centrally sponsored schemes and Prime Minister Reconstruction Program (PMRP).

“The state government is now required to prepare a draft plan document for the current fiscal year consisting all the three items for submission to the Planning Commission,” reads the circular issued by planning department.

However, the department has issued strict restrictions over the authorities for including new schemes in the plan owing to acute shortage of funds. The plan has already been sliced by PCI last year to Rs 700 crores due to financial inefficiency exhibited by the state government.

It has also retained the previous year’s figure for the Revenue components.

“No new works shall be taken in the plan unless there are sufficient funds of at least upto 20 per cent of the estimated cost that too after providing the required amount for ongoing schemes and projects,” the official communication reads.

In a step forward to reduce the financial liabilities, all the financial commitments made by Chief Minister and Planning and Development Department would be accommodated in it with no more additional provisions.

Sources, however, said the state would be facing a major financial crunch this year as it had managed to secure the state plan outlay of Rs 7300 crores only against the required Rs 8300 crores. During this year, the financial debacle of the state was witnessed after it failed to receive funds under Special Plan assistance as per the commitment.

When we won I was shocked and said, 'someone pinch me.' Junaid turned around and asked, 'but kaptaan, we win, why you want punch?'
