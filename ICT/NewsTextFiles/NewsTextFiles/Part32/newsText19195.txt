
NEW YORK—Mayor Bill de Blasio criticized the New York Daily News and the New York Post for casting his wife, Chirlane McCray, in a negative light.

The tabloid articles were based on an interview in New York magazine released online on Sunday. McCray discussed the hardships of balancing her work and her duties as a mother in New York City. In the interview, she says that she did not immediately embrace motherhood and did not want to spend every day with her daughter, Chiara.

The mayor said that the tabloid’s comments are offensive to women in New York City and that they should apologize to McCray and their readers.
