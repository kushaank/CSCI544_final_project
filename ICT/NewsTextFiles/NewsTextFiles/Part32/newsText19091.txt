
Italy's anti-trust and competition authority has launched an investigation to determine whether the commercial practices of online travel websites Booking.com and Expedia are limiting price competition. The decision to place Booking.com and Expedia under investigation was taken at a 07 May meeting of the regulator after concerns were raised by the Italian hotels association Federalberghi, the Italian financial police and the Italian Association for Computers and Automated Calculation (AICA). In February Federalberghi filed a complaint accusing the sites of hindering competition by imposing unfair contract terms on hotels. The regulator said it would be looking into whether "the online travel agencies Booking and Expedia limit price competition through agreements with hotels that condition pricing through other sales channels (including the hotels' own websites), preventing consumers from finding the best offers available". The investigation will be concluded by 30 July 2015, said the regulator in a statement.
