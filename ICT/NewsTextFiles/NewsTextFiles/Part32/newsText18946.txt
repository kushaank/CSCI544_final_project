
A minute's silence will be held at tomorrow's Royal Borough council meeting - as members remember much-loved colleague Cllr Cynthia Endacott who died on Friday.

Cllr Endacott had represented Clewer North ward since May, 1995 as an Independent member. She was Deputy Mayor of Windsor and Maidenhead from 1997 to 1998 and cabinet member for social services from 2000 to 2003.

She served on many council panels and outside organisations including the Berkshire Community Foundation, Clewer Non-Ecclesiastical Charity, Manor Youth Club as chairman and Homer First School as governor.

Cllr Andrew Jenner, Mayor of Windsor and Maidenhead, said he was deeply saddened to learn of the death of a dedicated and charming colleague.

He said: “What shone through to me was Cynthia’s dedication as a councillor and to her residents. She was a great friend and I enjoyed her company, especially when we worked together on the cabinet in 2003.

Cllr Endacott is survived by her husband John, two grown-up children as well as grandchildren. A civic funeral will take place at Windsor Parish Church, High Street, on Wednesday, May 28 at noon.
