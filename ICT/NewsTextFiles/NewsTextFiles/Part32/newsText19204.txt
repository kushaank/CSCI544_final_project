
NEW YORK (AP) - Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration will ask for $40 million in state funds to help fight homelessness in New York City.

The number of people living on the streets of the nation's largest city has dramatically increased in recent years. City officials say that more than 53,000 people -- including 23,000 children -- are currently homeless.

The center of the administration's plan is a new rental assistance program that would cost $80 million over four years. De Blasio's team wants half of that money to come from the state government. Gov. Andrew Cuomo's team has not yet signed off on the plan.

De Blasio has made fighting homelessness a priority of his first year in office. His administration is outlining his plan Monday in a City Council budget hearing.

Airline passengers have come to expect a tiny escape from the confined space of today's packed planes: the ability to recline their seat a few inches. When one passenger was denied that bit of personal space Sunday, it led to a heated argument and the unscheduled landing of their plane, just halfway to its destination.
