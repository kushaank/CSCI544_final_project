
Kenya: All common cadre staff serving in various government ministries will, starting July 1, 2014, report directly to their respective Cabinet Secretaries.

This follows the recently launched policy on Decentralisation of Human Resource Management that will see an overhaul in the functioning of human resource departments in various ministries.

Public Service Commission (PSC) Chairperson Margaret Kobia said lack of control by cabinet secretaries over staff, increased inefficiency and dual reporting relationship in support functions prompted the overhaul in the human resource department.

“We have had cases where a member of staff working under a certain ministry is required to report to a different cabinet secretary depending on their job description. The new policy will ensure that we have staff directly answerable to their ministry CS,” Kobia said.

Kobia explained that the new policy will ensure that employees are more focused in their respective designations thus boosting performance.

The PSC chair said the new organisational structure for ministries will be based on strategic plans mandate of the respective ministries adding that it will reduce workload for the CSs and other senior ministry staff.

“Cabinet secretaries at times leave a gap especially when they have to travel outside the country for work-related issues. However, if they can surround themselves with people who say belong to this ministry and I report to this CS then their job will be almost purely delegating duties,” Kobia explained.

With the new structure, Kobia said, there might be reshuffling of employees in various ministries to ensure they are well-placed in line with their strengths and ability to deliver.
