Attorney General Eric Holder says their victims were Alcoa World Alumina, Westinghouse Electric Co., Allegheny Technologies, U.S. Steel Corp. United Steelworkers Union, and SolarWorld. The indictment also includes allegations of economic espionage and trade secret theft.

A United States official says the Just Department is about to announce criminal charges in a worldwide cyber-espionage case.

Attorney General Eric Holder, along with out federal law enforcement officials, are expected to announce new indictments Monday. The official says those indictments accuse individuals of committing cyber-espionage on behalf of a foreign government. The official added that the prosecution would be first of its kind.

The new head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, John Carlin, has said the prosecution of state-sponsored cyber threats is one of the goals of the Obama administration.
