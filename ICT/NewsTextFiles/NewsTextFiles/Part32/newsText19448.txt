
Continuing their protest against the government, demonstrators of the Young Doctors Association (YDA) blocked GT Road near Sher Shah Suri Bridge on Monday for over an hour, bringing traffic to a standstill.

The association has been demanding a service structure for doctors and has been protesting for the last five days.

Addressing the protesters, YDA President Alamgir Khan said if the government does not accept their demands, doctors from across the province will take to the streets and block major roads.

No government official has visited the protesting doctors since they set up their hunger strike camp near Sher Shah Suri Bridge.

The blockade of the road caused massive traffic jam in the area which is usually congested because of the ongoing construction of an overhead bridge. Traffic had to be diverted to alternate routes to prevent further traffic problems.

“Gridlocks are common near the bridge on Mondays, which is why blockades cause even more disturbance,” said a traffic police warden. He added they could not remove protesters so instead they diverted the traffic.
