Sixteen fire firefighters from three Prince George Fire Rescue halls responded to the 1900 block of Spruce Street around 10 p.m. where crews found a couch fuelling the flames engulfing a second-storey balcony.

Damage was limited to the balcony and exterior of the home. The fire is believed to have been deliberate and the investigation has been turned over the to RCMP.
