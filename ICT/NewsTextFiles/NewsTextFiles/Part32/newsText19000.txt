
With rumour mills fuelled by real estate firms going hog over Acharya Nagarjuna University status in the coming days, academicians and non-teaching staff are rallying together in decrying these rumours.

Over the last two days, reports that ANU could house Camp Office of new Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh or even a secretariat have flooded news channels.

On Monday, Vice-Chancellor K. Viyanna Rao dismissed the rumours and categorically said that there was no proposal from any one to allot a block or a group of buildings for any administrative purpose.

The ANU is looking forward to yet another academic year with classes starting from June. With the addition of professional colleges in engineering and pharmacy, the university is looking to explore new possibilities in academics and research programmes.

The ANU has made use of UGC grants and pooled in resources to construct new blocks for the benefit of students and research scholars and in the future, the ANU would continue to be a centre of excellence in academics.
