
South Korean President Park Geun-hye announced plans to disband the Coast Guard in the wake of the ferry disaster that claimed nearly 300 lives.

During a live address on national television, Park stated that the Coast Guard’s inadequate rescue training contributed to the poor response when the Sewol passenger ferry sank April 16. Eighteen bodies are still missing in the accident, which killed many high school students taking a field trip.

With a lack of faith in the Coast Guard’s ability to respond, Park said the institution would be shut down and its responsibilities transferred to the National Police Agency. The newly created Ministry of National Safety will take charge of marine rescue and security.

Families of the missing and dead, who have been critical of the government’s slow response and handling of the disaster, were shocked by the decision and feared it would delay the investigations to find the missing victims.
