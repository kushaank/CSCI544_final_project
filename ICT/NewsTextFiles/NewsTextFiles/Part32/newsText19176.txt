
Hess Corporation (NYSE:HES) was joined today by Governor Jack Dalrymple,        Senator John Hoeven and a host of other government officials to        commemorate the recently completed expansion of the Tioga Gas Plant,        which more than doubles the operational capacity of the facility.

The project is part of a more than $1.5 billion infrastructure        investment made by Hess between 2012 and 2014 in North Dakota that has        significantly increased production of propane, methane, butane and        natural gasoline, and of ethane, a vital industrial product never before        produced in the state. The expansion also brings a substantial        improvement in efficiency and significantly reduces the amount of        natural gas flared at Hess’s operations, from about 25 percent before        the plant was shut down for the expansion project to 15 to 20 percent        today.

The plant is fully operational and is currently processing about 120        million standard cubic feet of gas per day (MMSCFD), with the        expectation that through the combination of Hess and third-party gas it        will soon process at least 250 MMSCFD with the potential to increase        beyond 300 MMSCFD. Prior to expansion, the plant processed about 100        MMSCFD.

“The legacy of Hess in North Dakota is inseparable from the story of our        booming economy. This expansion grows our portfolio of hydrocarbon and        natural gas exports while reducing flaring, continuing their rich        tradition of responsibly developing our state’s energy capabilities,”        said Congressman Kevin Cramer.

Hess Corporation has a world-class acreage position, with 640,000 net        acres in the Bakken. The company’s full year 2014 production forecast        for the Bakken is 80,000 to 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.        The gas plant expansion, as well as other recent infrastructure        improvements made in North Dakota, is part of the company’s growth        strategy.

Hill was proud to credit employees for the successful expansion project.        “Our successes here are made possible by the incredibly talented        employees and contractors we have in place, who have worked tirelessly        to bring this plant online safely,” Hill said.

At the peak of plant expansion, there were about 1,400 people working at        the site, with more than 5 million total man-hours accumulated over        about a 2 1/2 year period. During the final 9 months to complete the        project and commission the plant, these crews worked 2.3 million man        hours without a single recordable injury.
