
WESTPORT — Fire Chief Brian Legendre was in an accident Sunday night and is in an intensive care unit at Rhode Island Hospital, selectmen reported on Monday.

Selectmen Chairman Antone Vieira Jr. said after Monday's meeting that Legendre's accident occurred at his home and an ambulance was sent to his home.

Vieira said the board is "fairly certain" the accident involved a fall but did not have any details beyond that.

Deputy Chief Allen Manley Jr. reported this accident to the board on Monday.

Vieira said Legendre is expected to be in the ICU for at least the next few days.

Manley is in charge of the department in Legendre's place.

Selectmen R. Michael Sullivan ended Monday's selectmen meeting by initiating "well-wishes" to both Legendre and town Firefighter Steven Lopes.

Lopes was injured and had been in critical condition after falling from an icy roof while he was battling a house fire in March.

Lopes, who was being treated for traumatic injuries, returned from a rehabilitation center on Saturday and came home. He was greeted by many of his fellow firefighters during his return.
