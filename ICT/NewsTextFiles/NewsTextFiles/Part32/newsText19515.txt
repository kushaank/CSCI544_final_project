
An Indian organisation, specialising in prosthetic legs, will supply artificial limbs free of cost to 1,000 physically-challenged Afghan nationals in the war-torn country.

Jaipur Foot has signed an agreement with the Afghanistan government to supply 1,000 prosthetic legs to terror attack victims and polio sufferers.

“The Indian organisation has agreed to provide the limbs free of cost,” said Amina Afzali, Minister of Work, Social Affairs, Martyred, and Disabled in Afghanistan.

“Jaipur Foot will manufacture limbs for those who have lost their legs to roadside bombings, terrorist attacks or polio,” Afzali was quoted as saying by Pajhwok Afghan News agency.

Afzali hoped the assistance would further consolidate relations between the two countries.

An agreement to the effect was inked between Afzali and DR Mehta, founder and patron-in-chief of Jaipur Foot.

Indian ambassador to Afghanistan, Amar Sinha, said India was committed to continued assistance to Afghanistan.

India has also planned to train staff at the Disabled Technical Institute in Afghanistan to produce artificial limbs themselves.
