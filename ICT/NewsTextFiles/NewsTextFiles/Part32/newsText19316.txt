
Greece’s leftwing Syriza party threw down a challenge to the coalition government in Sunday’s first round of voting in local elections, with a strong showing in polls for the mayor of Athens and the governor of the Attica region.

The neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party also made significant gains in Athens and in western Attica, a distressed industrial area where the jobless rate is close to 70 per cent.

However, government-backed candidates were ahead in nine out of 13 nationwide elections for regional governors.

In the Athens poll, Gabriel Sakellaridis, a 33-year-old economist standing for Syriza, trails incumbent mayor George Kaminis by 1 percentage point, according to near-final results announced by the interior ministry on Monday.
