GAUTIER, Mississippi -- The City of Gautier is using Facebook as a cost-effective way of gauging support for its proposed smoking ban.

The poll has been running for about a month, Mayor Gordon Gollott said Monday, with the votes thus far showing 51 percent in favor of the ban, 46 percent against and 3 percent undecided.

"Should the City of Gautier consider an ordinance to ban smoking in workplaces and public places?"

The poll can be found here .

Gollott acknowledged that non-Gautier residents could vote in the poll and thus skew the numbers.

If approved, smoking would be prohibited in all enclosed public places within Gautier and in all enclosed areas of places of employment, in all private clubs, all private and semi-private rooms in nursing homes and in at least 90 percent of hotel and motel rooms.

In addition, smoking would be prohibited in outdoor places within a reasonable distance of 15-20 feet of outside entrances, exits, operable windows, and ventilation systems. This would also apply to outdoor seating areas of restaurants and bars, outdoor arenas and stadiums, outdoor public transportation stations, all outdoor service lines, and outdoor playgrounds.

Smoking would also be prohibited in outdoor common areas of residential facilities except in designated smoking areas, not to exceed 25 percent of the total common area.

An outline of the proposed ordinance can be found here .

The city held a public hearing on April 15. Gollott said he is unsure if another will be held.

"We're going to take another look at the ordinance and see of we can come up with something that will get us what we want for our community," he said.
