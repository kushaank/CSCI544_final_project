For the second time in two years, the University of Minnesota is fending off accusations that it has one of the most top-heavy administrations in higher education.

The report, by a self-described progressive think tank, accuses the U and other schools of spending lavishly on top executives and administrative staff at the expense of students and faculty.

Eric Kaler , the U’s president, dismissed the report as “dead wrong.” He said the institute, which is based in Washington, D.C., used “incorrect data to reach erroneous results,” and painted a distorted picture of his record as president.

The authors of the report said they analyzed public data to determine which public universities were spending the most on executive salaries and administrative staff.

At the University of Minnesota, they reported, the number of “non academic” administrators tripled between 2010 and 2012, from 762 to 2,384.

They also concluded that, per student, administrative costs have soared while spending on financial aid has dwindled since 2006.

Accusations about administrative waste have dogged the university for several years. In 2012, the Wall Street Journal reported that the University of Minnesota had the largest share of administrative employees among the nation’s 72 top public research universities, and that its administrative ranks had grown by 37 percent since 2001.

The university disputed those findings, saying that it had reported the information incorrectly to the federal database that was used for comparison.

In light of that history, Kaler said, the institute’s report was especially frustrating. “My priorities are to invest in our faculty and in our financial aid, which is exactly what we’ve done,” he said.

The general public’s access to buildings will be reduced, while allowing students, ­faculty and staff some access.
