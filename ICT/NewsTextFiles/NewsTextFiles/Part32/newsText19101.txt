
CAIRO, May 19 (KUNA) -- It is prudent for all Kuwaiti citizens currently in Egypt, both vacationers and students, to stay clear of crowds and places where masses gather for activities in any way related to the upcoming presidential elections in their host state, urged the Kuwaiti Ambassador here Salem Al-Zamanan, Monday.

The diplomat noted this is for the citizens' own safety, adding that any inquiries or requests for help could be communicated to the embassy through the assigned hotlines; (00202357121187), (00202357114101), and (0020235712194).

In his remarks to KUNA on the elections, slated for May 26-27, Al-Zamanan said Egypt is well on the path of constructing a stronger democratic state as pointed out by the roadmap approved by the Egyptian people. This is to be added to the previous successful step of adopting a new constitution back in January, he stressed.

The ambassador also praised the flocking of Egyptians abroad to polling stations in their consulates or embassies, hoping this process helps the Egyptian people realize their goals and aspirations.

Egyptians abroad were to cast ballot for six days ending Monday, May 19. Authorities are now reporting "unprecedented turnout" across 141 ballot committees in 124 countries, amid expressions of optimism by voters.
