
A home in the 100 block of Monarch Drive had to be condemned Monday night after a fire ripped through the two-story residence.

Firefighters were called by several people shortly after 7 p.m. and some reported people might still be inside. Before crews could arrive, two adults tried to get inside to find any occupants, but had to retreat because the smoke and heat was too intense, according to a news release from the Newport News Fire Department. They suffered minor injuries and were treated at the scene.

When crews arrived, they saw heavy fire coming from the front and side windows. Firefighters moved hoses into the home as they began searching the residence. But the fire was moving rapidly into the second floor and the attic, so crews were ordered out of the building. A ladder truck had to spray water at the outside of the house to extinguish the fire.

The fire was under control about 8:15 p.m.

The people who lived at the address were not home at the time of the fire, according to Battalion Chief Stephen C. Pincus, a Fire Department spokesman. They arrived home after firefighters were already on the scene. All three were displaced, and the Red Cross was called to help them.

Today, the Fire Marshal's Office said the fire has been ruled accidental because it was caused by an electrical problem.
