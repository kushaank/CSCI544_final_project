
Following the accusation by the All Progressives Congress (APC) of lack of achievement and performance by the Governor Muazu Babangida Aliyu’s government, the state commissioner of information, communications and strategy, Mallam Danladi Ndayebo has  said that the  opposition must be blind not to notice  Aliyu’s achievements.

Ndayebo said in a statement reacting to APC declarations on the state of affairs in the state, that the opposition party was callous and resentful.

The statement advised APC to criticise the government constructively rather than engaging in cheap shots and meaningless diatribe.

He said opposition elements in the state should join hands with the PDP in moving the state forward.

On the criticism of the recent cabinet reshuffle by the PDP government, Ndayebo said the criticism should be disregarded while describing the allegations by the opposition as not only false and baseless but callous.

Ndayebo described the party’s statement as “careless, provocative and contemptuous”.

The statement wondered why the APC would want to cast aspersions on the integrity of the PDP led government in the state over a cabinet reshuffle that was carried out to reposition the executive council for optimal performance.

According to him “For the avoidance of doubt, the decision to re-jig the composition of the executive council was premised on the need to reposition the cabinet for efficiency and effectiveness anchored on the state’s vision to become one of the top three most developed state economies in the country”.
