
KARACHI: Senior PML-N leader Irfanullah Marwat on Monday lashed out at his party chief Nawaz Sharif, saying that he hasn’t learnt anything from his past experiences.

Marwat, who is PML-N’s parliamentary leader in Sindh Assembly, said that he was being punished for winning from Sindh.

“We are neither seeking governorship nor any ministry. We only want respect from the party leadership,” the infuriated PML-N lawmaker said.

He said that he was not going to make any forward block. “What is our fault if we are not Kashmiri,” he questioned.
