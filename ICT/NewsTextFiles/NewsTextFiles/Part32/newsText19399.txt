
MADISON, Wis (WSAU-Wheeler News) Â A federal court trial is scheduled to begin a week from tomorrow to decide whether a Wisconsin abortion law is constitutional. Judge William Conley of Madison will determine whether abortion doctors should be required to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. The state's Republican majority approved the law a year ago, saying it would provide consistent care should a woman suffer complications from an abortion.

Plaintiffs say it's almost impossible for their abortion doctors to get hospital admitting privileges -- and therefore, the law would effectively shut down abortion clinics in Appleton and Milwaukee.

Planned Parenthood and Affiliated Medical Services filed the lawsuit just hours after Governor Scott Walker signed the law last summer.
