
The Telangana Rashtra Samithi has said that it will not tolerate undue influence of Telugu Desam on the BJP with the aim to tinker with the bifurcation law and make Hyderabad a permanent joint capital or a Union territory.

Politburo member of the party Nayani Narasimha Reddy told The Hindu that the TRS had nothing against the growing relationship between TDP and BJP but there would be a serious backlash if the two parties worked to alter the status of Hyderabad. He denied that there was any discussion in the party about the TDP-BJP camaraderie.

Karimnagar Member of Parliament B. Vinod Kumar sought to know why the TDP will bargain for Hyderabad when it wants to build the capital for Andhra Pradesh on a much bigger scale. He felt the TDP was focused on seeing to it that Hyderabad was nowhere near the capital of Andhra Pradesh.

That he saw no threat of amendments to bifurcation law was made clear by TRS president K. Chandrasekhar Rao recently at a press conference. He had asked, “how can the Centre do it?” His daughter and Nizamabad MP K. Kavitha was more vocal saying “we will fight tooth and nail if anything like that happened”. She reminded that the TRS had 11 MPs.

However, Telangana Joint Action Committee chairman M. Kodandaram expressed concern whether the BJP will bow to pressure from the TDP and ignore the requirements of Telangana. He said the alliance between the two parties should not come in the way of Telangana. The Centre should not display any partiality, he suggested.
