
China's housing price slump has spread to first-tier cities. Beijing, a representative of the trend, saw a mere 7,616 housing units sold in April, the lowest in nearly 11 months.

While housing transactions drop, land transactions continue to sizzle.

A real estate study showed that land transactions in 10 cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen totaled 340.3 billion yuan (US$54.64 billion) during the first four months, up 81.1% from the same period last year or up 330.6% from the same period in 2012 and setting a new high.

Among them, land transactions in Beijing alone totaled a record high of 105.6 billion yuan (US$16.95 billion) as of the end of April, up 92% from the same period last year and accounting for 58% of the whole of 2013.

"This has been a new issue in the current real estate market, with excess housing stockpiling in third and fourth-tier cities while land prices climb in first-tier cities. The problem of how to absorb high land prices has come to the forefront," said Chen Guoqiang, vice president of China Real Estate Industry Association.

Local governments are considered one of the factors contributing towards high land prices, a consulting firm manager in Beijing said. "Land transactions account for a lot of financial revenue for local governments and is a major channel for ensuring local government investment in GDP growth," Jin Yongxiang said.

Ministry of Finance data show that during the first quarter of the year, land transaction revenues touched 1.08 trillion yuan (US$173 billion), up 40.3% from the same period last year.
