
While Tallinn City Government’s plans to open a municipal bank seem like an Edgar Savisaar’s dream that will never come true, another initiative – opening the first municipal grocery discounter – is taking shape.

On Wednesday, City Government will open its first city-funded discounter in Lasnamäe at Punane street.

The store which is called LIPO (short for linnapood, or municipal store) is managed by Tallinna Turud that also manages municipal open-air food markets in Nõmme and Mustamäe as well as the fish market and flower market.

Deputy Mayor of Tallinn Arvo Sarapuu said that at present the city is mapping food prices in other grocery chains and plans to offer its products at 10-15 percent cheaper.

Sarapuu said that the store will guarantee that prices of 30 food items and 4 primary consumer goods will be 10 to 15 percent cheaper than elsewhere.

One special feature with LIPO is that it will have over-the-counter sale instead of self-service. The store will have 8 sales assistants.

It's very inefficient from a labor standpoint, but maybe that's their goal -- to employ lots of sales assistants.
