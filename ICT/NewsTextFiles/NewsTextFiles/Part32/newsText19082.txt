
Final preparations are underway in Manitoba for the Royal visit.

Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, make their way to Winnipeg Tuesday night where they will attend a reception at Government House.

Dwight Macaulay, chief protocol officer for Manitoba, says staff are doing last-minute work on the grounds of the Manitoba legislature where the couple will do a walkabout the following evening.

That's where Royal watchers will get their best chance to see the couple, just before 8 p.m., he said.

"I certainly hope there will be a lot of people coming out to welcome them," Macaulay said. "Keep in mind, Prince Charles is going to be the King of Canada one day and the leader of the Commonwealth. This is a great chance for the people to come out and see their future king."

The last time Prince Charles visited Manitoba was in 1996 and this visit will have a familiar feeling.

Back then, the prince made a stop in Churchill, where he took part in the opening of Wapusk National Park, which has one of the world's largest known polar bear maternity denning areas.

"And now on this visit, ironically enough, he's going to be visiting the Assiniboine Zoo where he'll be one of the first guests to look at a new facility called Journey to Churchill. It's kind of ironic but very fitting,” Macaulay said.
