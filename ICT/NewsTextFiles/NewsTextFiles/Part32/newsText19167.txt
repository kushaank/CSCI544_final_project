
StockMarketWire.com - Dixons Retail has agreed to sell its ElectroWorld operations in central Europe to NAY a.s., a leading electrical specialist retailer in the region.   Electroworld operates 26 specialist electrical retail stores across Czech Republic and Slovakia.   Following completion, which is expected to take place during the summer, and which remains subject to certain normal conditions including competition authority clearance, Dixons Retail expects to receive a small deferred cash consideration spread over three years.

For the year to April, the assets being disposed of generated losses before tax of £5.6m on turnover of £129m from 26 stores, including two franchise stores.   CDixons Retail group chief executive Sebastian James said: "I am very pleased that we have been able to secure a strong future for Electroworld who will be able to flourish as a part of the NAY Group in Central Europe. Following this transaction Dixons will be a market leader in every market in which it operates, delivering on one of our key strategic objectives."
