
(ANSAmed) - LISBON, MAY 19 - Portugal officially exited on Monday the bailout programme drafted by the Troika (EU-ECB-IMF) under which it obtained in 2011 a loan worth 79 billion euros provided it implemented a number of austerity measures to cut expenditure.

Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho announced the country will ''not seek further security measures, although the road ahead is still long to get out of the crisis''.

The premier added that ''the government's priorities are economic and employment recovery''.

Meanwhile European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso was quoted as saying by the media that the fact that Portugal would not be demanding further support ''represents a success both for Lisbon and the European Union''.

In order to reach the objective imposed by the troika, the conservative government implemented a number of austerity measures - which were slammed by opposition parties, unions, associations and even the army - with drastic cuts to public jobs and salaries and an increase in working hours as well as the sale of public firms.

Portugal's public debt is worth 130% of GDP, the unemployment rate dropped to 15.3% from 18% but remains one of the highest in Europe. However the government has forecast a 1.2% growth in 2014 after a 1.4% recession last year.(ANSAmed).
