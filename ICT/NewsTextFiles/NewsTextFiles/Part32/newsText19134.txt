
Patna: Despite being re-elected as Bihar Chief Minister by the Janata Dal-United (JD-U) Legislature, Nitish Kumar refused to withdraw his resignation on Monday. However, he will be deciding on who will occupy the CM’s throne in the state.

JD-U spokesperson Sanjay Singh informed reporters that when MLAs forced his to withdraw his resignation and even threatened him to sit on dharna at his residence, he asked for one-day time to re-think on his decision.

However, the party MLAs have been called for another meeting on the issue tomorrow, added Singh.

During his address, Nitish Kumar said that his re-election as Bihar Chief Minister would diminish party’s reputation and insisted party members not to force him to withdraw his resignation.

He also stated that now he will be able to devote more time to party remaining out of power. He condemned the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for taking jibe at his resignation by terming it as ‘nautanki’ (drama). However, JD-U leaders completely rubbished the allegations.

Earlier, senior Minister Narendra Singh suggested Nitish Kumar’s name for the chief minister’s throne and all the assembly members supported the decision, stated MLA Ashok Kumar.

Meanwhile, none other leader’s name was recommended for the post, though, it is being speculated that Nitish Kumar may elevate RCP Singh as Bihar’s new chief minister as he is a very close aide to the ex-CM.
