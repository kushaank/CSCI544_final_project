
New Delhi :  Narendra Modi, prime-minister-to-be, and BJP president Rajnath Singh are holding separate consultations in different parts of Delhi to finalise the new BJP-led cabinet. Senior BJP leader Sushma Swaraj met Mr Singh at his residence and has now reached Gujarat Bhawan where Mr Modi is.

Ms Swaraj waited for a while as former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh finished his meeting with Rajnath Singh. He soon drove up at Gujarat Bhawan to meet Mr Modi.

Mr Advani is reportedly keen to be the Lok Sabha Speaker as that position does not report to the PM.  Ms Swaraj is reportedly keen on taking charge of one of the top four ministries that form the Cabinet Committee on Security - home, defence, external affairs and finance.

Allies are meeting the BJP brass too. Lok Janshakti Party chief Ramvilas Paswan and his son Chirag,  MDMK chief Vaiko and Apna Dal leader Anupriya Patel met Mr Singh today while Naga People's Front leader and Nagaland Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio met Mr Modi yesterday.

The date of the new government's swearing-in has still not been finalised. The newly-elected MPs of the BJP will hold a meeting at 12 noon tomorrow to formally elect Mr Modi as their leader, and as such, the prime ministerial designate of the BJP-led NDA.

Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) spokesperson Ram Madhav and BJP leader Udit Raj were earlier seen leaving the Jhandewalan office of the Sangh. The RSS office had been a hub of much political activity yesterday, when leaders like Venkaiah Naidu, Sushma Swaraj, Kalraj Mishra and Mr Munde paid a visit to the party's ideological mentor and met the Sangh's second-in-command Bhaiyyaji Joshi.
