
HAMMOND | A Lake Station man pleaded guilty Monday to charges involving a 2010 tax fraud scheme in which he inflated customers' income amounts for filing purposes and improperly kept some of their refund money without their knowledge.

Tax preparer Michael Nash pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to defraud the government and aggravated identity theft.

Nash last week entered into a plea agreement with the government that indicated the total loss was between $400,000 and $1 million. In addition to using false information to increase the earned income tax credit to get a larger refund, he also said in the plea agreementÂ  he filed some tax returns without the knowledge of many clients. He claimed he got some of his clients from an unnamed co-conspirator.

U.S. District Court Chief Judge Philip P. Simon accepted the guilty plea Monday, but said he would defer his decision on acceptance of the plea agreement until sentencing. The sentencing in the case is scheduled for Oct. 16.
