
The Taraba Government on Monday said that Dangote Group had paid N1.2 billion to it as compensation for land acquired in Lau Local Government Area of the state.

Alhaji Armayaâ€™u Abubakar, the chairman of the committee set up for the screening and payment of compensation to the land owners, said this in Jalingo during the disbursement of the money in Jalingo.

According to him, a total of 2,500 land owners captured by the committee would be compensated at the end of the exercise.

He, however, said that the disbursement would begin with 300 people on first phase, adding that subsequent payments would continue in phases.

Abubakar said that the committee was always ready to receive complaints and observations from the land owners on possible errors in the screening exercise.

He commended the Lau people for the high sense of maturity they exhibited throughout the screening, assuring them that the disbursement would be through e-payment for easy documentation.

Speaking on behalf of the beneficiaries, Alhaji Tukur Abba Tukur, the Galadima of Muri, expressed gratitude to the state government and Dangote for the compensation.

This is very interesting. My brothers in SS will learn from this: that when your land is being acquired for use for the greater good, show appreciation and not apprehension!
