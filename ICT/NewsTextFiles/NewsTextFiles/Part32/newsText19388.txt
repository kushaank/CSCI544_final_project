
INDIA’S Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, the force of Indian politics for the best part of a century, faces a fight for its survival after an election drubbing at the hands of opposition leader Narendra Modi.

Often described as the country’s answer to a royal family, with the added tragic glamour of the Kennedys, the dynasty gave India its first prime minister, the empire-beating barrister Jawaharlal Nehru. His daughter, Indira Gandhi, and grandson, Rajiv Gandhi, both held the post subsequently, and both were assassinated.

Friday’s electoral humiliation risks consigning the family that has ruled India for most of its 67 years since independence to political oblivion, as Mr Modi — who cast the Gandhis as elitist throughout his campaign — looks to sideline them for good.

By some measures, the family was in decline long before the parliamentary election; it has not won a majority in decades.

But the sheer scale of Mr Modi’s victory this time around, dealing the Gandhis’ Congress party its worst election defeat, underlines how deeply that decay had spread.

"The Congress has done pretty badly, there is a lot for us to think about. As vice-president of the party I hold myself responsible," says Nehru’s great-grandson Rahul Gandhi, who was consistently outshone by Mr Modi on the campaign trail.

Mr Gandhi was flanked by his mother, Rajiv’s widow Sonia, who also delivered a brief concession speech, taking a swipe at Mr Modi’s Hindu nationalist policies that she says are divisive. "We hope the government that will be formed in the centre will not compromise the unity of Indian society and the interests of the country," she said, while also shouldering blame for the debacle.

Mr Gandhi’s bid to keep Congress in power for a third consecutive term was called lacklustre even by allies, and his speeches at rallies up and down the country in recent months were a far cry from Nehru’s legendary rhetoric.

Compare that with Modi’s electrifying campaign, during which he repeatedly derided Mr Gandhi and Ms Gandhi for keeping India poor, and the house of Gandhi looked vulnerable.

Few would write off the clan completely. Ms Gandhi, the power behind the prime ministerial throne occupied by Manmohan Singh, delivered Congress its worst result to date in 1999. She then led the party to victory in the next two elections, and a year ago Forbes ranked her as the world’s ninth-most-powerful woman.

The party faithful — while reeling as partial results on Friday showed Mr Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led in more than six times as many seats as Congress — were quick to rally around the wounded Gandhis.

"Giving up on the Gandhis at this juncture would be the most stupid thing that the Congress could do," former minister and family loyalist Mani Shankar Aiyar says.

For those in the party looking for fresh blood, the search ends with Mr Gandhi’s sister, Priyanka, who had an important backroom role in the campaign. "Party men would embrace her with both arms the moment she wants to join," he says.

Leaders of both Congress and Mr Modi’s BJP say they believed that Mr Modi will seek to loosen the dynasty’s grip on India.

They pointed to his home state of Gujarat, where he has systematically purged rivals from institutions and won three consecutive terms, capitalising on his pro-business policies.

"He will defang them politically. Look at what he did in Gujarat: he has just reduced the Congress to a nonplayer," BJP’s national executive committee member Kanchan Gupta says.

Mr Modi has questioned Ms Gandhi’s non-native roots — the widow of Rajiv Gandhi was born in Italy.

A BJP ally called Mr Gandhi a "foreigner", even though he was born in New Delhi.

Congress sources say they are worried Mr Modi plans to drive the family out of politics.

The scale of his antipathy to the Gandhis was on display at the start of the campaign last year, when he launched the construction of the world’s tallest statue, a $338m, 182m tall homage to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Nehru’s deputy and interior minister, who was often at odds with him.

Mr Modi, a Hindu nationalist, sees Mr Patel as a symbol of an India imagined without the dynasty, who would have led the country down a different, right-wing path if he had not been thwarted by the socialist and atheist Nehru.

The Congress party has lost power several times since Nehru’s era. After his daughter Indira Gandhi led the party to a crushing defeat in 1977, the prime minister who replaced her humiliated the family with arrests and investigations.

Mr Modi is not expected to follow the same course of using tax and police agencies to harass the Gandhis.
