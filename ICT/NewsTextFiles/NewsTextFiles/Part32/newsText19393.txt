
The Congress top leaders are meeting on Monday to review party's worst ever performance in the 16th Lok Sabha polls, where it managed just 44 out of the 543 seats.

The meeting is under way at the party headquarters.

All the members of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) including former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and party's Vice President Rahul Gandhi are present at the meeting.

On Friday after the poll results were declared, Sonia said: "The people have given their verdict against us. As the Congress president, I take the entire responsibility of our defeat."

Moments later, Rahul said: "Congress has done pretty badly. There is a lot of introspection needed. As the party's vice president, I hold myself responsible for the party's defeat."

Decimating the ruling Congress in a landslide victory, Narendra Modi led the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to win 285 seats out of 543 that made it the first party to cross the majority mark of 272 on its own in over 30 years.

Riding on an unprecedented wave of expectations coupled with widespread resentment against the ruling Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA), Modi almost singled-handedly bought the BJP-led National Deocratic Alliance (NDA) to a 340-seat-tally.

Sonia and Rahul Gandhi-led Congress party meanwhile was routed to just 44 seats, a huge 162 seats short of last time, ending Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's tenure with a humiliating blow.
