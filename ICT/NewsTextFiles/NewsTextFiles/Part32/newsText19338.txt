
The Foreign Ministry has called in the police to investigate alleged wrongdoing in the granting of visas by the Maltese consulate in Tripoli.

In a statement, the ministry said it had received several conflicting reports since the Labour government was elected to power in March 2013.

“The ambassador, a senior, experienced diplomat whose integrity was undoubted, had expressed concerns but never filed specific reports or indicated individuals”, the statement said.

The consulate handled hundreds of visa applications every day and worked in difficult circumstances because of the security situation. Ministry officials were involved in several meetings to improve efficiency and transparency in the granting of visas.

Earlier this year a consul in Benghazi who handled visas was urgently recalled to Malta because of threats to his life.

The ministry said it was aware that the police had interviewed the principal officer responsible for the granting of visas at the consulate in Tripoli but it had not spoken to the police or the official about those meetings. Neither was it aware of any charges or any decisions taken by the police.

However, ministry officials were in Tripoli over the past days to collect documents which will be brought to Malta for investigation.

The ministry said it will act according to the findings of its investigations and those of the police.

Why so many visas? What? Are they all coming for holidays. I am really fed up with so many illegal immigrants that since they do not come by sea are never mentioned. Is there some secret agreement with this lawless country? Was it NOT them who told us how Libya would be a truly democratic country without Ghaddafi? How illegal immigrants would be no longer? Lies, lies and more lies.

Maybe somebody is having a problem paying the rent and needs to make some extra money.
