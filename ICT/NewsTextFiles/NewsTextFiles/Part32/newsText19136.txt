
Chandigarh: While talks are being held among the BJP top brass over the composition of the Cabinet in a Narendra Modi-led government, it is yet to be seen whether the party's age-old alliance partner Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) will be considered for it or not.

In 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the SAD won four seats out of the total 13 seats in Punjab. Moreover, it supported the BJP to win two seats from Gurdaspur and Hoshiarpur.

The Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal's daughter-in-law Harsimrat Kaur Badal won the Bhatinda seat for consecutive second time. The party had sought votes on the pretext that if Harsimrat won, she might be a part of Narendra Modi Cabinet.

The BJPâ€™s prime minister-elect Narendra Modi yesterday met senior party leader LK Advani as well as other leaders including from alliance partners as part of consultations aimed at formation of the new NDA government.

However, as the fierce speculation on who will get the top posts in his government are doing the rounds, it would be a matter of concern that who among Shiv Sena, Telugu Desam Party, Shiromani Akali Dal and Lok Janshakti Party, will be selected for Modi's Cabinet.

The BJP parliamentary party meet is scheduled for 11:30 tomorrow. All BJP CMs and senior NDA leaders would be present during the meeting when Modi will be formally declared as the NDA's choice to be the next Prime Minister of India.
