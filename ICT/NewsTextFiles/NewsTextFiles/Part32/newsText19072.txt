
SINGAPORE — Professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs) will be a key group the Government focuses on as it continues with the economic transformation.

To meet the aspirations of about 40,000 to 45,000 young Singaporeans expected to enter the job market each year over the next three years, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said more PMET jobs would be created.

The ministry will work with the Manpower Ministry and the Education Ministry and the industry to prepare Singaporeans for “specialist, managerial and leadership roles” in the economy, it added.

Ministries today (May 19) outlined their policies and initiatives in response to the President’s address last Friday. In a break from tradition — where ministries would individually release their plans — the responses are grouped under themes this time. Today, ministries focused on ensuring the Republic is a “nation of opportunity”.

“A strong economy will create more PMET jobs for Singaporeans. We will equip Singaporeans with the skills to take on a wide range of specialist, managerial and leadership roles. We will strengthen our Continuing Education and Training (CET) system,” the Government said in a statement.

Among its initiatives, the MOM said it would enhance job facilitation efforts for all displaced workers, including PMETS, and improve accessibility to training for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and their workers. The Fair Consideration Framework and Jobs Bank will also be implemented.
