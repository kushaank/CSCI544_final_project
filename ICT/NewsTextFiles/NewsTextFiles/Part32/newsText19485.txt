
The Malden man accused of torching a local multi-family home that resulted in a Saugus firefighter�s injury is being held without bail.

Namit Thapa, 28, entered a "not guilty" plea to charges of arson and disorderly conduct at Malden District Court on May 12. The judge granted the prosecution�s request for pre-trial detention, without bail.

Thapa is accused of starting a three-alarm fire at his residence that injured two firefighters and left seven people homeless on May 9. The injured firefighters were sent to the hospital and later released. No other injuries were reported.

During the arraignment, the prosecution said Thapa was arrested following an interview with Malden police on May 10.

Thapa allegedly told police that he�d been drinking in the house at 63 Converse Ave., had lit some tissues on fire and then fled the scene without notifying the other residents.

Thapa did not speak during the arraignment, but did shake his head several times while the prosecution laid out the case for probable cause.

Speaking earlier in the week, Malden Fire Chief Jack Colangeli described the fire as fast moving and dangerous, saying the entire building was ablaze when firefighters arrived at 5:30 a.m. He said most of the residents were outside the building, but firefighters were sent into the building to search for Thapa, who lived on the third floor and was unaccounted for.

Colangeli said firefighters had to call off that search when the building started to collapse.

"Our initial responders were looking for him," he said. "The roof and the chimney collapsed, so we sent everyone out of the building."

Colangeli said Lt. Keith Buchanan suffered first-degree burns on his face while fighting the fire.

"He stayed until the fire was out, then he went to the hospital," said Colangeli. "That shows you what kind of guy he is."

The other injured firefighter was from Saugus. Speaking Friday afternoon, Saugus Fire Chief Donald McQuaid declined to release the firefighter�s name, but added the injured firefighter was resting comfortably and under observation at Massachuetts General Hospital.

A release from the office of District Attorney Marian Ryan alleged that Thapa intentionally started the fire, adding an anonymous tip aided the investigation.

"During the course of the investigation into the cause of this fire, a tip to Malden police allegedly led them to investigate and subsequently charge this defendant," said the release.

Wicked Local news partner WCVB reported that one of the displaced residents was seven months pregnant.
