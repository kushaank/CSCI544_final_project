
Twenty-nine persons of Venbavur, who complained of diarrhoea, were treated at the Government Hospital at Krishnapuram on Monday.

Since this was sudden and unexpected, residents were gripped with anxiety, and rumours about water or food contamination spread in the area. Official sources said that although 29 persons had complained of diarrhoea, only eight needed clinical intervention. Others were treated and they returned home. The in-patients were administered fluids and their condition was stable.

Meanwhile, officials inspected drinking water source, overhead tanks, and supply pipelines and collected water samples for ascertaining traces of contamination. However, the tests did not confirm any possible contamination.

A mobile medical unit has been deployed at the village.Samples of stools of in-patients have been sent to a laboratory in Chennai for investigation and the results were awaited, according to officials.
