
CHANDIGARH: The  Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday directed the secretary, union ministry of urban development, to intervene and coordinate with the  UT administration and the  Punjab government over the finalisation of the regional development plan for the city and its periphery. The directions were passed after it was informed that the parties were not coordinating with each other.

The administration alleged the regional plan has hit a roadblock because the Punjab government was not cooperating. While directing the secretary of the  union ministry of urban development to intervene, the division bench headed by  chief justice  Sanjay Kishan observed that the states were more interested in commercial exploitation of periphery than the larger issue of preserving Chandigarh's heritage.

The bench also observed that the construction activities in the periphery would be stayed if the parties failed to cooperate with each other. The chief architect also submitted before the court that a report of UT's master plan would be place before the administrator within 10 days.

The matter was pending with the Punjab and Haryana high court in the wake of an ongoing public interest litigation (PIL) filed by one Gurbax Singh Shergill seeking directions to prepare a composite regional plan for the Tricity for the future planning of the periphery of Chandigarh.
