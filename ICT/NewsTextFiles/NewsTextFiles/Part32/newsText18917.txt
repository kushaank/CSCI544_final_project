
ATLANTA (AP) Early voting in the 2014 primaries is up from four years ago, but Georgia's Republican Senate nomination still will be settled by a relatively small slice of the state's 5 million active registered voters and 10 million residents.

The GOP has seven candidates who want to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss. The primary is likely headed to a July 22 runoff.

Secretary of State Brian Kemp says almost 240,000 Georgians cast ballots ahead of Tuesday's primary, including almost 148,000 Republicans. In 2010, almost 213,000 people voted early out of 680,000 total ballots cast.

It's difficult to know whether the early voting increase means an overall turnout bump or simply reflects the campaigns' emphasis on the opportunity to vote early.

Polls will open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.
