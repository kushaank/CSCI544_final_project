
James Dutschke gets 25 years after pleading guilty to posting the poison-laced letters to the president, a senator and a judge.

A man who admitted sending poison-laced letters to President Barack Obama and other officials has been jailed 25 years.

James Everett Dutschke, from Mississippi, pleaded guilty to posting the letters containing ricin to Mr Obama, Senator Roger Wicker and a judge in the city.

The 42-year-old martial arts instructor initially denied the charges, and tried to frame former friend and Elvis impersonator, Paul Kevin Curtis, according to prosecutors.

Dutschke's sentencing was delayed last week after he indicated he wanted to withdraw his plea agreement.

He claimed federal prosecutors lied about some of the allegations in their indictment.

He said he was guilty only of using castor beans to make a harmless fertiliser, and that he did not make a poison which prosecutors claimed was found on one of his dust masks.

Ricin is derived from castor beans, and in a weaponised form - meaning it can easily enter the body - it can cause respiratory failure, among other symptoms.

Withdrawing his guilty plea would have opened the door to Dutschke facing a possible life sentence.

He was at his home in Tupelo when investigators found evidence of ricin at his martial arts studio in April 2013.

The judge was the only one to receive a letter, though she was not harmed. The letters to Mr Obama and Sen Wicker were intercepted.
