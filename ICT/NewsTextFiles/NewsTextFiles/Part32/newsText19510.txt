
(WLNS) - Just one week after firefighters in Meridian Township moved to a new station--- they are now forced back to their orginial spot-- due to flooding.

That means-- for now-- the township is back down to 2 stations--- the north and south.

that's not an option though for fire trucks.

In fact-- this water has forced the shut down of the central fire station.

Acting Battalion Chief Monty Nye tells 6 News, "It is somewhat of a inconvienece to our members and the crews just trying to coordinate everything."

Firefighters just moved into a temporary home here at the service center about a week ago while they wait for a new station to be built at the corner of Okemos and Central Park Drive.

But lots of rain over the last week has now forced them to move back-- since their trucks can't get through the water.

Nye adds,"It's just another reason why the temporary one isn't best for us but it will work right now until we get the permenent station in."

Nye continues,"So with the temproary fire station, we just divided the crews back up like we did before we had the temporary station."

So things are more crowded again at the north and south stations.

Take a look at this...this work office also doubles as a bedroom.

Nye says, "Tt is tough on them to be in temporary quarters. I equate it to being in almost a small hotel room."

For now the firefighters will have to wait patiently as the water subsides but they say they are anxious for the new station is built..so they can finally settle in.

Nye concludes, "Everyone is going to be very excited. It's like moving into a new home and this is our home."
