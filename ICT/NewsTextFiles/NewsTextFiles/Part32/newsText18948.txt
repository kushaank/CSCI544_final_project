
Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili thanked the Russian government for its willingness to assist in disaster relief operations in Dariali Gorge, the Cabinet of Ministers said on May 19.

"We are working to eliminate the disaster consequences in the Dariali Gorge," he said.

"Unfortunately, a landslide killed one person and a few people are considered missing. Despite the rescuers having rendered assistance to a Ukrainian citizen and taken him to one of the Georgian best clinics, he died. The Georgian government expresses its sincere condolences to the family of the deceased."

Garibashvili stressed that an emergency headquarters is operating around the clock.

A rock collapsed in Dariali Gorge last Saturday and blocked the Terek River.
