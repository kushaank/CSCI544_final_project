
FOUR people arrested in connection with a fire in South Park at the weekend have been released with no further action being taken against them.

A 17-year-old boy who was arrested on suspicion of arson with intent as well as using a motor vehicle without insurance, aggravated vehicle taking and dangerous driving has been released on bail until July 25 while the investigation continues.

Police were called to a house on Alexander Road in South Park at around 11.30pm on Saturday after a shed and parts of a house were damaged as the result of a fire.

The fire spread to the roof of the detached house next to the shed but firefighters from the Reigate, Horley and Epsom stations managed to stop the flames spreading further into the home, which was unoccupied at the time of the suspected attack.

An investigation remains underway to establish the circumstances surrounding the incident and the cause of the fire.

No-one was injured during the incident.
