
A local administrative body in Trat has called for urgent action against a mountain of garbage in its vicinity. The 15-metre high and nearly 1-kilometre-long mountain of trash is spreading foul odour and leaking dirty water that threatens to contaminate water sources nearby as well as the beach.

"We are concerned about the risk of germs spreading," Tambon Mai Rood Administrative Organisation chairman Surasak Intaraprasert said yesterday, adding the pile of garbage probably weighs over 50,000 tonnes already.

He said that the refuse dumped here comes from various sources and the locals believe they have suffered from the dumpsite for far too long already.

"The provincial government of Trat should take action and remove this garbage," Surasak said.

Trat Governor Benjawan Anpruang has promised to look into the issue and find urgent solutions.
