LO BARNECHEA — On Sunday night, a fire destroyed several houses in Lo Barnechea and damaged more. One person died during the incident.

Last night at around midnight a fire broke out in a camping spot at Juan Pablo II in the commune of Lo Barnechea. A 43-year old woman, who was the mother of a 9-year old girl died in the flames. According to the authorities, in total, the fire destroyed 6 houses and damaged 12 more.

Firefighters struggled extinguishing the fire because of the narrowness of the street and a lack of hydrants. Furthermore, some volunteers were attacked. Later, the police came to their help and cooperate with the volunteering firefighters.

“The place is very complex and very complicated to enter. Sometimes the people, even though they try to help us, complicated us a lot”, said the commander of the Fire Department of Santiago Mauricio Repetto, who remarked that the fire happened to be in an area “quite far from any fire hydrants.” 17 units of the firefighters tried to stop the fire in the East of Santiago last night, that started at about 11.30 p.m.

In circles of neighbors, the rumor exists, that adolescents are responsible for the fire in the commune. “It probably emerged from some children playing with sparks and then it spread”, said a resident of the sector.

According to Radio Bio Bio, the woman died when trying to save her daughter from the flames. When she tried to leave the house, a gas ball exploded and killed the 43-year old.
