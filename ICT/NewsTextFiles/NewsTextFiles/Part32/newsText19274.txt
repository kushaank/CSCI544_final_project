Three swimmers in distress were rescued from the ocean by Ocean City firefighters and off-duty lifeguards, resort officials reported.

It happened around 4 p.m. Sunday. Dispatchers got a call for a water rescue in the area of 20th Street and the beach. Minutes later, members of the Ocean City Fire Department arrived on the scene and witnessed three victims in the water. Two additional people, who were not in distress, were also in the water trying to help the victims.

Two fire department rescue swimmers entered the water, while two remained on shore. Two off-duty lifeguards arrived soon after that, and helped the fire department swimmers, according to a news release by the fire department.

The people involved were a 24-year-old male and two 20-year-old females from Alexandria, Va., according to resort spokeswoman Jessica Waters. The male and one female were treated on the scene. The other woman was transported to an area hospital with non-life threating injuries. Their names were not released by authorities.

Ocean Cityâ€™s lifeguards will be on-duty starting Memorial Day weekend. Members of the Ocean City Beach Patrol work from 10 a.m. until 5:30 p.m. Lifeguards end their summer duties on the third weekend in September.
