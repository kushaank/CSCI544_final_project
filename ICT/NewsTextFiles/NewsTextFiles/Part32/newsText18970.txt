
Addressing a global forum on environment, climate change and tourism, President Aquino on Monday said countries must stop being forced to make the “unfair choice” between devoting resources to disaster rehabilitation and economic development by focusing more on sound environmental management that prevents or mitigates disasters.

Speaking at the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO)-Asean International Conference on Tourism and Climate Change at The Oriental Hotel in Legazpi, Albay, Mr. Aquino recounted the government’s massive rehabilitation efforts in the aftermath of killer Supertyphoon Yolanda that hit the country last November.

“Despite the progress of our recovery efforts, we cannot ignore the resounding message that Typhoon Yolanda said to the world: If we do not tackle it head-on, this ‘new normal’ brought about by climate change will be here to stay and we will be forced to make unfair choices between disaster-risk management and development,” the President said.

Mr. Aquino admitted he had always referred to tourism in the Philippines as “a low-lying fruit.” “Our country has so many natural gifts. In fact, I am told that if you look out some of the windows of this very hotel, you can see Mayon Volcano, known around the world as the volcano with the most perfect cone.

Moreover, Mr. Aquino noted that jobs in tourism rarely require lengthy or specialized training, meaning, a wider range of Filipinos can capitalize on the opportunities it creates right away.
