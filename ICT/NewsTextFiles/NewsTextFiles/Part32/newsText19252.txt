
Fitch Ratings expects to assign a 'B/RR4' rating to Petroleos de  Venezuela, S.A.'s proposed USD5 billion senior unsecured issuance. The  company expects to use the proceeds from the issuance to finance its  investment program as well as for general corporate purposes.

PDVSA's credit quality reflects the company's linkage to the government  of Venezuela as a state-owned entity, combined with increased government  control over business strategies and internal resources. This  underscores the close link between the company's credit profile and that  of the sovereign. PDVSA's ratings also consider the company's strong  balance sheet, sizeable proven hydrocarbon reserves, and strategic  interests in international downstream assets.

PDVSA's credit quality is inextricably linked to the Venezuelan  government. It is a state-owned entity whose royalties and tax payments  have historically represented more than 50% of the government's  revenues, and it is of strategic importance to the economic and social  policies of the country. In 2008, the government changed PDVSA's charter  and mission statement to allow it to participate in industries that  contribute to the country's social development, including healthcare,  education, and agriculture.

The Venezuelan government displays limited transparency in the  administration and use of government-managed funds, and in its fiscal  operations. This factor poses challenges to accurately assess the stance  of fiscal policy and the full financial strength of the sovereign. As a  direct by-product of being a state-owned entity, PDVSA displays similar  characteristics, which reinforces the linkage of its ratings to the  sovereign, and are evidenced by the extensive amount of transactions  with its shareholder, government agencies and other related parties.  These transactions have a significantly negative impact on PDVSA's  financial position.

PDVSA continues to be an important player in the global energy sector.  The company's competitive position is strong and supported by its  sizeable reported proven hydrocarbon reserves, strategic interests in  international downstream assets and private participation in upstream  operations. The company also benefits from a strong, yet weakening  capital structure, which is in line with many of its competitors. Over  the past five years, PDVSA's total debt has increased to USD43 billion  at year-end 2013 from approximately USD25 billion at the end of 2010.  Meanwhile, EBITDA, adjusted for social expenditures, has remained  relatively flat at about USD25 billion. This level of leverage is  consistent with a higher rating category, although sovereign-related  risks offset the strength of the financial profile and constrain the  rating to that of the sovereign.

PDVSA reported an EBITDA (after royalties and social expenditure, which  include most oil bartering agreements) of approximately USD17.7 billion  as of the year end Dec. 31, 2013. Total financial debt as of Dec. 31,  2013 increased to USD43 billion, from USD40 billion in 2012. The  leverage level is low for the rating category with a net debt to EBITDA  ratio of 1.9x. Capex continues to be moderate, totaling USD94 billion  over the past five years, which has somewhat offset declining production  levels from existing fields.

PDVSA's reported hydrocarbon reserves continue to rank among the largest  in the world, with proven hydrocarbon reserves of 332 billion barrels of  oil equivalent (boe) as of year-end 2013. Proven developed hydrocarbon  reserves were approximately 20 billion boe as of December 2012, which  represents around a 15-year proven developed reserve life. Venezuela  reported oil production of approximately 3 million barrels per day (bpd)  as of year-end Dec. 31, 2013. Various independent reports have estimated  that production levels are lower than reported by the company, which  adds to risk and is incorporated into the ratings.

Catalysts for a downgrade include a downgrade to Venezuela's ratings, a  substantial increase in leverage to finance capital expenditures or  government spending and a sharp and extended commodity price downturn.  Catalysts for an upgrade include an upgrade to Venezuela's sovereign  rating and/or real independence from the government.
