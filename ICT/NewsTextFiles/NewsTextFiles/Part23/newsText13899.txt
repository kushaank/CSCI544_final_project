
That's exactly the situation faced by about 20 U.S. Steel Corp. employees who received an email in early 2010 from the then-CEO John Surma . But that email wasn't from Surma at all. It was instead the vanguard of a sophisticated cyber attack by a group of tech-savvy Chinese military officers bent on gaining access to U.S. Steel's computer systems, according to a federal indictment released Monday.

At least one, and possibly several, U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) employees fell for the trap, allowing the hackers to install malware that helped them gain access to the steelmaker's system.

"They're selecting the organizations they're going after with specific information," said Amy Baker , a vice president at Pittsburgh-based security firm Wombat Security . "They're crafting emails specifically for a particular person or individuals wtihin an organization."

A hacker or social engineer only needs a bit of information, mostly available publicly, to get enough to craft a credible-looking email. That's not only the name and perhaps email from a high-placed executive like a CEO or CFO but also social media postings that identify users of various social networks as employees of a company.
