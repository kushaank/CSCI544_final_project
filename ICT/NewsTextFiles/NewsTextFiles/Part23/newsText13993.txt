
MANILA, Philippines—The largest alliance of Protestant and non-Roman Catholic churches in the Philippines on Sunday urged an intensification of the awareness campaign on the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which could lead to the fatal acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

In a statement marking this year’s International AIDS Candle Light Memorial, the National Council of Churches in the Philippines (NCCP) stressed the need for an informed public to uphold the truth about the disease.

“While we are elated at the decreasing number of people living with HIV and the easier access to medical services worldwide, we are disturbed that people living with HIV in the Philippines are increasing at an alarming rate,” it said.

The NCCP cited recent Department of Health records showing 934 new cases of HIV infection from January to February this year, which represents a 43-percent increase over figures in the same period last year.

The group urged the DOH to implement a comprehensive HIV awareness program and drop its plans for mandatory HIV testing.

In the statement, NCCP chair Bishop Ephraim Fajutagana and NCCP general secretary Fr. Rex Reyes described as a “reactive measure” the mandatory HIV testing announced by Health Secretary Enrique Ona.
