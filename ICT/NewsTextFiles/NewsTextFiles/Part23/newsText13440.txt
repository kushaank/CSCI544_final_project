
Preparations for an agreement on long-awaited Russian natural gas exports to China have entered "the final phase", China's state-run Xinhua news agency on Monday quoted Russian President Vladimir Putin as saying ahead of a two-day visit to Shanghai this week. VoR's Tim Ecott spoke to Professor Yuri Tavrovsky from the Peoples' Friendship University of Russia.

"For Russia, implementing these agreements means diversifying gas supply destinations, while for our Chinese partners ... it could be a remedy for energy shortages and helps ecological security," Xinhua quoted Putin as saying in an interview with Chinese media ahead of the May 20-21 visit.

A deal after nearly two decades of talks would secure the world's top energy user a key chunk of supply as demand for the cleaner burning fuel is set to surge.

Some western analysts have said the West needs to be careful not to push Russia away because it may end up forging that close relationship with China you describe.

“Exactly, they are pushing us. They are also pushing China. China doesn’t feel this squeeze so acutely as we are, but they also have a lot of problems with the United States; with Japan they have this Pivot to Asia strategy, they have new bases, new ships around China. And there is another very serious problem with Taiwan. If Taiwan were to separate from China – and there is a possibility of it – then there will be a war in the Straits o Taiwan.
