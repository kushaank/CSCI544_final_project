
A 31-count indictment filed in U.S. District Court in western Pennsylvania says five officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army used various hacking techniques to steal key technology, attorney-client communications in antidumping cases and other sensitive information.

The indictment said the thefts also occurred at United Steelworkers International and Allegheny Technologies Inc. (NYSE: ATI) in Pittsburgh, and Solar World, which has domestic offices in California and Oregon.

The thefts were focused on the local companies when they were in the midst of negotiations with Chinese companies, like Westinghouse, or antidumping trade lawsuits against foreign imports like U.S. Steel (NYSE: X), Allegheny Technologies (NYSE: ATI) and United Steelworkers.

"This is a case of economic espionage," Holder said.

Holder said Chinese hackers stole the designs for components of Westinghouse Electric nuclear plants at the same time the Cranberry Township-based company was negotiating contracts to build in China, the government alleged.

Hackers also grabbed attorney-client communications and paperwork related to strategies from U.S. Steel and the United Steelworkers International Union when they were engaged in a fight to stop illegal low-cost imports of steel from China and other countries that were ravaging the steel industry.
