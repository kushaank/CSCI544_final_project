Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin and Deputy Prime Minister of the Chinese State Council Wang Yang met in the Chinese capital on Monday and signed a protocol to create a high-level working group for control over implementation of priority strategic projects in Russian-Chinese economic cooperation.

“We decided to single out most interesting projects and place them under personal control of the two deputy prime ministers,” Dmitry Rogozin told ITAR-TASS after the meeting.

“We agreed that the chiefs of Chinese and Russian space agencies will have talks soon. This is cooperation in enlarging the market of space services,” Rogozin said. “This is primarily navigation satellite systems Beidou and GLONASS, joint production of signal-reception modules, joint development of ground infrastructure to provide for all transport corridors between Russia and China and Chinese cargo transit to the West via Russia by specific navigation systems," he added.
