
KUALA LUMPUR: Pope Francis 1’s upcoming visit to Jordan underscores the deep co-existence of Jordanians of different faiths.

The May 24 visit will be the fourth papal visit of its kind.

It said the visit would emphasise the biblical importance of sites around Jordan as well as illustrate the depth of co-existence between Jordanians of different faiths.

The embassy noted the Catholic Church had designated five sites around Jordan as pilgrimage sites for the year 2000.

In this regard, it welcomed all press and media members to go to Jordan and cover the visit.

Many Malaysia Christian pilgrims to Jordan visit the Moses Memorial Church at Mt Nebo, Tell Mar Elias (St Elijah’s Hill), Bethany Beyond the Jordan where Elijah’s ascension to heaven in a chariot of fire is believed to have taken place and Jesus was baptised by John the Baptist in the Jordan River, and to cross into Israel.

The embassy said the pope would meet King Abdullah II on May 24 before heading to Amman InternaÂ­tional Stadium to give a mass sermon open to the public.

More than 92% are Sunni Muslims with small groups of Shi’ite and Druze.

About 6% are Christians who live mainly in Amman, Madaba, Karak and Salt.

While the majority are from the Greek Orthodox Church, there are also Greek Catholics, a small Roman Catholic community, Syrian OrthoÂ­dox, Coptic Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox and a few Protestant denominations found mostly in Amman.
