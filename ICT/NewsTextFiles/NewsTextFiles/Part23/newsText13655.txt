
The fourth summit of CICA will be held in Shanghai from May the 20th to May the 21st. Officially known as the Fourth Conference on Confidence Building Measures in Asia, the CICA is an international summit held every four years, aiming to facilitate stability and security in the greater Eurasian continent.

Although the CICA is not as well-known as such organizations as APEC or G20, the CICA is made up of 24 states, and 9 states which have observer status. The member states range from the Republic of Korea in the Far East, Russia in the North, India to the South, and Turkey in the West. China, of course, is also a member state.

The CICA was founded over 20 years ago in the Republic of Kazakhstan.

International security issues that jointly affect the countries in question include terrorism, border control management, the illegal trade in drugs, weapons, and human trafficking, trans-national crime, and energy security, as well as nature-based security issues like disaster management and climate change.

Russian President Vladimir Putin will be attending the summit in Shanghai, as part of his wider state visit to China.
