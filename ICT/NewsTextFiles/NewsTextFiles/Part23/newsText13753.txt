WASHINGTON, DC -- The U.S. government is about to up the stakes in an ongoing cyber war with foreign electronic enemies.

CBS News correspondent Bob Orr reports that on Monday morning, Attorney General Eric Holder will announce the first-ever economic espionage charges against hackers working for a foreign government.

The Justice Department's indictment will target China, sources say, with specific individuals expected to be named. We're told pictures of the suspects will be published.

The indictment is expected to detail a sophisticated cyber-spying campaign aimed at stealing billions of dollars worth of U.S. corporate and government secrets. Intelligence officials have estimated that American companies are losing about $250 billion per year in intellectual property -- much of that to the Chinese.

Their hackers have also infiltrated the servers of U.S. government agencies like the Federal Reserve. Chinese hackers have also breached the computer systems of American media companies including the New York Times and Washington Post to monitor U.S. coverage of Chinese politics.

It's not yet clear if federal prosecutors can actually succeed with a case against foreign suspects. Since the accused are allegedly working for the government itself, it's unlikely China would cooperate.

In fact, most cyber experts believe the charges will bring some kind of retaliation.
