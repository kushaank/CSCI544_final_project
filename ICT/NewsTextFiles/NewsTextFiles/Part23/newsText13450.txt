
It is almost one and a half month since the abduction of more than 200 teenage girls from a Girl’s school in remote northeast of the country. It took almost a month for the world’s conscience to be wrenched and still there is no news about the girls or an inkling of where they are held.

Nigerian leader President Goodluck Jonathan says that over 20000 troops are scouring the countryside searching for the abducted girls along with security experts from British, US and Israel who are helping the beleaguered regime.

The emergence of Boko Haram and its and the repugnant tactics its members has shifted attention of the world community from the Pan Islamic terror spawned by Al Qaeda to something more sinister and dangerous. The very fact that Boko Haram is devoid of any lofty ideals like the Al Qaeda or other terror groups in Middle East makes it even more unpredictable and thus dangerous. However the hostage crisis is something whose blame rests solely on the doorsteps of the Nigerian Government who had turned a blind eye to the warnings given by security agencies.

Things have not changed much and still the Nigerian government is remaining in its stupor, vacillating between formulating a tough policy against Boko Haram and sending feelers that it is ready to negotiate.
