
An angry Chinese government on Monday rejected the Obama administration’s charges of cybertheft by members of China’s military, and turned the tables by accusing the U.S. government of extensive surveillance activities against foreign leaders.

China’s reaction, which said the U.S. charges were “absurd,” also seems to be a strong indication that China will not allow the five officers to be tried in a U.S. court — dashing Attorney General Eric Holder’s hope that China would cooperate in the case.

Holder said Monday morning that five officers of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army hacked five companies: Westinghouse Electric, Alcoa, Allegheny Technologies Incorporated, U.S. Steel and SolarWorld. Holder said the United Steelworkers Union was also hacked.

And in a further sign that China will not cooperate with the U.S., Qin said China would immediately suspend a bilateral Cyber Working Group with the United States.

“China will react further to the U.S. ‘indictment’ as the situation evolves,” Qin said.

Earlier Monday, Holder said he was hopeful that China would work with the U.S. by letting the five officials to be subject to U.S. law.

Holder was asked what he could do if China didn’t cooperate. In reply, he said, “There are a range of things that we can do, and we will employ all of them,” but he did not offer any examples.
