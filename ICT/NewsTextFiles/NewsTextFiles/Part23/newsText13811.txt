
Chinaâ€™s Foreign Ministry is warning Chinese citizens not to travel to Vietnam, and announced it is suspending part of its bilateral exchange program with Vietnam.

Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hong Lei says China will take further counter measures if necessary.

The decision came after the anti-China riots in Vietnam that have already left two Chinese nationals dead and scores of factories trashed.

Earlier this month, China deployed an oil rig in the South China Sea, triggering fury in Vietnam. Chinese authorities say the oil company has been conducting normal operations within Chinese territory.
