
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said yesterday that clinching a final nuclear deal with world powers is still "possible", despite a tough round of talks this week.

"Agreement is possible. But illusions need to go. Opportunity shouldn't be missed again like in 2005," Zarif wrote on Twitter, referring to Iran's long-stalled dispute with world powers over its suspect nuclear programme.

Britain, China, France, Russia, the United States and Germany -- known as the P5+1 group --Â  want to clinch an accord by July 20, when a November interim deal expires, under which Iran froze certain activities in return for some relief from crippling Western sanctions.

In return for further concessions, the Islamic republic, which denies seeking an atomic weapon, wants the lifting of all UN and Western sanctions, which have badly damaged its economy.

The fourth round of talks between Iran and the P5+1 ended on Friday with both sides complaining that major gaps remained ahead of the July 20 deadline.
