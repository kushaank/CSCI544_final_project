
HUNDREDS of Chinese workers left Vietnam today on chartered ships after deadly unrest broke out last week over a South China Sea sovereignty dispute.

The workers had been bussed to the ships, where riot police were stationed.

Two Chinese workers were killed and 140 injured in the attack, which also left parts of the facility on fire. Around 3,000 Chinese workers were employed to build the complex.

China and Vietnam’s overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea have triggered tensions for years.

Hanoi immediately sent ships to confront the rig. They are now locked in a stalemate with Chinese ships protecting the rig, raising fears of possible conflict.

Vietnam has been trying to rally international support for its stance. The United States has labelled China’s move as provocative.

Vietnam’s government initially allowed street protests, but it has cracked down since the rioting.
