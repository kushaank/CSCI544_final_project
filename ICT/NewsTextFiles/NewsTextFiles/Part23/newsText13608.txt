
WARSAW - More than 60 Polish dairy products have been accredited as exporters to China and Polish food will also be allowed into the Shanghai customs-free zone, Polish Agriculture Mini ster Marek Sawicki said on Monday.

Sawicki said the Chinese offer could help the dairy sector, of which sales to Russia and Ukraine have gone down owing to the ongoing conflict between both countries.

The minister said that within the next couple of months Polish food products will be allowed into the Shanghai customs-free zone.

According to Sawicki, this may help food producers make up losses suffered through the Ukraine crisis.
