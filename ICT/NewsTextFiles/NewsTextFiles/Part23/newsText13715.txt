Our roundtable of experts discusses the escalating situation with ISIS, and the US options for responding.

WASHINGTON — The US government today took the unprecedented step of charging five officers in the Chinese Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) with 31 criminal counts of hacking and cyber espionage against six American companies.

The indictment handed down by a grand jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania charges that the six PLA officers with the infamous cyber Unit 61398 conspired to hack into private American companies to steal trade secrets and give unfair competitive advantage to Chinese state-owned companies.

At a press conference Monday morning, Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Carlin said the Chinese government has repeatedly challenged the US government to publicly release any charges that could stand up in court, and that these charges are Washingtons response.

Robert Anderson, FBI executive assistant director for criminal and cyber crimes, said charges like these should be looked at as the new normal, this is what youre going to see on a regular basis from the US government to protect the principle of open competition in the global economic landscape.

While there is likely little chance that the Chinese government will hand over the five officers for prosecution in the United States, Attorney General Eric Holder insisted that this was the intent of making the charges public.

DavidHickton, US attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, also alleged on Monday morning that the hackers stole internal strategy, attorney client conversations, and in the case of Westinghouse, did so at a time when the company was in the midst of negotiations to build a nuclear power plant in China.

He added that as a result of the hacking against companies bidding for work in China, there has been a real and demonstrable loss of jobs in the United States. This cyber hacking leads directly to the loss of jobs here in the United States, he insisted.

The move is part of a stronger line the White House has taken over the past two years on cyber crimes that it charges have been launched by Chinese, Iranian and North Korean hackers. In January 2013, the Obama administration sent a secret formal diplomatic protest to the Chinese government over intrusions into US corporate systems.

The United States and China have worked together on these issues, however. In April of last year, the State Department announced the formation of a working group to address cybersecurity with Chinese partners, which was in line with promises by Beijing that it was eager to work with the United States on the issue.

In March, the New York Times and Der Spiegel reported that the National Security Agency (NSA) had obtained sensitive data and monitored the communications of executives from the Chinese firm Huawei, the worlds No. 2 telecom equipment maker.

Also in March, US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced that the Pentagon was working on plans to more than triple its cybersecurity staff over the next several years.
