WASHINGTON â€” The U.S. accused Chinese military officials of hacking into several U.S. enterprises to steal trade secrets and intellectual property in an indictment to be made public Monday, two senior federal law enforcement officials said.

It is the first time the U.S. has charged a state actor in a criminal cyber espionage case.

Federal law enforcement sources said the Chinese hackers, using military and intelligence resources, downloaded massive amounts of industrial information, including strategic plans, from U.S. businesses.

Attorney General Eric Holder is scheduled to announce the indictment, billed as a national security case, at 10 a.m. at the Justice Department.
