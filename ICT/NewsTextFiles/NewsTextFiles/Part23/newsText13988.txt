
I was shocked to see the news photo of some ultra-Orthodox Jews protesting Pope Francis' visit to Jerusalem [May 13].

This is not helpful in the bettering of relations between Christians -- and in particular, Catholics -- and Jews, which have improved in the past few decades.

Can you imagine if the chief rabbi of Israel visited Rome, and Catholics protested with signs saying, "Stay in Israel. Rome belongs to the Catholic people?" Apparently bigotry and intolerance can be found anywhere.
