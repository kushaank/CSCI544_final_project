
A first-ever legal case is brewing in Pittsburgh as the U.S. Department of Justice has charged five officers of the Chinese Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army with cyber espionage, stealing trade secrets from United States Steel Corp., Westinghouse Electric Co. and others â€” but itâ€™s a long shot if it comes to trial.

David Hickton , U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, said the federal government intends to try the suspects in Pittsburgh if they can be secured from China. Hickton was a participant in a news conference in Washington, D.C., with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder Monday announcing the charges. United Steelworkers International, Allegheny Technologies Inc. (NYSE: ATI) , Alcoa Inc. (NYSE: AA) and Solar World were also targeted by the hackers.

The key word is â€œif,â€� several lawyers said.

â€œI would hazard that the chance of these individuals being extradited with the cooperation of the Chinese government is about zero,â€� said Jack Tomarchio , a shareholder of Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney and chair of its cybersecurity and data protection practice. He is also a former principal deputy under secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
