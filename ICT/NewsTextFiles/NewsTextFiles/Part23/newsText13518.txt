
MANILA - Former senator Leticia Ramos-Shahani observed on Monday that the Philippine government panel that negotiated with the United States on the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement has apparently no respect for the historical background behind the Senate's rejection of the RP-US Bases Agreement in 1991.

"After the expiration in 1991 of the agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and United States of America concerning foreign military bases, troops, or facilities were not to be allowed in the Philippines except under a treaty duly concurred in by the Senate and, if Congress so requires, ratified by the majority of votes cast by the people in a national referendum held for that purpose and recognized as a treaty by other contracting country," Shahani asserted.

Second, he added, there should have been a declaration on issues including the terms of reference governing their bilateral talks.

"What we have in EDCA is a Terms of Reference but without the joint statement of the respective heads of state,” Robles said, and adding as well the observation that the signatories, a defense secretary and an ambassador, do not exactly dovetail in rank or level of position.

Also, Robles said, the questions of territoriality and compensation was not stipulated in EDCA.

"Every time a question is asked, the answer is that we will talk about that,” he said.

"What EDCA did was to intensify the conflict already there. We failed to pursue prospective further opportunities to have dialogue with China," Rivera said.
