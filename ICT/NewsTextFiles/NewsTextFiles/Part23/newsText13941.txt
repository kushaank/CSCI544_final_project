
The impending visit of Pope Francis is set to lead to a spike in Christian tourism to Israel, according to officials in the state.

Christians already account for most of the tourism market in this part of the world, yet experts have forecast an even sharper rise in the coming months due to the publicity created by the papal visit, which is scheduled for later this month.

“As a result of the visit to the Holy Land by Pope Francis, who is such a popular figure and significant leader for the world's 1.2 billion Catholics, the ministry estimates an increase of tens of thousands in the numbers of Christians visiting Israel,” the ministry explained.

What’s more, it has been revealed that 2013 was a record year for tourism to Israel.
