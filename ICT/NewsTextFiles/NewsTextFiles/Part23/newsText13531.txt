
SEOUL, May 19 (Yonhap) -- The top South Korean official handling North Korean affairs plans to visit China this week to attend a regional security summit, an official said Monday.

Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae is set to deliver a speech on Wednesday calling for stability on the Korean Peninsula at the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia, the ministry official said.

The two-day conference, which begins on Tuesday in Shanghai, is a multinational forum meant to promote peace, security and stability in Asia. It will bring together leaders of 24 member states and observers, including U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and the Iranian and Russian presidents.

North Korea did not join the regional conference.

Ryoo's trip comes amid lingering tensions on the Korean Peninsula over North Korea's possible nuclear test.

Pyongyang has threatened to carry out a "new form" of nuclear test in anger over a United Nations condemnation of its ballistic missile launches in March.
