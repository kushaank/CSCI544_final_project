
The French rogue trader responsible for a £4.5 billion fraud was in custody today after handing himself in to French authorities.

Jerome Kerviel, 37, was arrested last night after crossing the border into France from Italy following a visit to the Pope in Rome.

Kerviel had made an 11th hour appeal to President Francois Hollande to help him avoid custody, and at one stage threatened to remain a fugitive. But he realised that an EU-wide arrest warrant would have been issued and he would have quickly been brought to justice.

French finance minister Michael Sapin said Kerviel was “a crook” who had been justly convicted following a long legal process. Kerviel, who is now due to start a three-year jail term, has pledged to detail “all the serious failings” that brought Societe Generale to the brink of bankruptcy in 2008.
