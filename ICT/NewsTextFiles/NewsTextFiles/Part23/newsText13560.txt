
YANGON (Reuters) - Two Chinese workers have been abducted at a copper mine in Myanmar at the centre of a long-running dispute over land rights and their company said on Monday it was worried they would be harmed unless it stopped work.

Two Chinese contractors and a colleague from Myanmar were abducted on Sunday but the Myanmar national was freed the same day, said Cao Desheng, a spokesman for Myanmar Wanbao, a unit of Chinese weapons manufacturer China North Industries Corp.

"We are very worried about our Chinese colleagues," Cao told Reuters. "We hope and pray for their safe release."

Cao said a group calling itself the "Student Network of Mandalay" had contacted the company and told it to stop its work or it would harm the two workers. Mandalay is central Myanmar's main city.

"We don't know who these activists are," Cao said, adding that company officials had been negotiating with communities around the mine about its expansion.

"We do know some villagers aren't accepting the project," he said.

The Letpadaung mine in Monywa, about 100 km (60 miles) west of Mandalay, has faced protests from residents of the area who say thousands of acres of land were illegally confiscated to make way for its expansion.

In November 2012, riot police raided camps set up by protesters, injuring more than 100 people, including at least 67 monks.
