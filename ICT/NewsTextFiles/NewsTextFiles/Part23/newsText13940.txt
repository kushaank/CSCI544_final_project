
Prague - The ANO movement would win the Czech election to the European Parliament closely followed by the Social Democrats (CSSD), according to the latest CVVM agencyÂ´s poll released today, which is the last day when opinion polls may be published before the weekend EP election.

From Tuesday, May 20 to 14:00 on Saturday, May 24, when the polling stations close in the Czech Republic, no opinion polls may be released.

The CVVM poll, performed in early May, showed that 25 percent of Czechs would support ANO and 23 percent the CSSD.

The Communist Party (KSCM) is the third most popular party with 11 percent of the vote.

The right-wing opposition TOP 09 and Civic Democrats (ODS) gained 8 and 6 percent, respectively. The junior coalition Christian Democrats (KDU-CSL) won 6 percent, being the last party that would get a seat in the European Parliament.

No other party got close to the 5-percent threshold to win an MEP: the Greens, the Pirates and the Party of Free Citizens received 2 percent of the vote each.

The populist Dawn of Direct Democracy gained only 1 percent, according to the poll.

The turnout would be 35 percent, the poll showed.

CVVM noted that the poll is neither an election prognosis nor an election model.

The EP election will be held on May 23 and May 24 in the Czech Republic. Its results will be released only at night on May 25, after the polling stations in the last EU member country close.
