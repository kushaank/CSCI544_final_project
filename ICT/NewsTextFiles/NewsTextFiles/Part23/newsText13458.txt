
Trade ministers from the Asia-Pacific region wrapped up their latest meeting in the Chinese coastal city Qingdao this morning. China’s Minister of Commerce Gao Hucheng held a joint press conference with the other APEC ministers, saying they had agreed on actions to improve trade and economic growth across the Asia-Pacific.

He said the APEC economies would work on lowering trade barriers as part of last year’s "Bali package" and repeated their commitment to a multilateral trade mechanism.

APEC members also reached consensus over global value chain cooperation, regional connectivity, reform and facilitating growth. The key focus of the meeting was regional economic integration.

Mr. Gao says APEC members will push ahead with creating a vast free trade agreement for the Asia Pacific.

"We will establish a working group for regional economic integration under APEC’s trade and investment committee, and work to draw up a road map for establishing the Free Trade Agreement for Asia-Pacific. We will also launch an information sharing mechanism across APEC and increase transparency between various free trade areas."
