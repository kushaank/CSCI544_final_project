
Regnier, an Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture Distinguished Professor, received his first Fulbright grant in 1992 and analyzed supportive housing models in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland and the Netherlands. His work resulted in three books and through his consulting, the development of innovative assisted-living projects throughout the United States. He is one of three USC professors so far in 2014 to receive Fulbright awards.

Exploring ways for housing and services to assist the aging frail to become more independent is of paramount concern to families.

The professor was asked by the graduate program at the architecture school at The Catholic University of Portugal at Viseu to apply for the Fulbright. This fall, he will be lecturing there on housing design and policy, as well as the need for non-institutional purpose-built housing for frail seniors. In the spring, he will work with design studio students on housing projects that take mental and physical impairments of the elderly into consideration. He will also visit and assess several projects for the elderly in Lisbon and the country’s south coast.

Governments and policymakers often see only one alternative, he said, which is to build more nursing homes and hospitals.

In addition to producing books and scholarly articles, Regnier as a practicing architect has consulted on more than 400 building projects in 38 states, Canada, Germany and England. More than 50 of these projects have won design awards.

At USC Architecture and USC Davis, he teaches a seminar on purpose-built housing and community settings for the elderly. For the past 20 years, he also has taught graduate design studios and a unique and popular class (“Great Houses of Los Angeles”) that involves curatorial tours of 10 historically significant early to mid-20th century houses.
