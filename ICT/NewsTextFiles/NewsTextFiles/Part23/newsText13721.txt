
On Monday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced indictments against five officers in China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) for “serious cybersecurity breaches” against six American firms: Westinghouse Electric, a division of Toshiba (OTC: TOSBF ) , Alcoa (NYSE: AA ), Allegheny Technologies (NYSE: ATI ), U.S. Steel (NYSE: X ), the United Steelworkers Union and SolarWorld (OTC: SRWRY ).

The five PLA officers are reportedly in China, and it is unlikely that Beijing will hand them over to the United States.

China's Foreign Affairs Ministry denied the U.S. claims.

China also took the U.S. government to task over its own, highly-publicized online surveillance activities.

Last year, the New York Times ran a lengthy report on China's extensive efforts to break into American corporations, organizations and government agencies via a special, Shanghai-based cyber-intelligence unit.

But Monday's announcement, says one analyst, is ground-breaking. Frank Cilluffo, head of the Homeland Security Policy Institute at the George Washington University, told Reuters it indicates “that DOJ has 'smoking keyboards' and [is] willing to bring the evidence to a court of law and be more transparent."

Bonnie Glaser, a senior Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says the carefully-prepared indictments also indicate that U.S. diplomatic efforts to discourage such cyber-hacking by China have not worked.
