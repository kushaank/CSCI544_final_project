Mariam Yahia Ibrahim Ishag, 27, was born to a Muslim father, who left her mother to bring her up alone from when she was very young, and an Ethiopian Orthodox Christian mother. She was raised in her mother's faith and married a Christian man. She was reportedly turned in to the authorities by one of her relatives who claimed Mariam was committing adultery by marrying Daniel Wani, a Christian. She was sentenced to death on 15 May 2014 for allegedly committing apostasy from Islam, because although she says she has always been a Christian, the prosecution claimed she should have followed the faith of her absent father, and demanded, with the support of the judge, that she abandon her Christian faith. She was given three days to do so, but refused, arguing that she had been a Christian all her life, and could not rescind her beliefs at the request of a court.
