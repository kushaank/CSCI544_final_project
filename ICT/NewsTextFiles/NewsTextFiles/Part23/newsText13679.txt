
TAIPEI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- An promotional exhibition of sightseeing tours to Taiwan's ethnic minorities areas will run from May 23 to 26.

Since an episode of the documentary "A Bite of China II" introduced flying fish and the ethic minorities of Orchid Island, an islet near southeast Taiwan's Taitung county, more mainlanders are expected to be attracted to visit undisturbed areas of Taiwan, said the island's ethnic minorities affairs administrative authority on Monday.

Mainland visitors take it easy and experience the culture through the promoted tours, said Lin Chiang-Yi, head of the authority.

According to Taiwan's executive, tourists from the Chinese mainland have brought 355 billion new Taiwan dollars (11.8 billion U.S. dollars) to Taiwan since 2008 when the island opened its doors to mainland tourists and the number of group visitors has surpassed 7,000,000.
