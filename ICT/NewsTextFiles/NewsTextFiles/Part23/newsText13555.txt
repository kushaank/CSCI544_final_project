One of the most stressful and important tasks in any special operations, as competitively practiced in the 6th Warrior Competition, is evacuating wounded friendly and civilian casualties to medical care.

Since 2010, Chinese delegations have rocketed to the top of international special operations, police and military sniper competitions, benefiting from increased training and better weapons.  It is important to note, however, that many top special operations units were not present at this training competition (including notable US and Russian forces presently active on operations) and that the kind of skills tested in the Warrior Competition form only part of special operations and counterterrorism capabilities.  Special operations success also comes from a massive amount of preparation, organization, doctrine, intelligence and logistics not on display at the Warrior Competition, including classified capabilities. Yet these kind of competition results, as well as broader increases in general Chinese military, cyber and electronic intelligence capabilities, points to the significant gains Chinese special forces have made in their capabilities in recent years.

One of the most challenging tasks at Warrior Competition, and in real life counterterrorist operations, is to breach a hijacked airliner to simultaneously rescue hostages and neutralize the hijackers in a confined and crowded space.  This 2013 picture shows the King Abdullah Special Operation Training Center's Airbus, which is heavily used for this purpose.
