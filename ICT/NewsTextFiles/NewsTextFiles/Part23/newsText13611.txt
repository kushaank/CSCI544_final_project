
BEIJING, May 19 (Yonhap) -- U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday held talks addressing North Korea's nuclear program, the ongoing crisis in Ukraine and the civil war raging in Syria, China's foreign ministry said.

The meeting between Ban, who is on a four-day visit to China from Sunday, and Xi took place in Shanghai ahead of a regional security summit there, the Chinese ministry said in a statement. This week's two-day summit, the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA), is aimed at promoting trust among member states.

Ban and Xi "exchanged views on the situation on the Korean Peninsula, Ukraine, Syria, climate change and other issues," the statement said, without elaborating.

North Korea has threatened to conduct its fourth nuclear test since late March, although recent satellite images showed no immediate signs of a test.

South Korea and the United States have called for China, North Korea's last remaining ally and economic lifeline, to put more pressure on the North to abandon its nuclear weapons program and change course.
