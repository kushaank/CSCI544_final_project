
The wife of  Kwara governor, Mrs Omolewa Ahmed, on Monday  in Ilorin organised a special prayer session for the safe release of the abducted school girls in Chibok, Borno.

Speaking at the forum which held at the Government House, Ahmed said the prayer session was to seek God’s intervention in the release of the girls who were abducted by the Boko Haram sect.

“What we are doing in Kwara is our  way of showing  concern at  what is going on because it could have been anybody’s daughter.

“ We are really touched  and we believe so much in prayers in the state.

“ We are mothers and we are fulfilling our roles and that is why we are invoking on the creator to come to our aid.

“ I know that our men are doing what they should do, but as mothers, we call on God, our creator,  to intervene in our matter so that we can have peace in Nigeria,’’ Ahmed said.

She urged all mothers in the country to seek God’s  intervention in the matter so as to restore peace in the country.
