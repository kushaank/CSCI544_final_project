
SINGAPORE: Asian rubber futures rallied 5 percent on Monday after inventories in Shanghai fell to their lowest level since December and oil prices firmed, but worries about China's economy could limit gains.

The most active rubber contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange for September delivery rose 5 percent to end at 14,550 yuan a tonne, its strongest since late April. Tokyo futures tracked Shanghai higher and rose more than 4 percent.

Inventories in warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange dipped 2.2 percent week-on-week to their lowest level since December at 163,097 tonnes. However, stocks in Qingdao are estimated to have increased to around 362,000 tonnes from around 360,000 tonnes last week and 290,000 tonnes in January.

The high inventory in Qingdao could make it tough for Tokyo futures, which set the tone for global prices, to breach key resistance levels at 209-210 yen a kg. The Tokyo market has fallen about 25 percent this year on concerns over economic growth in China.

"The stocks in Qingdao are very high. I think for this week, 210 yen will be the key resistance," said an analyst in Tokyo.

The most active October rubber contract on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange hit a high of 208.4 yen a kg, its strongest since late April, and settled 6.5 yen higher at 206.5 yen.

"Maybe the price will still be supported at 200 yen. When the price gets over 209 yen, it may touch 220. But, it still needs strong news, such as bad weather," said Gu Jiong, an analyst at Yutaka Shoji Co in Tokyo.

"Without that, it will be kept in a narrow range. Although Shanghai (inventory) is falling, there's still plenty of stocks in Qingdao," said Gu.

The front-month rubber contract on Singapore's SICOM exchange for June delivery was last traded at 171.50 U.S. cents a kg, up 2.40 cents.

Growth in average new home prices in China slowed to a near one-year low in April, data showed on Sunday, adding to concerns about the weakness of the property market and what policymakers can do if prices start to fall too sharply.

Brent crude rose to $110 a barrel on Monday on renewed concerns over Libya's oil output and following some of the worst violence in Tripoli since the 2011 war against Muammar Gaddafi.
