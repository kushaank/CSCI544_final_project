
The Department of Justice is preparing to charge Chinese government officials with stealing American trade secrets through cyber espionage, according to multiple reports.

According to the Wall Street Journal , the Justice Department will charge five individuals who allegedly worked for the People's Liberation Army with hacking into U.S. company systems.

The charges would mark the first time the U.S. has brought cyber espionage charges against a state actor.

"They used military and intelligence facilities to commit cyber espionage against U.S. companies," a U.S. official told NBC's Pete Williams .

The Justice Department has announced a 10 a.m. news conference, where Attorney General Eric Holder and three other officials will announce a "criminal indictment in a national security case." A spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for further comment.
