
Vitaly Ignatenko, president of the World Association of the Russian Press (WARP), says that the World Congress of Russian Press hosted by China will greatly promote the communication and cooperation between the media organizations of China and Russia and further set up a effective platform for the people of the two nations to understand each other better.

He made the remarks on Sunday during an interview with CRI on the sidelines of the ongoing 16th World Congress of Russian Press in Shanghai.

Ignatenko stressed that political and business leaders in Russia take strong interest in China. Meanwhile, the young people in Russia desire to learn about the studying, working and living conditions of their peers in China. The Congress held in China will help eliminate the prejudice and stereotypes formed over the course of history between the ordinary people of the two countries and deepen cultural exchanges.

The World Congress of Russian Press is a routine annual conference for WARP. Jointly held by both CRI and ITAR-TASS, the 16th World Congress of Russian Press is being held in Shanghai from May 18 to May 21. The event is being held in China for the first time.
