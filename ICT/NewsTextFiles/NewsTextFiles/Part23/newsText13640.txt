
MOSCOW, May 19 (RIA Novosti) – Moscow’s Mosinzhproekt has signed a deal in Beijing with China Railway Construction and China International Fund to cooperate on a planned expansion of the Moscow Metro, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin told journalists Monday.

“We have met in Moscow not that long ago and agreed to invite investments for the construction of the Moscow Metro,” Sobyanin said.

“This program is one of the largest in the world. It of course comes short of the Beijing or Shanghai program, but nevertheless in Europe it is the largest one – we are talking about building 150 kilometers [93 miles] of subway lines, more than 70 stations,” he added.

The Moscow mayor noted that one of the new metro lines covers the territory of New Moscow, which is 150 percent larger, requiring a rapid development of transportation infrastructure, including new roads and metro stations.

“We agreed to develop a project, which will allow us to invest into this line together with our Chinese partners, to build it in the short term, to build transfer hubs. It will be the key project for attracting private investments from China to balance the Moscow investment package and accelerate the development of investment and infrastructural projects,” the mayor said.

The deal was reached during Sobyanin’s working visit to China. The agreement was signed by Deputy Mayor for Urban Development and Construction Marat Khusnullin, who earlier said that the new metro line in New Moscow is planned to open in 2018.
