Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s state visit to China this week has fueled speculation that both sides will finally reach a deal to supply Russian natural gas to China after a decade of wrangling.

There are plenty of reasons Beijing and Moscow will finally see eye to eye. But an analysis of the situation shows they still have plenty of room to disagree.

China and Russia have signed non-binding agreements before — most notably in 2009 and in 2013 — where they ironed out details that included the construction of a pipeline to ship 38 billion cubic meters of gas annually to China from fields in eastern Siberia. However, neither side has ever agreed on pricing .

Analysts say Beijing and Moscow have never been closer to a deal. Russia needs energy customers due to its standoff with the West over Ukraine. China need to meet rising energy needs and reduce dependence on polluting coal. Earlier this year, China raised its target for natural-gas consumption to as much as 420 billion cubic meters a year by 2020, up from 170 billion cubic meters in 2013.

One breakthrough in talks would be for Russia to finally offer China an equity stake in its gas fields in eastern Siberia, analysts say. OAO Gazprom , Russia’s natural-gas company, has traditionally been against this.

However, Russian state-oil giant OAO Rosneft announced a deal last year with China National Petroleum Corp. to jointly develop massive energy reserves in eastern Siberia. Under that deal, CNPC would hold a 49% stake in a joint-venture company that would develop the fields.

“It would be a milestone if Russia allows China to own a stake in a gas field instead of just buying the gas,” said Gordon Kwan, regional head of oil and gas research at Nomura.

Rob Patterson, a Moscow-based partner at law firm Vinson & Elkins, said Russia has taken a more open attitude toward Chinese investment and now views China as a major customer for its natural resources and downstream oil products.

For starters, time is in China’s favor. Russia comes to the table with fewer options than ever before thanks to increasing disengagement with the West and sagging demand for natural gas in western Europe. China, meanwhile, has started importing natural gas via pipeline from Myanmar and also has deals in place with Qatar, Australia, Indonesia and Malaysia for imports of liquefied natural gas — the chilled and exportable form of the cleaner-burning fuel.

The price China demands also could be unpalatable. China paid about $10 per million British thermal units, or million BTUs, last year for natural gas piped from its biggest foreign supplier, Turkmenistan, and likely wants a similar deal with Russia, analysts have said. However, that level is below an average price of $12 per million BTUs that Gazprom would need to break even, they say.

That’s amid a global gas glut. Prices for gas in North America are around $4 per million BTUs. China isn’t going to get those sorts of prices because that gas can’t be easily transported across the Pacific Ocean. But it illustrates the low-price environment that informs Beijing.

Mr. Patterson said there are probably other issues in addition to price that still need to be hammered out. China will likely want to bring into the discussion the delivery route of the gas pipeline, while Russia will probably want China to help finance the pipeline and other related infrastructure with billions of dollars in prepayments.
