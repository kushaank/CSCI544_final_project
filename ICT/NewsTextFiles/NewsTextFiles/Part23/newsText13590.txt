
Ten secondary school teachers will experience many facets of Shanghai on a study trip designed to encourage more content about Asia in New Zealand classrooms.

The teachers will head to Shanghai this week (Sunday 25 May to Saturday 31 May) to participate in a week-long forum organised by the Asia New Zealand Foundation.

The aim of the trip is to provide secondary school teachers with first-hand experience of business, culture and customs in China, so they are inspired to include more Asia content in their teaching. They will hear from a range of different industries to give them a broad knowledge of China’s economy.

The teachers will be briefed by New Zealand government agencies and will meet with representatives of Disney Corporation, The Warehouse, Zespri, and consultancy firm Redfern Associates, which is headed by New Zealander Scott Brown.

They will also visit Shanghai’s urban planning museum, factories in the city of Changshu, English language newspaper Shanghai Daily, andThe Brew – a microbrewery set up by New Zealander Leon Mickelson.

Mr Johnstone says that while recognition of China’s importance to New Zealand has grown in recent years, many teachers did not learn about the country during their own education. Fewer still have travelled to China.

“Teachers who have participated in our previous study tours to Shanghai have gone back to their schools with a new perspective on the importance of Asia to New Zealand.

The Asia New Zealand Foundation is a non-profit, non-partisan organisation dedicated to building New Zealand’s links with Asia through a range of programmes, including business, culture, education, media, research and a Leadership Network. The Foundation is celebrating its 20th Anniversary this year.
