
BEIJING — China vigorously denied U.S. charges Monday that members of a secretive military unit in Shanghai engaged in cyber-espionage against American companies, calling the allegations “absurd” and asserting that China is actually the “victim” of U.S. cybertheft and spying.

Reacting to an indictment unveiled by the Obama administration against five People’s Liberation Army officers, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that Beijing is suspending participation in the Sino-U.S. Cyber Working Group, a body established in April 2013 to follow up allegations of Chinese hacking attacks on U.S. entities.
