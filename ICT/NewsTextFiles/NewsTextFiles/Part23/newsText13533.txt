
SEOUL, May 20 (Yonhap) -- The top South Korean official handling North Korean affairs departed Tuesday for China to attend a regional security summit, the unification ministry said.

The trip to Shanghai by Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae comes amid lingering tensions on the Korean Peninsula over North Korea's possible nuclear test.

Pyongyang has threatened to carry out a "new form" of nuclear test in anger over a United Nations condemnation of its ballistic missile launches in March.

On Wednesday, Ryoo is set to deliver a speech calling for stability on the Korean Peninsula at the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia, a ministry official said.

The two-day conference, which begins on Tuesday, is a multinational forum meant to promote peace, security and stability in Asia. High-profile participants include U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and the Iranian and Russian presidents.

North Korea did not join the regional conference.
