
Inovio Pharmaceuticals announced that it has acquired global rights excluding China for early preclinical therapies for Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. The therapies are based on the work of Dr. Bin Wang, a professor at Fudan University's Shanghai Medical College.

The company said it will make clinical and regulatory milestone payments to the University in view of Dr. Wang’s academic research. Dr. Wang has authored several of the earliest DNA vaccine papers and patents. He has worked closely with Dr. David Weiner at the University of Pennsylvania.

Dr. Wang and Dr. Weiner discovered a new method of generating inducible regulatory T cells (iTreg). The researchers were able to generate CD25-iTreg cells in an antigen-specific manner, which could be used to develop therapies targeting inflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease. MS affects more than 350,000 patients in the U.S. alone and about 2.5 million worldwide. The disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system and is one of the leading causes of non-traumatic disability among young adults and middle-aged people. AD is the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S. and affects approximately 5.2 million U.S. patients. The annual figure of new cases of AD is forecasted to double by 2050.

The technologies are based on patent-protected and published work of the researchers, which Inovio has licensed as preclinical synthetic products as treatment for the two major inflammatory diseases.
