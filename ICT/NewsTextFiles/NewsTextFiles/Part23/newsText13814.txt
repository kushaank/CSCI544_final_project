
NAY PYI TAW, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councilor and Defense Minister Chang Wanquan, who is currently here to attend the ASEAN-China Defense Ministers' Meeting, met with Vietnamese Defense Minister Phung Quang Thanh on Monday.

Vietnam has recently disrupted China's normal and legitimate oil drilling in Chinese territorial waters near the Xisha Islands, Chang said, and serious violence including vandalism, looting and arson targeting Chinese enterprises and nationals has occurred in Vietnam.

China firmly opposes and strongly condemns these acts, he said.

Normal drilling operations in waters of China's Xisha Islands are China's rights, and nobody can block such activities, Chang said.

The Vietnamese side should respect the history, face up to reality and look at the bigger picture of China-Vietnam friendship instead of making repeated mistakes, he said.

For his part, Phung Quang Thanh said the Vietnamese party, government and armed forces highly value the friendship with China.

Vietnam's armed forces would not take any action that complicates the situation and are willing to continue to communicate with China over related issues, he said.
