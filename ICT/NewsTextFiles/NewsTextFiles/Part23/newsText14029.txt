
BEIRUT: The Maronite League warned Monday against a presidential vacuum, saying it would keep its session open to maintain pressure on Parliament.

“The  Maronite League is concerned over any delay in holding the presidential election on time and considers that a void in the presidency post would lead to paralysis in the state,” the league said in a statement. “The league joins the call by Maronite Patriarch Beshara Rai on the lawmakers to secure quorum for the Parliament session Thursday."

The league also said it decided to keep its session open to follow up on the election and pressure MPs to act to avoid any vacuum in the presidency.
