
Nurses in a Chinese hospital have swapped the traditional short skirts of nursing uniforms for those of AIR HOSTESSES.

They were given a month's training by real flight attendants from China Eastern Airlines and now wear the outfits, which hospital staff say have slightly longer skirts for reasons that "everybody understands", on the ward.

Bu Haijuan, head of Lianshui Huaian Hospital of Chinese Medicine's nursing unit, explained that customer service is behind the move.

"Nurses learn all sorts of technical skills at college but customer service can be easily overlooked. But flight attendants are specifically trained to have a good attitude and manners."

The move, which sees the 12 nurses who wear the outfits being paid more and taking on a heavier workload, has raised eyebrows.

But one nurse from the one ward trialling the change said she's sleeping two hours earlier so she looks better in the morning, whereas another avoids fatty foods for the same reason.

"Cooks can wear white uniforms. Butchers can wear white uniforms. There is no regulation saying that nurses have to wear white," continued Ms Bu.

"We should think outside the box. We are trying to make the best use of our resources to improve our customer service."
