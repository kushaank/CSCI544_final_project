
Archbishop Christopher Prowse was among 80 bishops from Australia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and the Pacific nations who gathered in Wellington, New Zealand, for the Assembly of the Federation of Catholic Bishops Conferences of Oceania.

For the bishops it was a rare opportunity for reflection, prayer, discussion and informal time together.

During the opening Mass, the Apostolic Nuncio to New Zealand and the Pacific Islands, Archbishop Martin Krebs, read a message sent by the Holy Seeâs Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin on behalf of Pope Francis. In it Pope Francis offered his prayerful support and his hope that during their time together the bishops would find inspiration and strength for their common mission in the service of God's people.

The bishops were deeply concerned when they heard Bishop Eugene Hurley speak about the desperate situation of detainees in Australian detention centres. Bishops from Papua New Guinea and the Bishop of Tarawa in Nauru spoke of the effects of detention centres on the people of Manus Island and Nauru.

Bishops Barry Jones and Mike Stopforth presented a session on the earthquakes and their impact on the city of Christchurch and its diocese.

The bishops also discussed topics that will be considered at the Extraordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops to be held in Rome in October this year.

The assembly takes place every four years in a different part of Oceania. The 2018 Assembly will be held in Papua New Guinea.
