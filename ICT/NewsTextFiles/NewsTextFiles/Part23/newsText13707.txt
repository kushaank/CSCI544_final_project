
The Justice Department announced charges against individuals in the Chinese military, accusing them of hacking U.S. companies for trade secrets, the first time the U.S. government has publicly accused employees of a foreign power with cybercrimes against U.S. firms.

The move to charge five individuals who allegedly worked for the People’s Liberation Army to hack into U.S. company systems marks a major escalation of the  fight with China over such intrusions . U.S. government officials have long complained that China aggressively targets U.S. companies for trade secrets that would give  Chinese companies a competitive advantage —a charge China has denied, saying such accusations have no basis in fact.

Attorney General  Eric Holder  and senior Federal Bureau of Investigation officials announced the charges Monday morning.

The charges have been filed against five people who allegedly worked for a part of the People’s Liberation Army known as Unit 61398 in Shanghai, these people said. The hackers allegedly stole some of the design information for a nuclear power plant, as well as cost and pricing information from a solar panel firm, these people said.

An  indictment unsealed Monday  charges five individuals, named Wang Dong, Sun Kailiang, Wen Xinyu, Huang Zhenyu and Gu Chunhui, with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse.

FBI posters related to the case.

The suspects were allegedly part of a group that hacked into U.S. systems to obtain information about 1,753 computers at U.S. Steel, piping systems for nuclear power plants form Westinghouse Electric Company, and employee email accounts for officials at a union of manufacturing and energy workers, according to the indictment. The union, the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, also known as USW, had long criticized Chinese trade practices.

Another company, Allegheny Technologies Inc., a specialty metals manufacturer, had its network credentials for thousands of employees stolen, according to U.S. officials. The hacking allegedly took place from 2010 to 2012.

Allegheny Technology was aware of the indictment but “we’re not going to comment,” at least for now, said Dan Greenfield, vice president for investor relations and communications at the Pittsburgh-based maker of alloys and other materials used in a wide variety of industries.

The hackers also targeted Alcoa Inc. executives, and were able to steal at least 2,907 emails and roughly 863 attachments from that company’s computer system, the indictment charges.

The indictment was handed up by a grand jury in Pittsburgh, a city close to many of the U.S. firms targeted.

In a highly unusual move, prosecutors also released photos of the suspects, including one man in military uniform. The release of the photographs points to one of the factors that make the case unique: It is highly unlikely China will turn the suspects over to the U.S. for prosecution, so the indictment may act instead as a public effort to name and shame the suspects.

The move was long-planned, dating back at least a year as the Obama administration was searching for more punitive measures to take against Chinese hackers.
