
KUALA LUMPUR, May 19 (Bernama) -- The middle of the sea between Kudat and Tawau is suitable for siting operation centres or sea-basings to boost defence and security on the east coast of Sabah, said former Lahad Datu police chief,

He said the location was suitable for stationing numerous equipment such as radar, helicopters and patrol and intercepting boats.

"The sea between Kudat and Tawau is suitable for sea-basing to site numerous equipment such as radar, patrol boats, intercepting boats and helicopter," he suggested when contacted by BERNAMA from Kuala Lumpur.

Kamis, who was formerly a police personnel with the rank of a superintendent, said the sea-basing system, namely, the stationing of military assets in the middle of the sea is capable of facilitating speedy security response.

Kamis also suggested that the government quickly set up an operation centre in the middle of the sea following the spate of kidnappings and intrusions by terrorists along the east coast of Sabah.

On May 9, Defence Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein said the ministry would submit a proposal to implement the sea-basing system to the Cabinet as soon as possible.

This was following the kidnapping of a China national, Yang Zai Lin, 34, a fish rearing centre manager on Pulau Baik, Lahad Datu by five armed men on May 6.

Earlier, on April 2, seven armed men abducted a tourist from China and a Filipino worker at a resort on Pulau Singgahmata, Semporna.

Of the same view with Kamis for the implementation of sea-basings to be speeded up was International and Strategic analyst from Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Prof Dr Ravichandran Moorthy.

He said the system was capable of functioning as an intelligence sharing centre and for implementation of national action.
