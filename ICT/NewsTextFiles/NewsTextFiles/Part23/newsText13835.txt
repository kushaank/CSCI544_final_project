
Beijing: Four ships tasked with evacuating Chinese nationals from anti-China riot-hit Vietnam arrived at the central Vung Ang port Monday.

The ship Wuzhishan, sailed into the port in the central Ha Tinh province at about 10 a.m, Xinhua reported.

"The other three Chinese ships, Baishiling, Tongguling and Zijing 12, also arrived in an area outside the port early Monday," Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Liu Jianchao said.

The Chinese government decided to send the ships to bring home nearly 4,000 Chinese nationals from Vietnam, who were attacked in anti-China violence over the past week.

Some 135 wounded Chinese workers in the Ha Tinh province were flown home aboard two chartered flights Sunday.

The Chinese government is working in collaboration with the Vietnamese authorities for the evacuation.

Violence erupted in Vietnam after China made renewed territorial claims over the Paracel Islands, which Vietnam insists are part of its territory.
