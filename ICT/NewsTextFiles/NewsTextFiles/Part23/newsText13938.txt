
Liberty Institute Attorneys File Lawsuit To Halt School District's Block on Prairie Valley Baptist Church's Bible Study Meetings; Attorneys Are Available For Interviews.

WHITNEY, Texas, May 19, 2014 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Today, Hill County 66th District Court granted Liberty Institute's petition for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), and thereby guaranteed that Prairie Valley Baptist Church may lead its after-school Christian Worldview Ministry in a Whitney High School classroom on Tuesday, May 20, and Tuesday, May 27, starting 30 minutes after the final bell has rung.  The church plans to immediately exercise its right to hold its Christian Worldview Bible study at Whitney High School.

"We are excited that the Christian Worldview Ministry, like other clubs, is welcome to meet after hours in Whitney ISD facilities—without government censorship," said Cleve Doty, Liberty Institute attorney. "Well-established federal and Texas law support the right of every citizen of Whitney to free speech and free exercise of religion."

Before receiving the TRO, Whitney ISD officials denied repeated requests by the church to hold its Christian Worldview Ministry Bible study meetings at Whitney High School—offering conflicting and contradictory explanation after explanation—in violation of Texas constitutional and statutory law.
