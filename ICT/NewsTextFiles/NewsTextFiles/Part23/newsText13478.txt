
China plans to cut reliance on local government financing vehicles for regional fundraising, according to a statement posted on the state council’s website.

Authorities will establish a local financing mechanism mainly based on government bonds, according to the statement drafted by the National Development & Reform Commission and approved by the State Council. The document, which didn’t give any further specifics on local financing plans, lays out tasks for deepening reforms of the country’s economic system in 2014.

Regional governments in the world’s most-populous nation have established more than 10,000 financing units to fund construction projects after they were barred from directly issuing bonds under a 1994 budget law. Local authorities are responsible for some 80 percent of spending while they get only about 40 percent of tax revenue, the legacy of a 1994 tax-sharing system, according to World Bank data.
