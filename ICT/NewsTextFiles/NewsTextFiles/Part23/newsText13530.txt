
BEIJING, May 19 (Yonhap) -- South Korean Trade Minister Yoon Sang-jick has said his government is willing to swiftly conclude bilateral negotiations with China for a free trade deal, suggesting that Seoul will take a "pragmatic" approach on sensitive issues.

Yoon made the remarks during a meeting with Chinese Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng on the sidelines of a two-day meeting of commerce ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) that ended on Sunday in China's eastern city of Qingdao, according to a statement posted on the website of the Chinese ministry.

"From a pragmatic point of view, South Korea is actively willing to speed up the process of negotiations to conclude an agreement as soon as possible," Yoon was quoted as telling Gao, according to the statement.

Yoon said South Korea "attaches a great importance" to the ongoing negotiations with China.

Gao told Yoon that China will "actively push for the negotiations with South Korea to promote healthy and sustainable development of trade and investment between the two nations."

South Korea and its biggest trading partner, China, began their formal free trade negotiations in May 2012. Since then, they have held 10 rounds of negotiations.

Agriculture and fisheries are considered to be the most sensitive sectors for South Korea, while China categorizes its manufacturing industries, which include the automobile, machinery and oil sectors, as sensitive.

Two-way trade between South Korea and China, Asia's fourth-largest and the world's second-largest economy, respectively, stood at US$256 billion last year, according to South Korean government data.

China will host this year's APEC summit, which draws heads of state from the group's 21-member economies, including South Korea.
