
Parts of the Proton-M type booster rocket carrying a communications satellite were scattered over Siberia and the Far East after it launched from Kazakhstan on Friday.

Russian space agency Roscosmos said an "emergency situation" prevented it going into orbit.

At about nine minutes into the flight at a height of about 150 km (94 miles), and parts of the satellite fell plummeted back to Earth.

The cost of the satelliteâ€™s loss was not immediately clear.

It was the first major accident involving a Proton-M rocket since last July, when three navigation satellites worth about $200 million were lost when the engines failed.

That accident strained relations between Kazakhstan and Russia, which are close political and trade allies, and Kazakhstan imposed a temporary ban on all Proton launches from its territory.
