As CQ Roll Call’s Rob Margetta writes, legislation intended to strengthen “information sharing between the private sector and federal agencies” has been stalled for years because of concerns “how much of a regulatory role government could play.” Shared information, however, did play a big part in this case, Margetta writes: “Officials said investigating the alleged hackers took extensive cooperation with the victimized companies. Eventually, they said, they were able to track the suspects to a single building in China.” Targets mentioned in the indictment include U.S. Steel, Westinghouse and Alcoa.
