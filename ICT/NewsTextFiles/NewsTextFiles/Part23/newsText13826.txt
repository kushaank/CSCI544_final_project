
KUALA LUMPUR: Bursa Malaysia opened lower Tuesday on profit-taking activity in select blue chip stocks.

However, analysts expect buying momentum to be sustained although with the market trading close to the overbought position, some profit-taking may come in.

RHB Retail Research analyst Mohammad Ashraf Abu Bakar said in a report that a close above 1,880 pts today should be enough to neutralise the weakness and confirm a breakout of the level on May 16.

“This will extend the upward move and the next resistance is at 1,890 points, followed by a stronger one at the round figure of 1,900 points,” he said.

Reuters reported that Asian markets got off to a subdued start as investors digested news of the declaration of martial law in Thailand despite Wall Street eking out gains following a largely flat trading day yesterday.

Investors also remained cautious of a slowdown in China as well as tension between China and Vietnam over territorial disputes in the South China Sea.

At Bursa Malaysia, Maybank fell one sen to RM9.97, Genting five sen to RM9.75 and Axiata two sen to RM6.98.

IOI Corp fell five sen to RM5.24 and TM six sen to RM6.52.

Gainers were MAS, up one sen to 16.5 sen and AAX rose three sen to 78.5 sen.
