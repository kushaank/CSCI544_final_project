
Hong Kong (HKSAR) - The Chief Executive, Mr C Y Leung, met the visiting Secretary of the CPC Jiangxi Provincial Committee, Mr Qiang Wei, at Government House this afternoon (May 19) to exchange views on issues of mutual concern.

Mr Leung said that Hong Kong is the premier conduit of foreign investment for Jiangxi and the two places enjoy close economic and trade ties. He also said that Hong Kong is an international financial and trade centre with a vibrant services sector which makes the city an ideal platform for Jiangxi enterprises to "go global".

Mr Leung said he hoped that Hong Kong and Jiangxi could continue to make use of the opportunities brought about by the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement to deepen the exchanges and co-operation in trade between the two places.
