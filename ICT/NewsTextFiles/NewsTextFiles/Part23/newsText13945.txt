
A street cleaning project with local youths in Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic, is aiming to promote cooperation and reconciliation between rival Christian and Muslim communities.

Thousands of people are believed to have been killed and hundreds of thousands of others forced to flee their homes across the country in the violence that began in 2012 and that has pitted those communities against each other.

Now the International Organization for Migration ( IOM) is bringing young Muslims and Christians together to work on rebuilding the physical and social fabric of their neighbourhood.

Jean-Pierre Ramazani has been speaking to the IOM's Sandra Black.
