
The Russian squadron consists of six battleships and support   vessels: the flagship of the Pacific Fleet, missile cruiser   Varyag, anti-submarine destroyer Admiral Panteleyev, large   landing ship Admiral Nevelskoy, anti-surface destroyer Bystry,   tanker Ilim and ocean tug Kalar.

The Chinese Navy will be represented in the naval drills with six   battleships.

All in all, during the active phase of the drills set for May   22-25, the maneuvers involve 14 ships, two submarines, nine   warplanes, six shipboard helicopters and two operational   detachments of marines from both sides.

All ships taking part in the training exercise are moored at the   Usun naval military base in Shanghai.

A delegation of Russian Navy officers has already joined their   Chinese colleagues to compare notes on the plan of the drills.

Chinese Vice Admiral Tian Zhong revealed to journalists that the   major difference of the starting drills will be the increased   difficulty of joint operations of battleships on both sides.

For the first time, Russian and Chinese sailors will operate   within a mixed group of battleship from the two counties, holding   joint missile and artillery strikes against sea targets at   different ranges and performing anti-submarine activities.

â€œAccumulated experience of interaction will allow us to   increase the possibility of conducting joint actions of the two   fleets to perform a wide range of tasks,â€� the top brass   Chinese naval officer said.

The crews of the Russian and Chinese warships made courtesy   visits on board each otherâ€™s battleships to learn more about   military hardware and service conditions.

Chinese officers will be given a formal reception on the Russian   flagship, the Varyag, on Monday evening.

Russian sailors not taking part in preparations have been taken   ashore for excursions organized by their Chinese hosts.

yup its true, China feels like its top dog,but even in their most crazy time they will not attack RF, they get from RF all that they need,and attacking RF will mean they get weakened while Japan and US get stronger..for this reason no way of any stupid acts from China toward RF..Without RF backing China its bad picture for Chinese..so all in all its a big plus plus for RF to become allies of new hegemony of our time-China..

To counter balance this world, even closer military ties with Peoples Republic of China and The Russian Federation would be to prefer. Seeing NATO expansionists and la, la land Cold War fanatics in the US bumping up their war drums to hide the real issues such as complete bankruptcy of the entire US economy and the Euro fall short after the US is pretty darn imminent. I'm just happy I live in a country with its own currency still. That will suffer from the US/EU crash but far, far, far from how much the US and the European Union member states will have to suffer, before they get something called an economy back.
