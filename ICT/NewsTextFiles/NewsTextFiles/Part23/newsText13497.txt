
Tehran, May 19, IRNA – Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei once again underlined that Beijing will continue to facilitate the process of negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear energy program.

“We will continue to contribute positive energy to pushing forward the negotiations,” Hong said in a press briefing in Beijing on Monday.

He further noted that Beijing hopes that Iran and the Group 5+1 (the five permanent UN Security Council members plus Germany) continue their talks based on an equal footing, and accommodate each otherˈs concerns.

Iran and the six countries have been discussing ways to remove differences and start drafting a final deal that would end the West’s dispute with Iran over the country’s nuclear energy program.

In November 2013, the two sides signed an interim nuclear deal in the Swiss city of Geneva that came into force on January 20.
