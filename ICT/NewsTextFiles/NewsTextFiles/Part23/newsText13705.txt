
Members of China's People's Liberation Army aren't just marching, they're also hacking into the computers of U.S. corporations, according to a Justice Department indictment.

The U.S. government hopes that its indictment of five Chinese Army officers for hacking into the computers of six U.S. companies and labor unions will send a message that America wonâ€™t tolerate state-sponsored cyber theft of trade secrets.

But itâ€™s unlikely these five officers will ever set foot in a U.S. court. Attorney General Eric Holder said he hopes China will cooperate with the U.S. on this criminal case â€” itâ€™s in Chinaâ€™s interest to be seen as a country that respects the rule of law.

Youâ€™ve got to suspect, however, that these officers, all working out of one building in Shanghai, had been ordered by higher-ups to steal everything from Westinghouseâ€™s design specifications for nuclear power plants to SolarWorldâ€™s communications with its attorneys about trade litigation against Chinese solar companies. So China has a lot to lose by turning these officers over to the U.S. for trial.

â€œThere are a range of things we can do, and we will deploy all of them,â€� Holder said at a news conference.

The attorney general didnâ€™t specify what those options are.

The best the U.S. can hope for in this case is that by taking this unprecedented step â€” charging a state actor for hacking the computers of U.S. corporations in order to benefit companies in its own country â€” will make China and other countries stop this criminal activity.

Besides Westinghouse and SolarWorld, there were four other victims in this particular case of cyber espionage: U.S. Steel, Alcoa , Allegheny Technologies Inc., and the United Steelworkers of America . The hacking led to production slowdowns and layoffs, because the cyber theft hurt their ability to compete, said David Hickton , U.S. attorney for the western district of Pennsylvania, who secured the indictment against the five Chinese Army officers.
