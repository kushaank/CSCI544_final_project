
The Czech-Vietnam Association (CVA) and Czech people strongly condemn China ’s illegal placement of an oil rig in Vietnamese waters and always support   Vietnam   in its sovereignty protection.

CVA Vice President Milos Kusy handed over the association’s statement opposing   China  ’s illegal act to President of the Ho Chi Minh City Union of Friendship Organisations Le Hung Quoc in the city on May 19.

This is not only  Vietnam ’s struggle against   China but also that for the right in the world, the statement said, adding that no country in the globe can break international law to realise its own intention.

The association made it clear that China’s act brazenly violated  Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone and seriously infringed international law and the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to which   China   is a signatory.

It also complicated the situation, caused instabilities and menaced maritime transport freedom in the   East   Sea  , thus threatening peace in the region and the world.

Therefore, the CVA strongly opposes and urges  China  to immediately stop its illegal acts and withdraw the rig and escort ships from   Vietnam  ’s waters, not letting similar actions reoccur in the future.

In its statement, the association affirmed its total support for the efforts and positive measures by the Vietnamese Government, authorised agencies and citizens to protect the nation’s legal sovereignty by peaceful means in line with international law.

At the meeting, Quoc said Vietnamese forces are now exercising their utmost restraint and patently calling for  China  to remove the rig and escort ships out of   Vietnam  ’s waters in a peaceful manner.
