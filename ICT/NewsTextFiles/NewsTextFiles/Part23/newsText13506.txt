
South Korean drama sensation Kim Soo-hyun is in Tokyo to promote his recent television series "My Love from the Star", which has been very successful in his home country.

South Korean drama sensation Kim Soo-hyun held a news conference in Tokyo on Monday during a promotional tour for his latest television series "My Love from the Star".

The 26-year old actor is the newest among the many South Korean star actors which have risen to pan-Asian fame.

The 21 episodes of his most recent series have gained huge popularity with a growing fan base in South Korea and China.

Kim attributed the success of his drama to the well-written screenplay and veteran actress Jun Ji-hyun, who co-starred as a celebrity solving a murder mystery in a science-fiction thriller where he played the part of a psychic from outer space.

"The success of the drama is purely because of the witty subjects the story involves and that it has been a comeback stage for my senior actress Jun Ji-hyun to the television screens," Kim told reporters.

Kim was in Japan on the last leg of his Asia tour which also took in Taiwan, China, Thailand, Singapore, and Indonesia.

Kim said his sudden international fame has given him new challenges to face.

"Thanks to the combination of those success factors, I had the honour of being able to meet my new fans during my Asian tour there. At the same time, the sudden fame gave me new challenges," he said without providing further explanation.

Kim encouraged Japanese viewers to watch the TV series, which he said have many "romantic scenes".

"The drama, 'My Love From the Star', features many kiss scenes between the main characters, and one of them was on a frozen lake where they kissed each other with time standing still. I wish you will all watch the romantic scene," Kim said.
