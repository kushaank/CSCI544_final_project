
Taiwan's laptop and mobile phone brand Asus can hardly beat its Chinese mobile phone competitor Xiaomi because it lacks the business model that Xiaomi is using to market its even more powerful gadgets at even lower prices, reports our sister newspaper China Times.

Wang Hsiao-chun, a Taiwanese businessman addicted to Asus gadgets, just spent over NT$20,000 (US$663) buying an Asus mobile phone, after using four laptops from the same brand.

He could only sigh in despair, however, when his "art masterpieces" were put next to a friend's Xiaomi mobile phone. For a cheaper price, his friend snatched up a more powerful operating system and better software.

Xiaomi's in-built photo function, for example, can help users identify the age of the subject in the photo, and make subjects look younger through special settings.

Wang said it is not because the quality of Asus is lower than Xiaomi. But the mindsets of these two company leaders are not the same, and have led to a different product.

Xiaomi started as a company that designs software, while Asus used to be a hardware manufacturer. Xiaomi is capable of updating its software more frequently according to the needs of its users, while Asus engineers design sleek hardware and let the marketing department do the rest, said Wang.

Xiaomi creates hype by hitting record sales at lightning speed. By doing so, the company saves money on inventory and tries to make the rest back on software sales. Asus not only has to store its gadgets, but also has to maintain its factories and thus cannot afford lowering the price of its gadgets.

By comparing these two companies, it is obvious that Asus is loosing ground against Xiaomi. If Asus wants to win back its market, it will have to switch strategies.
