HANOI--China began evacuating nationals from Vietnam on ships Monday even as a Vietnamese official said nearly all foreign-owned factories damaged in last week's anti-Chinese riots near Ho Chi Minh City were back to normal operations.

Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua said Monday that the first of four ships had left the port in Ha Tinh province on Monday with 989 evacuees.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said in Beijing on Monday that security in Vietnam has deteriorated, and warned the Association of Southeast Asian Nations against taking sides in a dispute over an oil rig that China put in waters that it and Vietnam claim.

Mr. Hong repeated notices issued Sunday that China was advising against travel to Vietnam and was suspending unspecified diplomatic exchanges.

"Due to the violent incidents in Vietnam against foreign enterprises and personnel, the security situation there has worsened dramatically. China cannot but suspend some bilateral exchanges," Mr. Hong said at a daily media briefing in Beijing. "We will make specific decisions in accordance with the development of the situation."

While the row started over the oil rig, protests turned deadly last week, when riots broke out in industrial parks in the south and central parts of Vietnam, leading to arson and looting of not only Chinese factories, but Taiwanese, South Korean and other foreign-owned factories as well. Two Chinese nationals were killed and more than 140 others were injured.

Tran Van Nam, deputy chairman of Binh Duong province near Ho Chi Minh City, said Monday he has reassured foreign businesses that order has been restored, adding that more than 90% of foreign-owned businesses damaged last week had resumed operations.

Meanwhile, state television reported Monday that operations at the Taiwanese Formosa steel mill in Ha Tinh in central Vietnam, where the two Chinese nationals were killed, had returned to normal.

"I have been working with the affected businesses over the recent days, and I have assured them that there will be no more violence and that they can continue doing business in the province," Mr. Nam said.

In Binh Duong, workers on Monday swept debris, clearing glass scattered from windows broken in last week's rampage. Vietnam Singapore Industrial Park JV Co. Ltd., the operator of two industrial parks there, said on Monday that more than 80% of its tenants had resumed operations.

Phan Thi Dung, a human resource official with Song Tain Industrial, a Taiwanese-owned bicycle factory, estimated damage to her company in the province's Song Than II Industrial Park, at 67 billion Vietnamese dong ($3.2 million).

Do Nhat Hoang, head of Vietnam's Foreign Investment Agency, said Monday that the authorities were assessing the damage and working with insurance companies on compensation.

"The Vietnamese government will also have necessary measures to support the affected factories, but we haven't made a decision on how to compensate yet," Mr. Hoang said. "There could be many ways, but that will be decided by the National Assembly or the prime minister."

Meanwhile, Mr. Hong of China took issue with comments last week by Asean Secretary-General Le Luong Minh, whose 10 members include Vietnam. Mr. Minh, a Vietnamese national, said China needed to leave Vietnam's territorial waters to restore confidence in talks to resolve the maritime disputes.

Mr. Hong criticized Mr. Minh, without naming him, and said Asean was being used by Vietnam. "The relevant person ignores the facts concerning the issue of the South China Sea and violates the neutrality of Asean, unilaterally propagandizes the claim of an individual country and emits the wrong signal to the outside world," said Mr. Hong.

He reiterated Beijing's position that Vietnam is to blame for the current troubles and suggested that relations between China and Asean could suffer if the group took Hanoi's side.

"Maritime friction between China and Vietnam is caused by the forceful disruption of the Vietnamese side against China's normal drilling activities," said Mr. Hong. He added that Asean should "not get involved in this specific dispute and take concrete actions to maintain the friendly cooperation between China and Asean."

China evacuated thousands more of its citizens from Vietnam even as a Vietnamese official said nearly all foreign-owned factories damaged in last week's anti-Chinese riots near Ho Chi Minh City were back to normal operations.

Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua said Monday that the first of four ships had left the port in Ha Tinh province on Monday with about 1,000 evacuees. At least 3,000 had left by Saturday, Xinhua reported.
