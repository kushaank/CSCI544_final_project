
Arthur Sulzberger, chairman of the New York Times Co., praised Jill Abramson yesterday as a fighter for freedom of the press, a week after dismissing her as the newspaper’s top editor.

Sulzberger, also publisher of the New York Times, spoke at a First Amendment Awards dinner last night hosted by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. He was being honored at the New York event and spoke just hours after Abramson delivered a commencement address at Wake Forest University. It was the first public appearance for each since the firing.

Abramson, the first woman to run the Times as executive editor in its 162-year history, was abruptly ousted on May 14 following a fraught relationship with Sulzberger.

Dean Baquet, the new executive editor of the Times, said he wished the dismissal of his predecessor hadn’t created such a firestorm.

Baquet praised Abramson’s speech.

“I think she was great this morning,” said Baquet, who is the first African-American executive editor at the newspaper.

Abramson, 60, told graduates at the Winston-Salem, North Carolina, campus yesterday that she knows “the sting of losing.” When that happens, “show what you are made of,” she said.

Don Graham, chairman of Graham Holdings Co., which sold the Washington Post to Jeff Bezos last year, introduced Sulzberger at the awards dinner. He credited Sulzberger with adapting the newspaper to the Internet and upholding its standards.
