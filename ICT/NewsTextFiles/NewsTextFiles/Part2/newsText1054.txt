
There is no beef in Central African Republic. How an entire country ran out of red meat is a complicated story of bloodshed, poaching, and religious strife.

When conflict erupted last year, Muslim fighters called Seleka began targeting Christians, leaving hundreds dead. Christians formed their own self-defense groups, called anti-Balaka, and began reprisals against the Seleka fighters, many of whom fled the country, and later against the general Muslim population. Herders—of cattle and other livestock—in Central African Republic are generally Muslim. So the Christian anti-Balaka began taking cattle and selling it on the open market. There was a glut on the market, and beef was ridiculously cheap for a while. Many of the cattle were taken out of the country when herders fled to Chad, Cameroon, or Sudan.

“In Somalia you have charcoals, weapons, ivory, rhino horn—these are the money makers for al-Shabab,” says Kalron. “Here in CAR they have diamonds and gold and wood and ivory, arms and bush meat.” Bush meat is a catchall term for wild animals that are hunted and eaten in Africa.

The animals can attest to that.
