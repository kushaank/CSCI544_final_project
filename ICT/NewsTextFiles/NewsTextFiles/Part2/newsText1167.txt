The upcoming month-long celebration of all things “face” being organised by the Bega Chamber of Commerce has announced the inclusion of the “Show Us Your Selfies” competition.

The competition is being organised and run by Adult Education students, with some great prizes on offer including cameras and photography books.

Adult Ed Certificate III and IV business administration students Sally Telford, Dale McCoy and Camille Hossack visited business around Bega last week to promote their idea, developed as a course project with the idea of involving youth in the festival.

Ms Hossack said throughout the Festival of the Face – being held in June to coincide with the Shirley Hannan National Portrait Award – entries in the Show Us Your Selfies competition will be displayed on screens in Betta Home Living, Fletcher’s Fotographics and Candelo Books.

As well as official judging, there will also be a people’s choice winner, who will receive a Polaroid camera thanks to Fletcher’s.

The overall winning selfie will score a camera worth $550 also from Fletcher’s.

In a selfie sub-category, any taken that includes your favourite read purchased at Candelo Books could be in the running for $600 worth of art and photography books.

The competition will run from May 30 until June 28, with winners to be announced at the Festival of the Face grand finale.

Ms Hossack said supporters of the competition include Bega Adult Ed, Bega Chamber of Commerce, Fletcher’s Fotographics, Betta Home Living, Candelo Books, Sportspower and Magpie Music.
