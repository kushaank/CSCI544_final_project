
Labour unions representing workers in Thai state firms have called for a strike this week to force the government out, siding with street protesters who have been trying for six months to get a new Prime Minister appointed.

The State Enterprises Workers’ Relations Confederation, whose members come from around 20 state firms, said its members would strike from Thursday in sympathy with the protesters, who say they are making one last push to oust the government.

The unions would join anti-government protesters from the People’s Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC) to try to remove acting Prime Minister Niwatthamrong Boonsongphaisan and would take part in street rallies.

Mr Sirichai Mai-ngam, president of the union at the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), said his union would not be striking, but would join the protests this week. “We will definitely join the PDRC, but it will not involve any stoppage. This will not affect any operations of EGAT and we will not shut down,” he said.

Unionisation in the country is low and mostly limited to the public sector.

Transport Minister Chadchart Sittipunt asked state employees yesterday not to take part in the strike.

Throughout the anti-government demonstrations in the past few months, salaried employees from state enterprises have backed the campaign, alongside supporters from Bangkok’s middle class.

Staff from national flag carrier Thai Airways gathered in their hundreds to receive protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban when he dropped by its Bangkok headquarters last month.
