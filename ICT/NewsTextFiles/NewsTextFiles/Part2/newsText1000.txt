
DETROIT — Tony Cervone is returning to General Motors as SVP of global communications, reporting directly to CEO Mary Barra.

In his new post, effective immediately,  Cervone will have overall responsibility for GM’s global communications, including global products and brands, corporate, social media, executive support and internal communications.

Last month, GM parted ways with comms chief Selim Bingol amid a management shakeup that followed the recall of nearly 2.6m cars as a result of an ignition switch defect that GM says was known to engineers since 2001. The defect has been linked to 13 deaths.
