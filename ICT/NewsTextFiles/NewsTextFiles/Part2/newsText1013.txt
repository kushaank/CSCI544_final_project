
Prime Minister John Key will meet with US President Barack Obama in Washington DC next month.

In a statement Key says he "has welcomed" an invitation to meet with Obama. Key will catch up with Obama in Washington DC on Friday, June 20.

“The invitation underlines the very close relationship between the United States and New Zealand," says Key.

“I look forward to meeting with President Obama. We are likely to discuss the Trans Pacific Partnership negotiations, to take stock of our bilateral relationship, and to exchange views on current regional and international issues,” says Key.

Key, facing an election on September 20, will visit the US from June 16 to 20.

When in Washington DC, he will also meet with senior Obama administration figures, Congressional representatives and business leaders. Key will also visit New York to support New Zealand’s bid to win a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council for 2015-16.
