
KINGSTON HULL: Malaysiaâ€™s Nicol David gained some compensation for the loss of her world title in her home state of Penang last month by regaining the British Open in Laura Massaroâ€™s native country on Sunday.

David, the world number one, won 8-11, 11-5, 11-7, 11-8 against Englandâ€™s world champion Massaro, who beat her in last yearâ€™s British Open final, played outdoors at the same venue.â€œI am so pleased -- it means the world to me. It was so close -- there wasnâ€™t much in it,â€� said David after winning her fifth British Open title and first since 2012.

There was further English disappointment in the menâ€™s final where Franceâ€™s world number one Gregory Gaultier produced a stunning performance to outplay world champion Nick Matthew 11-3, 11-6, 11-2.
