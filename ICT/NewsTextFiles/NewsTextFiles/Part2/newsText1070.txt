
A recent survey by Egypt's state polling centre showed that the number of Egyptians who say they will vote in the country's upcoming presidential elections has dropped by almost 10 percent in just one week.

According to the survey from the Egyptian Centre for Public Opinion Research (Baseera), 80 percent said they will vote on 26-27 May – down from 88 percent a week ago.

Twelve percent said they will boycott the vote, while 8 percent said they are undecided.

More than half – 62 percent – of those who said they will vote stated that they haven't heard anything yet about the candidates' electoral programmes.

Meanwhile, support for the poll's leading candidate – former army chief Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi – dropped to 69 percent, as compared to 75 percent in Baseera's poll last week.

Out of those who said they will vote for El-Sisi, most (23 percent) said their decision is because they think he's most qualified to lead Egypt at the current time or because he's a military man (17 percent).

Support for the El-Sisi's rival – Nasserist politician Hamdeen Sabahi – remained at 2 percent.

Sabahi's supporters said they will choose him because of his presidential programme (21 percent), his common-man status (17 percent) or that he's not a military candidate (18 percent). A small number – 6 percent – said they will vote for Sabahi because he sympathises with the poor.

Undecided voters jumped to 18 percent from 15 percent, while those who didn't want to say who they're going to vote for increased to 11 percent from 7 percent.

Other findings from the Baseera survey showed that 68 percent believe the upcoming elections will be fair.
