
NEW YORK: Jurors in the New York trial of British hate preacher Abu Hamza on Monday found him guilty of kidnapping and terrorism offenses.

The former imam of the north London Finsbury Park mosque, real name Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, showed no reaction to the verdict, which carries a possible life sentence. He is to be sentenced September 9.

The charges against him pre-dated the 9/11 attacks on New York and were over the 1998 abduction of 16 Western tourists in Yemen, four of whom were killed in a military rescue operation.

He was also accused of trying to set up a terrorist training camp in the United States in 1999, and of promoting â€œviolent jihadâ€� on a global scale.

The jury deliberated for 12 hours over two days before reaching a verdict, after a four-week trial in which Abu Hamza took the stand for three days of testimony in his own defense.

Blind in one eye and with no hands after an accidental explosion in Pakistan , the 56-year-old had denied all the charges, though he acknowledged he occasionally used strong words in his sermons and fiery speeches â€“ numerous extracts of which were played for the jury.

He admitted supplying a satellite to the militant group that kidnapped the Western tourists in Yemen, but said he was only told of the abduction after the fact.

He also said he threw in the trash a fax in which a young man who attended his mosque told him of plans to build a jihad training camp in Oregon in 1999.

He said he didn't know another of the young men at his mosque had left to fight in Afghanistan.

Abu Hamza, a father of nine and an engineer by training, became the imam at Finsbury Park in 1997, where he preached vitriolic sermons, in particular against the United States.

The mosque closed in 2003.

Abu Hamza was arrested in August 2004 in Britain at Washington's request, and sentenced in a British court to seven years in jail in 2006 for inciting murder and racial hatred. He was extradited to the United States in October 2012.

Well done, US justice system.  Keep him locked up for life.  Good riddance.

Judge, Jury and executioner, what an amazing standard of American justice.

@Israr Khan Ismailzai  We have same thing in Pakistan . Any convict of blasphemy punished right away . But Even in America any criminal with money got the pass. Money is power just hire top notch attorney.

@Israr Khan Ismailzai At least there was a judge and a jury.  He was granted a pulpit to defend himself.  In our homeland, our own masses wish they ever make it to the courts to get justice.  Justice is non existent and that is why you have people seeking justice elsewhere i.e. Taliban.  Talk about being between a rock and a hard place!

He is not guilty. He has done nothing wrong. He is free to go. He is also free to give fierry speeches again and make thousands others killed in the name of Jihad. He is a pious man. But Abu Hamza, you are not in Pakistan. You are in USA and you have to pay for your crimes.

Good to hear that. Such people must not be allowed to flourish in any part of the world. In the guise of Islamic preaching they spread their evil ideology of hate and destruction thus bringing bad name to Islam. They have nothing to do with any preaching of Islam.

Look at the man who brought lots and lots shame for ISLAM.

@Israr Khan Ismailzai That is not true.  The US justice system actually works.  That is why this criminal is going to be put behind bars whereas in Pakistan where thousands have been killed by terrorists and the courts have failed to punish even one.

There are no nasty lawyers in US to shower Abu Hamza with rose petals.
