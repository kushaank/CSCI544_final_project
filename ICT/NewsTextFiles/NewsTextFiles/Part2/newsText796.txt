
PACIFIC Sun will receive its brand new ATR 72-600 aircraft early next month.

This is also when the domestic and regional carrier will be officially rebranded as Fiji Link.

In a statement, Pacific Sun general manager Shaenaz Voss said preparations were in progress for the transition to Fiji Link, especially with the addition of a larger ATR aircraft type to their fleet.

"Our ATR fleet captain Manu Rajappa completed the difference course in Singapore and the other pilots are doing the same," she said.

"The pilot corps will be ready to begin operating the ATR 72 aircraft as soon as it begins commercial flights in mid-June."

As part of preparations, Ms Voss said 11 Pacific Sun pilots were undergoing a complete difference course training for the ATR 72, which would finish at the end of this week.

The brand new twin-engine turbo prop aircraft will have a seating capacity for 68 passengers, and will be used to operate Fiji's larger domestic ports of Nadi, Suva and Labasa.

It will operate regionally to Samoa, Tonga and Funafuti, on behalf of parent company Fiji Airways.

"There are two sets of training and include differences training from a 42-500 to 72-600 series, flight simulator and various ground courses."
