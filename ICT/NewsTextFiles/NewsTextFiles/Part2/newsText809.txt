
A teacher at a UK school, believed to be controlled by Muslim radicals, has broken into a studentâ€™s phone to prove she was having a â€œforbiddenâ€� relationship with a boy. The school reportedly segregates boys and girls and encourages fasting before exams.

The 16-year-old studentâ€™s mother has contacted the police over   the matter, maintaining her daughter did not give her permission   for the phone to be taken, reports UK newspaper, the Telegraph . Two members of staff at Park View   School in Birmingham told the publication that one of the   teachers stole the device and had it specially unblocked last   month.

Photos of the girl and a fellow year-11 student as well as text   messages were then used as evidence to convict them of being in a â€œforbiddenâ€� relationship. Shortly afterwards, the girl   was suspended from Park View School a couple of weeks prior to   her end-of-year exams.

â€œThis was an appalling act of bullying and invasion of   privacy,â€� said a staff member to the Telegraph, adding the   teacher involved was part of a â€œmoral policeâ€� force,   imposing Muslim values on students.

In addition, the Telegraph writes pupils were encouraged to   compete in a â€œRamadan competition,â€� sparking concern   among some teachers who felt the childrenâ€™s health and ability to   learn would be harmed by an 18-hour fast.

â€œPupils were starving themselves all day at a stressful time   and then had an iftar [meal breaking the fast] in the evening in   school, with prayers for the exams,â€� a member of staff said   to the publication.

Muslims are expected to observe a month-long fast from sunrise   until sunset during the festival of Ramadan. Children are not   usually required to participate.

Ofsted, the UKâ€™s official body for investigating schools, and the   Department of Education are currently looking at 18 schools in   the Birmingham area that are thought to have been taken over by   Muslim hardliners. Birmingham City Council has also launched its   own probe into 25 schools.

Ofstedâ€™s findings are expected to be published later this month   in a report. Director of Birminghamâ€™s childrenâ€™s services, Peter   Hay, has predicted a â€œbloody firestormâ€� when the report   emerges and â€œpotential significant structural proposals,â€�   reported the Telegraph.

The investigations come in response to allegations of a so-called   Trojan horse plot, where Muslim teachers are attempting to gain   influence in Birmingham schools and remove staff members who are   not sympathetic to their religious beliefs.

RTâ€™s Sara Firth spoke to a former teacher at Park View in April   who said such practices had been going on in the school for   years.

â€œThe local authority knew about it and did nothing. They were   prepared to see Park View School become a prison in its own   community,â€� said Michael White who was dismissed from the   school in 1993.

The National Union of Teachers (NUT) has called for greater   sensitivity in the ongoing investigations, amid fears of a   possible demonization of the Muslim population of Birmingham.   NUTâ€™s executive member for Birmingham, Roger King, said that he   had heard no such reports of boy-girl segregation in Birmingham   schools.

"We've never had any of that kind of concern come to us, and   I would have thought that if those things were going on, they   would have been brought to us,â€� he said at an annual NUT   conference in Brighton in April.

Birmingham is the UKâ€™s second largest city, with a population of   over 1 million, 22 percent of which is Muslim, according to the   2011 census.
