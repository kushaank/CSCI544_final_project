
FORT MYERS BEACH, FL - We're learning more about Marilyn Speigel – who was killed last week on Fort Myers Beach with her fiance Harry Carlip just days before their wedding.

Relatives of Spiegel say she was a former teacher and described her as an education advocate.

Spiegel’s sister was going to officiate the ceremony Saturday on Lover’s Key. Now, she’s trying to cope with the loss.

“I know that probably most people say ‘oh this person was wonderful.’ People told Marilyn this while she was alive because she was that unique, and wonderful, and loving and warm,” said Susan Homan, Speigel’s sister.

Spiegel is scheduled to be laid to rest Wednesday in Broward County. Homan says the Carlips’ requested a Navy burial at sea.

70-year-old Michael Spiegel, Marilyn’s ex-husband, is accused of murdering her and Carlip.

Marilyn  and Harry were killed onboard the boat in which they planned to spend the rest of their lives together.

We have uncovered that the man who sold them their dream boat last October also tried to help them stay hidden.

Marilyn Spiegel first saw the boat while in the keys. The man who sold it to her helped find her a marina where her and her fiance could stay safe from from her ex-husband.

But Wednesday morning Spiegel found out where the couple was. Witnesses say he came Wednesday to scope them out, then investigators say he returned Thursday with a brief case holding a gun, knife, ties and sex toys.

Michel Spiegel is facing two charges of first-degree murder and is being held on no bond at the Lee County Jail. He is due back in court in June.
