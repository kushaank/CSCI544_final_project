Dennis Bitters, chief of the Ripon Consolidated Fire District, said one of the teams returned on Sunday and the other was en route this morning.

The teams were compâ€‹osed of 38 firefighters, most of them from both rural and urban departments in San Joaquin County.

Better weather down south helped firefighters beat down the flames quickly, preventing the need for an extended stay, Bitters said.
