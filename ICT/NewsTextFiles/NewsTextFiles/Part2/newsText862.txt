
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated, during talks with his Slovak counterpart Miroslav Lajcak, that Russiaâ€™s relations with the EU and NATO need to be reviewed.

â€œWe will discuss international affairs, including the   European situation, on what is happening in relations between   Russia and the EU, and in the NATO-Russia Council in regard to   the crisis in Ukraine,â€� Lavrov said in the talks with   Lajcak, who arrived in Russia on a working visit on Sunday.

â€œThese relations require essential rethinking, and with both   our partners in the European Union and with NATO member states we   are trying to conduct an analysis in order to better understand   where we are, what our coinciding assessments are, and where we   have disagreements,â€� Lavrov added.

During the meeting, Lavrov also spoke out about the detention of   two Russian journalists by Kievâ€™s military on Sunday, demanding   their immediate release.

â€œWe are concerned that during combat actions, which are led   by [Ukrainian] armed forces with the participation of radicals,   extremists, militants of the Right Sector and other groups, some   journalists are suffering. Very often they are detained, faced   with fictitious demands, which do not fit into generally   recognized norms. The latter concerns two journalists from the LifeNews channel,â€� Lavrov stated.

The rhetoric follows NATO foreign ministers saying last month   they were suspending practical cooperation and military ties with   Russia over the Ukrainian crisis. However, the contacts of the   NATO-Russia Council (NRC) at the level of ambassadors and higher   would continue, the bloc stated.

Russian officials have repeatedly said that Moscow was not   seeking confrontation with NATO, but was ready to take all   political and military measures to ensure its security.

Since March, the US and EU have imposed targeted sanctions   against Russian officials, freezing their assets and banning them   from obtaining visas; this includes action against 17 Russian   companies.

Moscow has repeatedly declared that the language of sanctions is "inappropriate and counterproductive" and warned its   Western partners about the "boomerang effect" that   sanctions would have.
