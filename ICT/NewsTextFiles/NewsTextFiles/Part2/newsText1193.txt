CANBERA (Alliance News) - The yen weakened against the other major currencies in early Asian deals on Monday following an unexpected surge in Japan machinery orders in March.

Core machine orders in Japan surged a seasonally adjusted 19.1% on month in March, the Cabinet Office said today - worth 936.7 billion yen.

The headline figure shattered forecasts for a 6.0% increase following the upwardly revised 4.6% contraction in February (originally -8.8%).

On a yearly basis, core machine orders spiked 16.1% - also blowing past forecasts for an increase of 4.3% following the 10.8% gain in the previous month.

The yen slipped to 4-day low of 87.89 against the NZ dollar, from last week's closing quote of 87.53. The next possible downside target of the yen is seen at 88.78.

Against the US and Australian dollars, the yen fell to 101.59 and 95.20. If the yen extends fall, it is likely to find support around 102.47 against the U.S dollar and 96.25 against the Australian dollar.

Against the Canadian dollar and Swiss franc, the yen fell to 93.51 and 113.89, from last week's closing quotes of 93.40 and 113.65, respectively. If the yen extends its downtrend, it is likely to find support around 94.00 against the Canadian dollar and 115.62 against the Swiss franc.

The yen slipped to 139.19 against the euro and 170.94 against the pound, from last week's closing quotes of 138.98 and 170.63, respectively. The next possible downside target of the yen is seen at 141.19 against the euro and 172.86 against the pound.
