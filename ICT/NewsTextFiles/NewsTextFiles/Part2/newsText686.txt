
Popular Chinese smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi is taking one step further in its overseas expansion plans as it announced today that it is landing in Malaysia, with its Mi 3 flagship smartphone going on sale tomorrow. The 16GB version of the Mi 3 will retail for RM889 ($277) unlocked. To mark the launch of Xiaomi’s handsets in Malaysia, the company has also released a custom theme in its store that can be used on MIUI , its highly-customizable firmware based on Android.

Xiaomi promises the release of more products in Malaysia soon. The Redmi 1S , Xiaomi’s budget Android phone that boasts updated specs compared to its predecessor, the Redmi, will land in Malaysia next month — and should be making its appearance in Singapore around the same time too. Xiaomi first moved beyond Greater China in February when it launched the Redmi in Singapore , before going on to release the Mi 3 there as well.

The Malaysia launch comes after  Xiaomi revealed last month that it will be expanding into 10 more countries this year — starting with Malaysia, the Philippines, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, followed by Russia, Turkey, Brazil and Mexico. To help propel its plans, Xiaomi also  simplified its Web domain to Mi.com as it seeks to appeal to an international audience.
