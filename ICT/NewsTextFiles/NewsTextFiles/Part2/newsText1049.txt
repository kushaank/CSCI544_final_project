
THE importance of knowing who you sell your grain to in a deregulated market has been highlighted by the recent Sapphire Pty Ltd insolvency case.

The company - which traded as River City Grain Co and AG Commodity Trading and based at Murray Bridge - was put into administration in March, through Anthony Matthews & Associates.

After a creditors meeting in Adelaide last week, it was announced that unsecured creditors, including many growers in SA, Vic and NSW, would receive only 20 per cent of their money in two years.

Many growers are believed to be owed between $50,000 and $100,000, with some debts running into the hundreds of thousands.

Creditors committee member and Vic grower Stuart Ellis, Burrumbeet, said they would now be looking to pursue legal action against the now-defunct company and its director Brenton Strauss, and seeking funding help from the National Farmers Federation.

A report from the administrator Anthony Matthews & Associates showed Sapphire Pty Ltd's liabilities at the time of going into administration totalled $13 million, with unsecured creditors owed $6m.

The company's records disclosed a trading loss of $1.5m for the period from October 1, 2013 to September 30, 2013, and a trading loss of $5.9m from October 1, 2012 to September 30, 2013.

Sapphire was described as 'hopelessly insolvent' with company employees owed about $60,000.

At a creditors meeting in March, NAB's Brent Musgrove questioned Mr Strauss' involvement in a new company. The NAB are listed as being owed $5.26m in the report.
