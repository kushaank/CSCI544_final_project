
Dubai’s benchmark index headed for the biggest drop in nine months amid investor bets that gains related to the MSCI Inc. upgrade next month are overdone.

The DFM General Index (DFMGI) declined 4.2 percent, the most since Aug. 27, to 4,922.55 at 12:37 p.m. in Dubai. That made the gauge the worst performer among more than 90 benchmarks tracked by Bloomberg globally. Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the developer of the world’s tallest tower, slid 5.4 percent, Deyaar Development PJSC, whose quarterly profit almost tripled, tumbled 6.4 percent and Union Properties PJSC (UPP) lost 6.1 percent.

Dubai’s gauge has more than doubled in the past 12 months as index provider MSCI said it would reclassify the United Arab Emirates to emerging market status from frontier and helped by a resurgence in real estate prices. The MSCI move may attract more than $905 million to stocks in the country, HSBC Holdings Plc said in a note to investors last week.

Emaar tumbled the most since Sept. 3 to 9.7 dirhams, trimming the advance this year to 40 percent. Deyaar retreated to 1.31 dirhams and Union Properties declined to 2.15 dirhams.

MSCI, whose gauges are tracked by investors managing about $8 trillion in assets, on May 14 named companies from the U.A.E. and Qatar including Emaar to its developing-markets gauge.

Qatar’s index retreated 0.8 percent and Abu Dhabi ’s benchmark lost 1.9 percent.
