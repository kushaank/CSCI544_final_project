
Nigel Farage has defended the comments he made about Romanian people in a car-crash interview with LBC last week, insisting that “Ukip is not a racist party”.

After he told BBC News that he had been “tired” when he made the radio appearance last week, the party has now taken out a full-page advert in a national newspaper featuring “an open letter” from its leader.

Yet today the party appeared to be back on the offensive. In an advert in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Farage again quoted crime figures about Romanians, saying that they commit “92 per cent of all ATM crime in London”.

“The vast majority of Romanians who have come to the UK wish to better their lives and would make good neighbours,” he wrote.

Citing issues of organised crime and the social exclusion of the Roma minority in Eastern Europe, Mr Farage went on to say: “We should not be in a political union with Romania, with an opened door to all of their citizens. We must take back the power to stop criminals from entering our country by taking back control of our borders.

Mr Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show yesterday that after a difficult week for Ukip “the mask is starting to slip”.

He said: “I think what's being revealed that sort of behind the beer-swilling bonhomie is a rather nasty view of the world.

On Friday, as well as the bruising LBC interview, the party was forced to cancel its Freephone number after it received so many calls from protesters deliberately trying to push up the party’s costs.
