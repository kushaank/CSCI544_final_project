
US President Barack Obama will meet New Zealand Prime Minister John Key next month at the White House over bilateral and regional issues, the White House said Monday.

The June 20 meet "will highlight our increasingly close relationship with New Zealand and our collaboration on the Trans- Pacific Partnership, climate change, and military-to-military cooperation", Xinhua quoted White House spokesperson Jay Carney as saying in a statement.

He said other topics of discussion will include ongoing U.S. rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region, regional maritime security issues and global security issues like Ukraine.

Key visited the White House in July 2011.
