Dallas-based Tenet Healthcare Corp. has signed a multiyear contract extension with insurance provider Cigna to grant its customers in-network access to all of Tenetâ€™s services and facilities. That includes Tenetâ€™s 77 hospitals, 190 outpatient centers and more than 1,500 employed physicians.

The Cigna agreement includes a pay-for-quality arrangement that rewards Tenet (NYSE: THC) hospitals for improved quality of care and cost efficiency. During the first year, that will be based on national quality measures established by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The arrangement is the first of its kind between Cigna and a healthcare system.

Last year, Tenet struck a deal valued at $4.3 billion to acquire Nashville-based Vanguard Health Systems which operates several hospitals in San Antonio.
