
The Indiana Commission for Higher Education is slated to vote today on $2 million in state funding for planning costs associated with the proposed Indiana University School of Medicine campus in downtown Evansville. A previous vote was postponed because not enough commission members were present.

It has already received the recommendation of the commission during its 2013-2015 budget process.

The campus will be a collaboration among Indiana University School of Medicine, Ivy Tech Community College, University of Southern Indiana and University of Evansville.

Indiana University's board of trustees last month recommended the downtown Evansville site for the proposal, which includes a five-story tower.
