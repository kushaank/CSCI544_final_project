
FELTON &GT;&GT; Two strike teams of Santa Cruz County firefighters returned Sunday after fighting Southern California wildfires.

A team that left Santa Cruz County on Thursday helped fight the Cocos wildfire, which burned nearly 2,000 acres in San Marcos in San Diego County, according to Cal Fire.

The team included firefighters from Central, Aptos, Scotts Valley, Branciforte, Zayante and Felton fire agencies. The Cocos fire was 91 percent contained as of 7 p.m. Monday, according to Cal Fire.

Last week, a separate Cal Fire strike team from Santa Cruz County also battled another San Diego County wildfire. That team also returned Sunday, said Cal Fire Capt. Gary Silva.
