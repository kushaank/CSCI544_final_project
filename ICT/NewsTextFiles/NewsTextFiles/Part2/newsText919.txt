Paul Duncan, of Christiansburg, and Gary Duncan, of Salem, have earned the 2014 Chancellor’s Award for Leadership in Philanthropy. They were nominated for the award by New River Community College (NRCC). The award was given at a luncheon ceremony at the Country Club of Virginia last month and attended by representatives from Virginia’s 23 community colleges and their Chancellor’s Award recipients.

The father and son team have long been friends of NRCC and most recently donated a parcel of land near the college’s Dublin campus to the NRCC Educational Foundation Inc.

With more than 100 years in the automobile industry between them, Paul and Gary Duncan’s successful working relationship in the Duncan Automotive Network has branded their name with friendship, trust and excellence in the New River Valley.

Living their “brand” every day, the father and son have turned customers into treasured friends over the years, and employees into members of their family.

Just as it was 40 years ago when Gary was a community college student, the affordability of a community college education still appeals to him. And, he hopes his family’s support of NRCC will help build the automotive program. “The community college is important,” he said, stating the automotive industry needs fewer mechanics and more technicians.

The Chancellor’s Award for Leadership in Philanthropy luncheon is hosted by the Virginia Foundation for Community College Education (VFCCE) to honor the leading philanthropists from each of Virginia’s 23 community colleges as well as the statewide foundation. This marks the ninth year the awards have been given.

This year’s class of distinguished philanthropy leaders has contributed a combined total of more than $12 million dollars to Virginia’s Community Colleges.
