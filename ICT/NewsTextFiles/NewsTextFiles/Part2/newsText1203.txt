
BEIJING, May 18  -- Major Chinese travel agencies have suspended their Vietnam tour services following the recent deadly violence targeting foreign nationals and businesses in Vietnam.

The Ctrip.com, a major online travel service provider in China, confirmed to Xinhua on Sunday that it has suggested clients planning Vietnam traveling to suspend their trips.

Those who have signed up or booked for Vietnam journeys via the company will have all their payment refunded, the company said.

Over the last week, the China National Tourism Administration has reposted several notices from China's foreign affairs authorities that warned of security risks to Chinese tourists to Vietnam.

Other major agencies, including Caissa and the China International Travel Service, have also suspended relevant tours.
