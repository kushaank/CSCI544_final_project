
During the meeting, Iranian Justice Minister Mostafa Pour Mohammadi and Iraqi Judiciary Chief Medhet Al-Mahmoud explored avenues for bolstering and reinvigorating mutual cooperation.

Pour Mohammadi pointed to his recent visit to Iraq, and said, "During this visit I closely witnessed the favorable parliamentary election atmosphere in Iraq and I believe that this election was another wide stride towards independence, development and reinvigoration of Iraq.

The Iraqi judiciary chief, for his part, said that during his meetings with Iranian officials he has realized Tehran's strong willingness for expanding ties with Iraq.

Al-Mahmoud pointed to the separate legal and judicial agreements signed between Iran and Iraq, and said, "Now our duty is implementing these agreements in a bid to enable the two countries' citizens to benefit from it."

Iran and Iraq have enjoyed growing ties ever since the overthrow of the former Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein, during the 2003 US invasion of the Muslim country.

Last month, Pour Mohammadi conferred with his Iraqi counterpart Hassan al-Shammari on bilateral ties in Baghdad.

Pour Mohammadi pointed to the current Iran-Iraq judicial relations, and said, "The two countries should expand judicial cooperation, organize cross-border travel, tackle illegal entries and determine the fate of detainees."

Al-Shammari, for his part, hailed Iran's determination to support the Iraqi stability and security as well as the democratic process.

During the meeting, the Iranian and Iraqi justice ministers signed a memorandum of understating (MoU) on extradition of prisoners.

According to the agreement, the Iranian and Iraqi justice ministries will set up a joint committee at the earliest to examine the situation of the prisoners and prepare the ground for their extradition.

The prisoners will serve their prison terms in their own countries.
