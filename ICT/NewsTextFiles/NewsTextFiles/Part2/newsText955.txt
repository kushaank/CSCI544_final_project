
NORTH Korea has made a rare public apology after the collapse of an apartment building which is believed to have killed hundreds of people.

Officials have apologised to the bereaved families after the rescue operation was concluded on Saturday.

The 23-storey building, thought to have housed 92 families, collapsed in Pyongyang on Tuesday.

State media described the tragedy as a "serious accident", and blamed the minister of people's security Choe Pu Il for the deaths, saying that he "can never be pardoned".

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un "sat up all night, feeling painful after being told about the accident", according to reports.

The public admission of fault by the government is unusual in the secretive country, where the state-run media avoid covering negative events.

Residents close to where the building collapsed claimed that the building collapsed because building regulations were breached.

One said: "This accident happened because they broke the rules and methods of construction.

The collapse comes after North Korean media heavily criticised the South Korean government for its handling of last month's ferry sinking that left more than 300 people dead or missing.
