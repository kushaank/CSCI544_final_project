
GEORGIA >> A 16-year-old female that went missing from her Wilton home last week has been recovered in Georgia, in the company of a local man who last month pleaded guilty to rape.

Saratoga County Sheriff’s Lt. Jeffrey Brown said the teenager disappeared late at night May 15, but stressed she was not kidnapped.

She was located in the early-morning hours May 18 in Georgia and taken into custody by the Division of Family and Children Services, which, Brown said, would arrange for her to be returned to her parents.

The teenager was found with Aaron Current, 22, of Saratoga Springs. Current was arrested on a felony bench warrant for third-degree rape, out of the Saratoga County Sheriff’s Office. In New York, third-degree rape is a felony charge for engaging in sexual intercourse with a person younger than 17, too young to give legal consent.

According to the Saratoga County District Attorney’s Office, Current pleaded guilty to third-degree rape April 22 for an incident that occurred on Nov. 17, 2013 and for which he was charged on Dec. 9. He was scheduled to be sentenced June 17.
