
U.S. District Judge Michael McShane threw out the voter-approved ban Monday, saying it is unconstitutional.

Many gay couples across the state waited for hours for the ruling to be issued and immediately began getting marriage licenses after it was issued.

Four gay and lesbian couples filed a suit, arguing that Oregon's marriage laws exclude them from a fundamental right.

Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum refused to defend the ban, saying no legal arguments could support it in light of last year's decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Rosenblum has argued in the past that denying homosexuals the right to marry is unconstitutional.

Meanwhile, the federal judge turned down a request by the National Organization for Marriage to defend the law on behalf of its Oregon members.
