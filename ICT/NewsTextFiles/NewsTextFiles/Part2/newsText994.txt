
Whitaker's lawyer enters a not guilty plea.

Mohammed Whitaker, the 27-year-old Grandview resident arrested last month for allegedly shooting randomly at cars on metro highways, appeared in Jackson County court today for an arraignment. There, his lawyer, Joshuah Peter, entered for Whitaker a not guilty plea on all 20 of his felony counts for shooting at a motor vehicle and armed criminal action.

Three people were injured in the attacks for which Whitaker stands accused. Jackson County Prosecutor's office spokesman Mike Mansur told NBC News that Whitaker could face life in prison if convicted. He is being held on $1 million bond.

Whitaker's next court appearance is scheduled for June 6.
