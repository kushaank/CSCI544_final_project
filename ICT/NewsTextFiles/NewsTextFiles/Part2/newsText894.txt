
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - South Korea's president says she will push to disband the coast guard in the wake of last month's ferry disaster.

The coast guard has been under growing public criticism over its alleged poor search and rescue work after the ferry Sewol sank on April 16, leaving more than 300 people dead or missing.

President Park Geun-hye said Monday in a speech that the coast guard's rescue operations after the ferry disaster were a failure.

She says the coast guard's responsibilities would be handed over to police and a new government body she plans to establish.
