
The Prime Minister says he has no intention of discussing drone strikes with US President Barack Obama during his upcoming visit to the White House.

John Key confirmed next month's trip this morning, saying it was a welcome invitation and a good chance to formally discuss pertinent issues including the Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade agreement.

However, Mr Key says that there's no reason to bring up the issue of drone strikes with the President. That's despite recent claims that New Zealand's spy agency has provided information to the US that they have then allegedly used for attacks.

"In the end we're talking about taking action against people who have proven to be incredibly dangerous individuals who want to put at risk the lives of others," says Mr Key about the United States' controversial use of drone strikes.

"I think under the circumstances under which I can see that they've been used, for the most part I think I'm comfortable with it."

Mr Key says while the GCSB may gather certain information that it provides to its partners, what they use it for is up to them.

However, Labour Leader David Cunliffe says it's an issue and he would take the matter further.

"I would be seeking some assurances that activities that pertain to New Zealand's supplied intelligence were compatible with both the rule of New Zealand law and international law."
