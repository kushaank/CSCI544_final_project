PORTLAND, Maine -- A Maine enforcement action made public today indicates that the National Organization for Marriage (NOM) may have intentionally violated a variety of state laws in 2009, including not only Maine but also Iowa and New Hampshire campaign finance laws.

The revelation is contained in a scathing investigative report (shared below) by the Maine Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices, which finds that NOM committed a “significant violation of law” in 2009 and that recommends civil penalties and donor disclosure. The Maine report also notes a pattern of deceit in which NOM failed to be truthful with investigators.

The revelation of NOM’s apparent solicitation of significant funds for Iowa elections is stunning in light of events that occurred at approximately the same time in 2009 when Iowa regulators warned NOM against such activities and NOM denied engaging in them.

In fact, it now appears that just over a month before NOM’s letter, NOM solicited its largest donor to designate $300,000 to support its Iowa electoral activities in violation of Iowa law and contrary to NOM’s lawyer’s assertion.

NOM was subject to an investigation last year by the Iowa Ethics Board, prompted by Fred Karger, for a similar failure to disclose donors who supported its efforts related to the retention election of Iowa Supreme Court justices.

Questions also exist whether NOM was similarly required to register a PAC and disclose its donors in New Hampshire. HRC intends to notify authorities in both states of the revelations in the Maine investigation.
