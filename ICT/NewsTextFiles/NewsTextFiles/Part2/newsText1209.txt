
China began evacuating nationals from Vietnam on ships on Monday even as a Vietnamese official said nearly all foreign-owned factories damaged in last week’s anti-Chinese riots near Ho Chi Minh City were back to normal operations.

Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua said Monday that the first of four ships had left the port in Ha Tinh province on Monday with 989 evacuees.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said in Beijing on Monday that security in Vietnam has deteriorated, and warned the Association of Southeast Asian Nations against taking sides in a dispute over an oil rig that China put in waters that it and Vietnam claim.

Mr. Hong repeated notices issued Sunday that China was advising against travel to Vietnam and was suspending unspecified diplomatic exchanges.

While the row started over the oil rig, protests turned deadly last week, when riots broke out in industrial parks in the south and central parts of Vietnam, leading to arson and looting of not only Chinese factories, but Taiwanese, South Korean and other foreign-owned factories as well. Two Chinese nationals were killed and more than 140 others were injured.

Tran Van Nam, deputy chairman of Binh Duong province near Ho Chi Minh City, said Monday he has reassured foreign businesses that order has been restored, adding that more than 90% of foreign-owned businesses damaged last week had resumed operations.

Bill Clinton pushed for China into the WTO, thinking that they will somehow magically change to a democratic society once they have enough money….wrong! With tons (literally) of USD in their banks, they have been arming themselves to the teeth and waiting for the right time to take over the world (starting with smaller/weaker countries. China should be stopped before their arrogant ways get a lot of people killed. China plans for short terms, the USA plans for generations ahead. I hope corporations would bring the jobs out of China and bring them back to North America.

they have done the right thing, they must drive those chinese out before it brings down the economy in Vietnam. they are invaders.
