
Posco (005490) is targeting a 67 percent increase in profit in 2016 as South Koreaâ€™s biggest steel producer focuses on its core business.

The Pohang-based company aims to reach a group operating profit of 5 trillion won ($4.9 billion) in 2016 from 3 trillion won last year, it said today in a regulatory filing. Sales will probably gain 26 percent to 77.8 trillion won.

Posco, whose first-quarter profit plunged 75 percent, will consider selling non-core businesses and seek to sell stakes or offer first-time shares in its affiliate company, according to the statement. The company is weighing various measures, although no details on the proposed changes have been decided, it said last month.

On a parent basis, the company expects 3 trillion won of operating profit on 32.5 trillion won of sales in 2016, it said.

The shares fell 0.5 percent to 310,000 won at the close of trading in Seoul . The stock has dropped 5.4 percent this year, compared with a 0.2 percent gain in the Kospi index.
