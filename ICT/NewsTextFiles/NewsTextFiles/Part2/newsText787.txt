
Arguments are scheduled for next month in a lawsuit over how public schools are funded in Alaska.

The Ketchikan Gateway Borough sued in January, arguing a required local contribution for schools is unconstitutional and that municipalities are "coerced" to pay it under threat of otherwise receiving no state aid for local districts.

The state, in court filings, says the borough has based its claim on a misreading of the state constitution. The state contends the required local contribution provision isn't new, and likens it to other programs that require local matches.

Both sides are asking a judge to rule in their favor. The Fairbanks North Star Borough has filed a friend of the court brief, in support of Ketchikan Gateway Borough.

Arguments are scheduled for June 2 in Ketchikan.
