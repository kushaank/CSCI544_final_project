
Park Geun-hye, President of South Korea apologized formally on Monday for the ferry disaster last month which killed 300 passengers, mostly school children. She also added that she would dismantle the coast guard as they had failed in their rescue mission.

Park was hit hard by the national outcry over the slow response to the worst civilian maritime disaster in 20 years.

The ferry Sewol capsized and sank with 476 passengers and crew on board and at least 286 people were killed and 18 remain missing. Only 172 people were rescued, with the rest presumed to have drowned.

Besides holding the ferry owners, the captain and crew responsible, Park singled out problems within the coast guard as the main reason for the high casualty toll from the accident. “Had there been an immediate and proactive rescue operation after the accident, we would have been able to reduce the casualties,” Park said.

The 15 surviving crew members were indicted last week, including the captain and three senior crew members on homicide charges, the rest of the 11 were indicted for negligence.
