
The thought of losing his educational assistant has devastated 13-year-old Harry Barberian who has cerebral palsy.

Barberian is in the intensive support program at Parklawn Junior Middle School where four of the school’s five educational assistants are being relocated next month.

“They’re the child’s second parent because they’re performing tasks that are reformed normally by a parent – toileting, dressing and undressing,” explained Barberian’s mother Linda Rodeck.

The Toronto District School Board says their special education funding from the province was reduced by $7 million this year and that these shifts of positions have been happening across the board for the last two years.

He adds that none of the jobs have been cut.

“Regardless of the job classification we still have qualified caring EA’s in the classroom helping students with special needs in this case,” said Bird.

Parents say say that their children have spent years building relationships with the current educational assistants and that can’t easily be replaced.

To help ease the transition for these kids the TDSB says one educational assistant will be staying on at the school until at least the end of the next school year.
