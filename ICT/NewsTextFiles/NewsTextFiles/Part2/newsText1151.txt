
Victoria Azarenka has pulled out of next week's French Open having failed to recover from a troublesome foot injury.

The world no. 5 has not featured since her first round loss to Lauren Davis at Indian Wells and has missed tournaments in Doha, Miami, Madrid and Rome in the build up to Roland Garros.

The two time Australian Open champion initially suffered the injury to her left foot in her quarter final loss to Agnieszka Radwanska in Melbourne and confirmed through her Twitter page that the problem will see her miss the second major of the year.

"Unfortunately I will not be able to compete in Roland Garros this year," the 24-year-old wrote. "Working hard on my recovery and getting back on court."

Hi Guys - Unfortunately I will not be able to compete in Roland Garros this year. Working hard on my recovery & getting back on the court.

Azarenka reached the semi-finals of the 2013 French Open where she was eliminated by eventual runner up Maria Sharapova.

This year's tournament begins on Sunday until 8 June.
