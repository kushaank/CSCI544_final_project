Nebraska's economic development director and state labor commissioner has resigned to take a private sector job.

Catherine Lang will leave state government next month after more than three decades of service. Gov. Dave Heineman announced her resignation on Monday.

The 57-year-old Lang has worked in state government since 1981. She was appointed Commissioner of Labor in August 2008, after serving as deputy tax commissioner. She was named director of the Department of Economic Development in 2011, and has worked in both roles since that time.

Both agencies have worked on efforts to find jobs for veterans. During Lang's tenure, the Department of Economic Development opened a trade office in China.

Lang earned her bachelor's and law degrees from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Her last day will be June 27.
