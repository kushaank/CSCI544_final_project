
Last week an albino woman in a rural area of the East African country of Tanzania was murdered for her body parts. Two witch doctors have been arrested in connection with the death, though itâ€™s not clear whether the pair committed the crime themselves or hired others to mutilate the woman.

In Africa, witch doctors are consulted not only for healing diseases, but also for placing (or removing) magic curses or bringing luck in love or business. The belief and practice of using body parts for magical ritual or benefit is called muti. Muti murders are particularly brutal, with knives and machetes used to cut and hack off limbs, breasts, and other body parts from their living victims.

Though the two witch doctors accused of Lugataâ€™s death have been arrested, many Africans believe that police, politicians and judges are hesitant to pursue muti murders because belief in witchcraft is so widespread. Itâ€™s possible that some of the judges believe they gained their positions in part because of magic.

Last year the second-largest hospital in the Southern African country of Swaziland was accused of operating a black market in human body parts used in magic spells . The situation for albinos in East Africa has improved in recent years, and most traditional healers there do not engage in muti. Still, the belief that body parts can aid in magic rituals has been a part of African culture for centuries, and such superstitions remain a very real threat.
