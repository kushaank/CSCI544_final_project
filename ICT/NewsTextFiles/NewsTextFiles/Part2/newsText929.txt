
Chinese budget carrier Spring Airlines on Saturday announced its plan to suspend all charter flights from Shanghai to Vietnam from May 19.

Spring Airlines' flight 9C8909 had been originally planned to arrive in Vietnam on Friday. However, all 150 tourists who were supposed to board the flight cancelled their trip.

The flight departed for Vietnam anyway, and picked up 160 passengers back to Shanghai on Saturday.

The carrier said it would suspend nine flights carrying 350 passengers to Vietnam in the next month.

China Eastern Airlines also said passengers who had planned to travel to Vietnam could change their departure time or ask for refunds for tickets to Vietnam until June 30.

According to the Chinese foreign ministry, more than 3,000 Chinese nationals have been evacuated from Vietnam as of Saturday afternoon after the recent deadly anti-China riots. Two Chinese nationals were killed and more than 100 others injured in the violence as protests over a South China Sea dispute spread across Vietnam.
