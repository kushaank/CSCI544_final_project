
Australian authorities are processing five foreign fishermen at the immigration detention centre on Christmas Island.

The men were brought ashore on Friday after being caught illegally fishing on Thursday in Australian waters, about 175 nautical miles (324km) east-south-east of Christmas Island.

Border Protection Command (BPC) personnel say they found 50 kilograms of Spanish mackerel, 20 kilograms each of tuna and dolphinfish and 10 kilograms of barracuda on the boat.

The crew was also allegedly seen working with nets and lines.

BPC commander Rear Admiral Michael Noonan says illegal fishing is a serious issue and Australian laws will be enforced in its maritime zones.

"Illegal foreign fishing undermines Australia's diverse marine life, and Australian Government agencies will continually work to deter illegal foreign fishermen from entering Australian waters," he said.

Australian Fisheries Management Authority general manager of operations Peter Venslovas says the latest incident follows others in the past three weeks.

In Darwin last week, 10 Indonesians from a boat caught in April were fined a total of $90,000, and the master of a Vietnamese boat, also caught in April, was fined $8,000 for illegal fishing in Australian waters.
