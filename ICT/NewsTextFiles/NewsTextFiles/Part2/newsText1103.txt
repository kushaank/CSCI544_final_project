
CORN ANALYSIS - Corn closed the week $.23 3/4 lower. Last week, private exporters announced a sale of 126,000 mts of corn to South Korea.Weekly export sales of corn showed a total of 15.4 mb. To reach the current USDA forecast, corn only needs to average 3.6 mb needed each week. The weekly crop progress report showed the corn crop is 59% planted as of May 11th vs. the 5 year avg. of 58% and 18% emerged vs. the 5 year avg. of 25%. As we have been expecting, the planting pace has moved close to normal while emergence remains behind normal due to the cold weather. Informa’s May acreage review showed corn acres down 110,000 at 91.6 million acres. With 4 million less corn acres this year, the market will be more sensitive this year to weather issues should they arise. Commercials will be using this break in prices to build long positions in an attempt to benefit from a weather event. Producers can look at out of the money call options for insurance as a cheap way to benefit from a weather related rally if it occurs. Buying out of the money calls on price weakness during the month of May can pay dividends on a weather inspired rally during June and or July.STRATEGY & OUTLOOKProducers are 100% sold of 2013/14 crop. Producers are 25% sold of the 2014/15 crop and own 480 puts on 50% of the crop. Buy out of the money December calls on 25% of sales if December corn hits $4.66.SOYBEANS ANALYSISSoybeans closed the week $.20 3/4 lower from last week. Last week, private exporters announced a sale of 180,000 mts of soybeans sold to an unknown destination; 116,000 mts of soybean meal to Thailand and 40,000 mts of bean oil to China.Weekly export sales of soybeans showed 2.7 mb for old crop and land 11.9 mb for new crop sales. The In the weekly crop progress report, USDA said The USDA showed soybeans at 20% planted vs. the 5 year avg. of 21%. The April NOPA crush was above the average estimate of 130.156 at 132.668 million bushels and oil stocks were built to 2.058 billion pounds above the average guess of 1.998. Informa’s May acreage review showed soybean acres up 580,000 to 82.1 million. Front month prices have stalled below key resistance and pulled back, trying to find a price level that will stimulate demand. Meanwhile, new crop prices have held steady as the market has not seen enough planting progress to remove planting premium from prices. The market is anticipating nearly double the ending stocks this growing season compared to last year, but that is assuming nearly perfect growing conditions. Soybean producers intend to seed more acres this year than the previous year, but the old trading adage of its not what you plant, its what you grow applies this year to soybeans.STRATEGY & OUTLOOKProducers are 100% sold of the 2013/14 crop. Producers are 25% sold of 2014/15 production.WHEAT ANALYSISFor the week, Chicago wheat closed $.48 3/4 lower; Kansas City wheat $.61 lower and Minneapolis wheat $.56 lower. Last week, exporters did not report any private sales.Weekly export sales for wheat showed a total of 9.2 mb for both old and new crop sales. The USDA reported Winter wheat conditions deteriorated to 42% poor and very poor vs last week’s 38% and last year’s 39%. Good to excellent dropped to 30% vs last year’s 31%. Spring wheat Planting progress was reported at 34%, up from 26% but still behind the 5 year average of 53%. Minnesota and North Dakota are lagging the most at 8% and 11% respectively. Spring wheat is taking over the leadership role of wheat in an attempt to buy acres and increase wheat stocks since the winter wheat production will be down this year. Informa’s May acreage review showed spring wheat acres up 50,000 at 12.1 million which seems unlikely given the slow seeding pace of spring wheat in the Dakotas and Minnesota. Wheat prices are breaking lower as the market is preparing for the winter wheat harvest and has already dialed in the poor crop. The market typically liquidates ahead of harvest and sees how good or bad the yields actually are.STRATEGY & OUTLOOKKC producers are now sold 65% of new crop production and own July 830 puts on remaining 35% of production. Sold 20% of 2015 production. MW wheat producers are now 65% sold of new crop production and own September 800 puts on remaining 35% of production.

Export demand for US beef and pork products was particularly strong in March, as evidenced by the strong gains in shipments even as prices escalated to all time record highs. In part the gains may reflect efforts on the part of foreign buyers to stock up ahead of expected supply shortfalls during the summer months. This may have been especially the case in the pork complex as total exports of fresh/frozen and processed pork jumped some 23% compared to the previous year. The bulk of the gains came from a sharp increase in exports to Mexico and China/Hong Kong. For the month, US pork shipments to Mexico were pegged at 40,075 mts; 11,966 mt higher than the previous year, an increase of 43%.STRATEGY & OUTLOOKSold 100% of June; 50% of production for July; 50% for August; 50% of October production and 50% of December production.
