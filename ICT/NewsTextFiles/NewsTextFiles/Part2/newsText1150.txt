Millionaire politician Clive Palmer has switched his position on the Abbott government's plans to deregulate university fees, saying he will block the legislation just days after flagging he would support the controversial changes.

With Labor and the Greens opposed to the government's higher education agenda, the fate of any legislation will rest on the votes of Mr Palmer and his cross-bench senators.

Mr Palmer, who went to the election with a policy of abolishing university fees, stunned the university sector last week by indicating he may support the government's policy.

This echoed the rhetoric of Education Minister Christopher Pyne, who has said Australian universities need to be “set free” to compete with the best in the world.

Mr Palmer was still open to the policy two days later when asked by Fairfax Media .

"We've got to see how we can have a win-win situation for Australia and for Australian students," he said.

"I do think our universities could be a great export for Australia."

Now Mr Palmer has now shifted his position and says he will not support any policy that leads to increased university fees.

“Universities should be able to charge whatever they want to international students but there should be no HECS for Australian students,” he said on Monday.
