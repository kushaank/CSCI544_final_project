
SEOUL, May 19 (Yonhap) -- North Korea denounced South Korean President Park Geun-hye's apology over last month's deadly ferry disaster on Monday, calling the accident "a deliberate act of murder and a massacre."

   The North's criticism came hours after Park offered a fresh apology over the tragedy and vowed to overhaul the nation's safety systems, including by dismantling the Coast Guard and creating a new safety agency.

"The address derides public sentiment. The disaster was not simply caused by the Park group's irresponsibility and incompetence but an unprecedented deliberate murder and a massacre perpetrated by it," the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea said in an English-language report.
