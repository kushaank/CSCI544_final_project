Australian jockey Tommy Berry celebrated an emotional win in Singapore's biggest race aboard the John Moore-trained Dan Excel.

Berry steered the gelding to a comprehensive victory in Sunday's $3 million Singapore Airlines International Cup then dedicated the win to his late twin brother and fellow jockey, Nathan.

"This win here in Singapore is very important as this is where Nathan last rode and he really enjoyed himself here," Berry said.

"There was a big butterfly that I saw in the mounting yard and he followed me on the way to the gates.

"Nathan was with me tonight.

"This horse is not so young any more but he always toughs it out and after his last run when he was caught four wide and still ran second to Variety Club in the Champions Mile, I told John he should go to Singapore, and he told me he was and I was riding him.

"I just let him cruise to the lead at the top of the straight.

"It's a win I won't forget."

Nathan Berry had just begun a riding contract in Singapore when he was struck down by a rare illness.

He was returned home to Sydney where he died last month.

Dan Excel was the lesser fancied of Moore's two runners, with last year's winner Military Attack the popular elect.

But Dan Excel had the best run from the inside gate while Military Attack, ridden Joao Moreira, had to be used up early to get across from his wide draw.

"I'm really happy for Tommy as we all know he went through really difficult times in the last month or so with the passing of his brother Nathan," Moore said.

Berry was grateful to Moore and thanked the Singapore Turf Club for its support for his brother.
