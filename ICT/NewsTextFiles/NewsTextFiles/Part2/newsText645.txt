
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and his Venezuelan counterpart, Nicholas Maduro, have struck a deal which will see 240,000 barrels of oil and diesel sent to the Palestinian Authority by state-owned company PetrÃ³leos de Venezuela.

During his three-day visit to the oil rich South American nation,   which sits on the worldâ€™s largest oil reserves, Abbas thanked   Maduro for his support.

â€œThank you Venezuela for helping to break the monopoly that   Israel has over our economy. Thank you Venezuela for responding   to our needs. Thank you Venezuela for being available to continue   to lend the Palestinian people more support in their fight,â€� said Abbas.

Maduro reiterated his support for Palestine and its desire to be   a fully independent state.

â€œWe welcome the Palestinian people and the Arabs. Our people   support your right to a land of prosperity. Today, Petro   Palestine has been born,â€� Maduro said.

Maduro also agreed to support the Palestinian Authority's request   to be granted observer status in three Latin American   organizations: the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), the   Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA), and   the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC).

The leaders also announced a number of bilateral projects between   the two nations, including the possibility of Palestinian medical   students studying at Venezuelan universities.

While in Caracas, Abbas also visited the grave of Hugo Chavez,   Maduroâ€™s predecessor who died of cancer last year.

The deal comes as Tel Aviv barred Palestinian banks from making   shekel deposits in Israel and limited electricity supply to the   Palestinian Authority to half strength for an hour a day. The   Israelis are also withholding US$116 million of Palestinian tax   revenue.

The punitive measures were in response to the reconciliation   agreement between the Palestinian Fatah party, which rules the   Palestinian Authority, and Hamas, the militant group which   controls Gaza, according to Haaretz. The Israeli Electric Company   pointed to a debt of $154 million which is owed by the   Palestinian Jerusalem District Electricity Company as the reason   behind the punitive measure.

Abbas arrived in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, on Thursday   after a meeting with US Secretary of State John Kerry the day   before â€“ the first since peace talks between the Palestinians and   Israelis collapsed in April.

Although US-brokered peace negotiations broke down last month,   reports emerged Saturday that Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi   Livni, Israelâ€™s main negotiator during the nine months of talks,   met secretly in London last week with President Abbas.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, known for his hardline   views on Palestinian relations, distanced himself from the   meeting on Saturday, saying that Livni was "representing only   herself and not the Israeli government."

Aw that's amazing news. Well done Venezuela! Viva Palestine, viva Venezuela! Palestine are in need for crucial global support against those Zionists.
