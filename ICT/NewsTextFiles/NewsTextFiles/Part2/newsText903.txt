
South Korea's president has vowed to break up the country's coastguard because of its failure to rescue hundreds of schoolchildren in last month's ferry disaster .

President Park Geun-hye formally apologised for the tragedy, in which around 300 people died after the Sewol vessel sank with 476 passengers on board.

286 people were killed - most of them schoolchildren - and 18 are still missing.

Fighting back tears during a national television address, Geun-hye said: "I apologise to the nation for the pain and suffering that everyone felt, as the president who should have been responsible for the safety and lives of the people."

She vowed that sweeping reforms would improve oversight, as well as tough punishment for bureaucrats and businesses whose negligence endangers public safety.

She added: "A 20-year-old vessel was bought and refurbished to add excessive capacity, then it was loaded with much more cargo than allowed with a false reporting on weight, but not a single person in the position to supervise stopped any of it."

Geun-hye said structural problems within the coastguard were the main reason why the death toll was so high.

"Had there been an immediate and proactive rescue operation after the accident, we would have been able to reduce the casualties," she said.

The coastguard's rescue duties will be transferred to a new national emergency safety agency, and the national police will take over its investigative function.

The other 11 crew members face charges of negligence.
