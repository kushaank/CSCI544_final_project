
According to court documents, Crockett is accused of assaulting the victim with a belt sander.

Day and Hoar were arrested last week. Crockett turned himself in over the weekend.

"I know he's innocent. I know he was with me the entire night," said Jamie Williams.

Williams lives with Crockett and his parents.

The two have a daughter together.

"He's had hard times in the past but he's turned his life around, and for the past two and a half months he's been doing amazing," said Williams.

Williams is one of two people who swore affidavits to back up Crockett's alibi that on April 11 he was at a meeting in Portland and then played pool on Congress Street.

Fairfield said she has pictures of time-stamped text messages from Crockett that support his story.

She said she told police but said they have not followed up on it.

Buxton Police Chief Michael Grovo said his department's investigation is far from over.

"We need to follow up his alibis, which we haven't had the opportunity to do yet and you have my word we're going to do that. We want to make sure we have all of the possible evidence that's out there to present," said Grovo.

Investigators say Crockett asked for chocolate milk, Mountain Dew, and pizza during negotiations to give himself up.

They said it appeared that he had been living in the woods for several days at the time of his surrender.
