
On the eve of an emergency University of Saskatchewan Board of Govenors meeting,  a University of Saskatchewan professor hopes the board will remove the university president and provost for their "outrageous" handling of the TransformUS.

In a letter to board chair Susan Milburn, Jim Miller, a history professor and Canada Research Chair, asked the board to "dismiss" president Ilene Busch-Vishniac and provost Brett Fairbairn for their handling of TransformUS and the firing of a professor who publicly spoke against the cost cutting process.

On Friday, Busch-Vishniac said the university "blundered" when it removed his tenure and has since offered it back to Buckingham.

"The events that have been revealed recently and the behaviour of the president and the provost that have been revealed by Dr. Buckingham and their subsequent actions, illustrated that the supposed support for transformUS that they claim exists was really achieved by coercion and intimidation."

He says these actions have "seriously undermined" the credibility of the TransformUS process and the university's reputation.

"It's outrageous and in the history of the University of Saskatchewan, it's quite unprecedented," he said, adding the president and provost should be removed with cause to deny them severance pay.

Miller said the board must suspend implementation of TransformUS action plan, appoint acting president and "search for more collegial and cooperative academic leader."

The 11 board members will gather Monday night for a closed emergency meeting, however, Minister of Advanced Education Rob Norris will be in attendance.

Board members have either been unavailable, did not respond to messages and emails or declined to comment.

"I know what should happen but whether they will have the good sense and fortitude to do it is a whole other question," Miller said.
