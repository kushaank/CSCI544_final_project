A nine-member search committee with heavy local representation has narrowed the field to five candidates for the next Des Moines Area Community College Carroll Campus provost, a position held until late last year by veteran Carroll educator Steve Schulz.

Kim Linduska, executive vice president for academic affairs for the Ankeny-based DMACC system, said 43 candidates applied for the Carroll position. DMACC officials narrowed that pool, based on education and experience scoring, down to 15. The committee interviewed seven candidates via phone and the online tool Skype.

The search committee, as well as Carroll DMACC staff, students and members of the community, began meeting with the final five candidates Tuesday in Carroll and will continue the process through next week.

"I was really, really pleased with the quality of the candidates, the experiences," Linduska said.

The committee expects to make a hiring recommendation by the end of next week to Linduska and DMACC President Rob Denson, who together will make the final call. Linduska said an announcement is expected by the first week of March.

The advertised salary range for the position is $105,000 to $131,250.

Denson appointed former Carroll faculty member John Brocklesby to serve as interim provost, a position he has held since Dec. 1. Schulz left DMACC and Carroll to become president of North Iowa Area Community College in Mason City.
