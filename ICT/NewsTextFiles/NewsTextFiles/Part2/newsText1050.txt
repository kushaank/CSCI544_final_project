
The burn ban is officially lifted as the Victoria County Commissioners Court voted Monday to ratify an order ending the ban on burning.

However, it may not last long because the only rain forecasted in Victoria is a trace amount that could possibly fall Sunday, according to information from the National Weather Service.

According to the Keetch-Byram Drought Index, which measures drought from 0 to 800, Victoria's average fell to 411 on Monday.

Christina Barron, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said despite the nearly 2 inches of rain last week, Victoria is still 7 inches behind normal levels for the year.

"Our wet season is toward August and September," Barron said. "With hopes of going into an El Nino year, we're looking at better chances of rain later in the year, maybe not anytime soon, but we're hopeful."

So far this year, Victoria has received a little more than 6 inches of rain.

Victoria County Judge Don Pozzi lifted the burn ban May 13.

Barron said an upper-level system is moving across the Rocky Mountains and will "dig down into South Texas."

As that moves east through the weekend, Victoria could have a chance of rain to occur.
