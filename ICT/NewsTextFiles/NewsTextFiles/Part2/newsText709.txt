
Yayoi will open its doors on Sydney's blue chip Bridge Street early next month but the significance of its opening stretches beyond just this 82-seat Japanese restaurant.

Yayoi is owned by Japanese food giant Plenus, the latest player in Tokyo’s food invasion of Australia. David Coates spent 12 years in Japan and, while there, worked for the Australian Trade Commission.

He became aware of Japanese food giants eyeing Australia as its domestic market became increasingly "mature".

Coates was involved in the opening of Ippudo in the city, before crossing to work for Plenus Australia.

"We really want to offer the traditional Japanese set meal you'd get in Tokyo. It will be authentic, we haven't changed the recipes at all," he says.

"We thought Yayoi was enough of a mouthful," Coates explains.

They’ll open a second restaurant in Sydney, followed by Melbourne and Adelaide.

Plenus may also bring its Hotto Motto restaurant to Sydney.

As well, from next year Sydney will have a new Tokyotown district at the redeveloped Carlton & United brewery site in Chippendale.
