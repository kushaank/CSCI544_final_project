
NantHealth raised $135 million from three investors, according to an SEC filing . The amount almost certainly includes the $100 million NantHealth raised last month from the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA), that country’s sovereign investment fund, as well as the investment Blackberry contributed in April 2014. The SEC filing notes that there were three investors in the round. This latest round brings NantHealth’s total announced funding to about $166 million.

NantHealth offers a cloud-based, clinical decision support platform used by at least 250 hospitals, according to the company. Nant offers a range of services, including a population health platform and a suite of products built to provide a learning system for the treatment of cancer.

The investment from KIA will be used to “accelerate innovation” NantHealth noted in a release.

BlackBerry and NantHealth also didn’t release specific details about their collaboration, but the companies noted in April that they saw opportunities to leverage BlackBerry’s QNX operating system for connect medical devices; to offer BBM Protected to healthcare providers as a secure messaging service; and to integrate NantHealth’s clinical operating system platform with BlackBerry’s offerings.
