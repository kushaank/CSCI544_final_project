
Former President Bill Clinton will receive the Dean's Award for Public Leadership next month from the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota.

At the event, held at 5:30 p.m. June 9 at Northrop Auditorium on the Minneapolis campus, Clinton will offer reflections on civil rights as part of the Humphrey School's series of events marking the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

The Public Leadership awards are designed to honor people who have contributed to the public good through leadership and service, the school said. Additional Public Leadership awards will be given out in late June at a separate event.

Tickets are available at 612-624-2345 or northrop.umn.edu . They are $50 each, $30 of which is considered a tax-deductible contribution. Organizers say the proceeds will support public affairs student scholarships designed to promote diversity in the spirit of the Civil Rights Act.
