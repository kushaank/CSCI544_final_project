
The ruling leaves Duke Energy for now responsible for taking "immediate steps" to stop leaks from its coal ash ponds, like those above at the Riverbend Steam Station. But action likely remains months away.

But it is unlikely the ruling will lead to any immediate action by Duke (NYSE: DUK) to stop the leaks. The N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources , which regulates ash ponds, disagrees with the judgeâ€™s interpretation of the law. And the state has joined Duke in appealing the Wake court's ruling.

Duke issued a brief statement in response.

D.J. Gerken , who represented a coalition of environmental groups in the case, welcomes the order.

He acknowledges neither Duke nor the state have any incentive to take immediate action. But he says the center and its clients are willing to go to court in several existing cases to force the issue.
