
The Chicago Cubs made an error recently that was more embarrassing than a wild throw or a bobbled groundball.

A 1927 photograph of the late aviator Charles Lindbergh was included on a mural at Wrigley Field, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Cubs’ home field. But the team said last week that the picture was actually taken when Lindbergh visited Comiskey Park, the former home of the Chicago White Sox.

Team spokesman Julian Green said the picture of Lindbergh was mislabeled as photographs were gathered to mark the anniversary season.

A closer look at the mural also revealed that a photograph of President Franklin D. Roosevelt was taken at Wrigley before he was actually elected, despite what the caption reads.

“We are now reviewing all of the photos,” Green said.

Green said the team is planning to fix the mural. And although the photograph replacing the one of Lindbergh hasn’t been selected yet, he said the Cubs will make sure it was taken at Wrigley.
