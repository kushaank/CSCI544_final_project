
French believes that Britain is experiencing 'racism by stealth'

Dawn French has spoken out about the racist abuse she suffered during her marriage to Lenny Henry, revealing that her house was nearly burnt down in an arson attack as the couple slept.

Dawn, who has a mixed-race daughter Billie, 23, with Lenny, 55, is concerned that racist attitudes have not changed in 30 years.

And she believes that her daughter and ex-husband – who recently found himself at the centre of a race row after a UKIP candidate said he should leave Britain to live in a black country – are experiencing racism by stealth.

The pair, who split in 2010 after 25 years of marriage, have previously spoken of other shocking abuse they suffered as a mixed-race couple.

They were once targeted by members of the Ku Klux Klan who smeared excrement on their front door and doorstep and daubed graffiti on their walls.

Miss French made her comments on Friday evening’s BBC Radio 4 Front Row show while promoting her first solo touring show about her life, Thirty Million Minutes.

She said she would not be discussing her new husband, charity boss Mark Bignell, 51, in her stage show.

Asked how they met she added: ‘He had known my mother for years and was a colleague of hers, helping people with drug and alcohol problems.

Ukip candidate William Henwood was forced to resign from the party last month after he suggested Lenny, should emigrate to a ‘black country’ .

His remark came after the star launched a campaign for more people from ethnic minorities on British TV and media.
