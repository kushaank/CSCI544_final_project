
A potential “battle is brewing” between the energy and insurance industries because of differences when it comes to climate change and the consequences it will have on each sector.

An article in Forbes explains that in the US, whilst insurance firms are staking claims in the climate cause, many of their congressional backers have remained sceptical of the science behind climate change. This is causing a rift to develop between the two industries.

Writer Ken Silverstein states, “For insurers, it’s not about political machinations but rather, it’s about the potential economic losses.

Last week ratings agency Standard & Poor’s warned that climate change was a “megatrend” that will impact on sovereign creditworthiness . In a report the firm explained that the effects of climate change would be felt through various channels, including economic growth and public finances.

Extreme weather was highlighted as one of the main factors affecting sovereign ratings, with weather-related losses rising across all continents since the 1980s. During this period, costs have increased fourfold in Asia and North America.

Despite the poor figure, Silverstein notes that not all carriers are passive, pointing to US firm Farmers Insurance Co, a unit of Zurich insurance, which is suing Chicago for failing to prevent flooding related to climate change.
