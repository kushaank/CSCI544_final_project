
Portugal is working on the possibilities of selling bonds via banks and through auctions as it aims to raise financing to cover “around two-thirds” of its 2015 funding needs by the end of this year, Secretary of State for Treasury Isabel Castelo Branco said.

Portugal on May 17 followed Ireland in exiting its three-year bailout program without the safety net of a precautionary credit line . The government announced the decision about the bailout exit on May 4 after the country last month held its first bond auction since requesting the 78 billion-euro ($107 billion) rescue from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund in 2011.

Portugal built up a cash buffer before the end of the aid program. Debt agency IGCP said in an April 2 presentation that it ended 2013 with what it calls a treasury cash position of 15.3 billion euros. It has raised 6.25 billion euros selling bonds through banks this year.

“The cash buffer is something that we are always working on, it does not have a pre-defined size,” Castelo Branco said. The country has one year of funding needs covered by the cash buffer, she said. The decision on the amount of financing raised for 2015 will take into account market opportunities and the exact funding needs, according to Castelo Branco.

Portugal’s borrowing costs have dropped since the beginning of 2012, helped by signs of economic recovery and a market rally spurred by the European Central Bank ’s pledge to do what it takes to defend the euro. The 10-year (GSPT10YR) bond yield dropped to as low as 3.44 percent on May 9, the least since 2006, after reaching more than 18 percent in January 2012.

The yield climbed to 3.86 percent today. Portugal, which pays interest of about 3 percent on its bailout loans, is rated below investment grade by Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings.

While Portugal emerged from its longest recession in at least 25 years in the second quarter of 2013, Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho still has to cut spending to meet budget deficit goals. The government targets the deficit will narrow to 4 percent of gross domestic product in 2014 from 4.9 percent in 2013, when debt reached 129 percent of GDP.
