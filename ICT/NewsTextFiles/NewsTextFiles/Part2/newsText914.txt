
Five receipts from five different businesses in Rolla could earn local shoppers $1,000 in cash.

The Rolla Area Chamber of Commerce, as part of its shop local campaign, is inviting people to enter the $1,000 Shop Local Giveaway contest, which runs through the end of the month.

People who shop at five Rolla businesses during the month of May can keep their receipts and hand them into the Chamber to enter. One entry consists of a total of five receipts from five different businesses within the Rolla city limits. People can enter multiple times.

No photocopied receipts wil be accepted. Entries may not include returns, utility payments or lottery tickets. Receipts with purchases of only alcohol or tobacco products will also not be accepted.

Participants must be 18 years or older by April 30, 2014, and live within Phelps County to be eligible.

Chamber Executive Director Stevie Kearse told the Phelps County Commission last month that at the end of the contest, all of the receipts will be totaled to see how much money was kept locally.
