
The Trans-Pacific Partnership and closer military cooperation will be among the talking points when Prime Minister John Key sits down with United States President Barack Obama at the White House next month.

Mr Key has welcomed an invitation to meet Mr Obama in Washington DC during his visit to the US.

"The invitation underlines the very close relationship between the United States and New Zealand," Mr Key said.

"We are likely to discuss the Trans Pacific Partnership negotiations, to take stock of our bilateral relationship, and to exchange views on current regional and international issues."

A White House statement said the June 20 meetings will highlight "our increasingly close relationship with New Zealand" and collaboration on the TPP, climate change and military-to-military co-operation.

Mr Key told reporters New Zealand's anti-nuclear stance - which caused a major rift in relations with the US in the late 1980s and the effective end of the ANZUS security alliance - is no longer an issue.

"The nuclear issue is well and truly passed now, both sides understand each other's position," he said.

Mr Key says it's important for the relationship with the US that the prime minister of the day goes to the White House once a parliamentary term.

He first visited the White House in 2011.

In January, Mr Key and his 18-year-old son Max played golf with the US president after receiving an invitation during Mr Obama's annual Hawaii holiday.

The visit to the White House would provide an opportunity to discuss more formally New Zealand's relationship with the US, Mr Key said.

While in Washington DC, Mr Key will also meet with a range of senior administration figures, Congressional representatives and business leaders.

Mr Key will also head to New York in support of New Zealand's bid to win a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in 2015-16.

The prime minister will be in the US from June 16 to 20.
