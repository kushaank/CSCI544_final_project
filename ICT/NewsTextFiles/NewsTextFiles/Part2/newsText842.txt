
Kigali (Rwanda) - Following reports of alleged missing persons and forced disappearances of some people, the Rwanda National Police (RNP) has dismissed the allegations as "false" and "unfounded." Human Rights Watch last Friday alleged that an "increasing number of people have been forcibly disappeared or have been reported missing in Rwanda since March 2014," putting the number of those missing to 14 so far.

"There are no missing persons and the accusations are false, baseless and have no evidence," Police spokesperson, Assistant Commissioner of Police Damas Gatare, said.

"During the recent operations and investigations to arrest suspects alleged of conspiracy against established government and terror activities, some people were apprehended. It took some time to crackdown on members of this network but we have over 35 suspects who will be handed over to prosecution in Rubavu and Musanze," ACP Gatare explained.

ACP Gatare further explained that the operation to apprehend the suspects was conducted in partnership with the general population, local leaders and other security organs.

He assured the public that security organs enforce laws in a "professional manner and therefore there was no cause for alarm".

He also appealed to the population to continue their cooperation with Police by providing timely information to prevent crimes and ensure safety and security in the country.

The recent subversive activities in the Northern and some parts of the Western Provinces prompted the visit of the Minister of Local Government, James Musoni and the Inspector General of Police, Emmanuel K. Gasana, last month, geared at mobilizing local residents to strengthen security.
