Residents of Newton House in Stanhope, County Durham, were joined by friends, relatives and the wider Weardale community to protest over Durham County Council's decision to close the care home and four others in the county.

PROTESTERS formed a 'circle of tears' around a care home to express their “disgust and disbelief” at its impending closure.

Residents of Newton House in Stanhope, County Durham, were joined by friends, relatives and the wider Weardale community for the peaceful protest today (May 18).

Waving protest banners, the demonstration was in response to a decision by Durham County Council’s cabinet to close the home and four others.

Michelle Robson, whose father-in-law, Donald, 83, is a resident, said: “Last November, we formed a circle of love and protection and now we are forming a circle of love and tears to express our disgust and disbelief that Durham County Council has gone ahead with this.

It costs an extra £22,000 a year per resident to keep people in council-run homes as opposed to the authority paying for them to be placed in independent homes.

Cabinet also voted to close Cheveley House in Belmont, Feryemount in Ferryhill, Grampian House in Peterlee and Mendip House in Chester-le-Street and Newtown House in Stanhope when it met in Crook last month.

Deputy leader Councillor Alan Napier said cuts imposed by the Government were to blame, with funding for services heavily reduced.

Shame it wasn't windy. You could have wee'd(insert swear word here) into the wind.

Such a shame but sadly I fear there is no hope.

There is hope - all these people could, rather than holding a banner do somethign proactive - and donate the money needed to keep their friends/relatives in the home. Of course, that these friends and relatives will not do so and merely want other taxpayers to pay the bills for their friends and relatives speaks volumes.

VOR - as ever the warm and cuddly voice of the nasty party.

Ordinary people, abandoned by a government that does not care.

Tory cuts as ever hitting the weak, the poor and the defenceless, while the rich just keep on getting richer.
