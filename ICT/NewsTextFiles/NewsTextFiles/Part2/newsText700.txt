
A New York City youth who was shot in his eye last month reacted, not with bitterness, but by giving a speech against gun violence Saturday, the New York Daily News reports.

Droiville was with his aunt in the East Flatbush of Brooklyn on April 14 when a bullet struck him in his right eye. Twenty-one year old Kareem Potomont was arrested and charged in the shooting. He was reportedly aiming at a rival. Officials have charged him with attempted murder, reckless endangerment and assault.

Droiville also received a standing ovation for singing the national anthem with his church choir at Citi Field last Thursday.
