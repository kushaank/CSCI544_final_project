
President Barack Obama will be the star attraction at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser hosted by Vogue editor Anna Wintour as well as a major LGBT gala next month, POLITICO has learned.

Invitations to the Wintour-hosted fete on June 17 in New York were recently distributed. The fashion magazine icon was one of Obama’s fundraisers during his 2012 reelection bid.

The president also has been advertised as the headliner for the DNC’s LGBT gala, which falls on the same date and will be held at New York’s Gotham Hall.

“Under this President, we have seen more progress for our community than under any other administration in U.S. History,” read a note to potential attendees of the gala from DNC officials.
