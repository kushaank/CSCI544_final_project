
BEIRUT: President Michel Sleiman asked the Constitutional Council Monday to review the legality of a disputed rent law passed by Parliament last month.

According to his office, the president asked the council to review the "constitutionality" of the bill, which Sleiman refused to sign into law.

Sleiman has said that the bill is unfair and does not further social justice.

The draft law has been at the center of controversy since it was proposed by the Cabinet two years ago, with tenants saying it would displace thousands of families who rent in Beirut under an old law governing lease contracts enacted before 1993.

Inhabitants pay minimal rent fees that often amount to less than LL1,000,000 annually.
