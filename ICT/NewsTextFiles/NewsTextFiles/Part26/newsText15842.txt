
Best Debt Consolidation Loans reviews and shares Louisiana's top debt consolidation companies.

A recent survey undertaken by BestDebtConsolidationLoans.org has identified Louisiana's top three debt relief providers.

This is important because the average Louisianan is having a difficult time with debt. This is evidenced by the fact that the state's average credit card debt is $5345 per borrower. In addition, the state's overall unemployment rate may be only 6.3% but the unemployment rate in New Orleans is 7.9% as is Baton Rouge's unemployment rate.

The costs of fuel, food and housing continue to increase in Louisiana. This has put additional pressure on the state's residents. It is also believed that many of the state's residents are not good at managing their personal finances. When you add to this the state's average credit card debt and unemployment it is easy to see why so many Louisianans are struggling to pay off their debts.

In response to this problem, BestDebtConsolidationLoans.org undertook a review of the debt consolidation loan providers available online to residents of Louisiana. They used six criteria in analyzing these companies. They were customer service, fees, customer satisfaction, debt solution alternatives, business ethics and financial standing. The goal of this research was to determine which of the debt consolidation loan companies available to residents of Louisiana could be trusted to provide ethical services at fair prices to help them become debt free and without being scammed.

Based on its analysis of debt consolidation loan providers BestDebtConsolidationLoans.org identified National Debt Relief, CuraDebt and American Debt Enders as the top three alternatives. A spokesperson for BestDebtConsolidationLoans.org said, "We understand that getting out from under big debt can be difficult. We undertook our review of debt consolidation loan companies to determine which ones could be trusted to provide ethical debt relief to help Louisianans solve their debt problems and without falling prey to con artists.

The BestDebtConsolidationLoans.org analysts named National Debt Relief as the best option due to its affordable charges and high degree of customer satisfaction. They gave National Debt Relief high marks because it has consistently maintained an A rating with the Better Business Bureau and deals with its clients in a very ethical manner. As an example of this, National Debt Relief charges no upfront fees and, in fact, charges its customers nothing until it has settled their debts to their satisfaction and provided them with payment plans that they approved. In addition, the money that the company's customers send to National Debt Relief is put in FDI-insured trust accounts that only they can manage. What this translates into is that National Debt Relief can do nothing with a client's money without his or her approval and consent.

National Debt Relief specializes in working with customers that have more than $7500 in debt. It provides debt consolidation programs custom designed to each customer's needs and its clients are almost always "very satisfied" with the services they receive from this company.

BestDebtConsolidationLoans.org rated the company CuraDebt as the second best option for Louisianans. Its specialty is helping customers who have more than $10,000 in credit card debts. The company is usually able to provide its clients with satisfactory settlements because it has strong working relationships with the credit card companies. In addition, CuraDebt can help its customers with flexible programs that include not just credit card debt reduction but also student loan debts, tax debts and defaulted loans.

Ranked third by BestDebtConsolidationLoans.org is American Debt Endors. While this company has been in business for only about seven years, it has already built a reputation for providing debt relief to individuals and families who owe more than $5000. Its debt counselors have been trained to handle almost all types of credit problems. They are said to be compassionate and responsive and are often even able to help their clients improve their credit scores.
