
Congress partyâ€™s Challa Vamsichand Reddy won the Kalwakurthy assembly seat by a margin of 72 votes in the results announced on Monday night.

Counting of votes was stopped on May 16 after officials could not retrieve the polling data of Jupally polling station in Veldanda mandal of Mahabubnagar district.

Efforts by the engineers from ECIL to rectify the snag did not yield result. The Chief Electoral Officer, Bhanwarlal, then wrote to the Election Commission seeking their advice on the issue.

Repolling was ordered for the particular polling station and counting was taken up this evening. In the counting, Mr. Reddy secured 72 votes more than his nearest BJP rival T. Pujari.

With this the strength of Congress party in Telangana goes up to 21 and it is expected to be main opposition party.
