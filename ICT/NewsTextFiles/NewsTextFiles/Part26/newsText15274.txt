
Augusta - It was just one line, but for Helen Blocker-Adams, it’s the end of the line, officially withdrawing from the Augusta Mayoral race.

"We have had plenty of withdrawals before. I would say, perhaps, none that have been quite this dramatic,” says Richmond County Board of Elections director Lynn Bailey.

For Blocker-Adams, the drama is over. Any votes she received from the nearly 8,000 absentee and early votes will not be counted, and voters will see her name when they get to the voting machines on Tuesday, even though she's no longer in the race for Mayor.

“And, those voting machines will still accept a vote for her, but any votes cast for her tomorrow will also be considered invalid and won't be counted,” says Bailey.

Blocker-Adams suspended her campaign Thursday, but waited Friday and the weekend to officially withdraw., meaning 1,600 advanced votes were cast and some, like Carleton Vaughn’s, going to Blocker-Adams.

“If she does withdraw, your vote will be wasted," I said to Vaughn on Friday.

 “I understand that and I'm perfectly willing for that to happen, he answered.

Former Mayor Willie Mays ran against Blocker-Adams nine years ago, and says her withdrawal could help the candidate considered the front runner, Hardie Davis.

“Being in first in most of the polls that have been taken probably does help him,” said Mays.

Bailey says signs will be posted at all 44 polling sites and on all of the more than 400 voting machines informing voters that Blocker-Adams had withdrawn and any votes she receives will not be counted.
