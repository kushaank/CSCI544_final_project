
An unknown culprit, or culprits, set fire to and destroyed a portable toilet on a playing field near Bakerfield Elementary School in Aberdeen, fire investigators said.

The suspects hit the porta-potty around 11:30 p.m. Saturday, when part of it burned before Aberdeen Fire Department crews were able to extinguish it, Senior Deputy State Fire Marshal Oliver Alkire said Monday.

They "came back and struck it again" around 9:30 p.m. Sunday, Alkire said.

"And this time, it's completely gone," he added.

Two firefighters from the Aberdeen Fire Department responded to the blaze Sunday. It took them five minutes to bring it under control, according to a notice of investigation issued Monday by the Office of the State Fire Marshal.

The fire caused an estimated $1,000 worth of damage to the porta-potty, according to the Fire Marshal's Office report.

"It's currently under investigation," Alkire said of the fire. "We know it's incendiary; we're asking anybody with any type of information to contact us."

Anyone who has information about the fire should call the fire marshal's Northeast Regional Office in Bel Air at 410-836-4844.
