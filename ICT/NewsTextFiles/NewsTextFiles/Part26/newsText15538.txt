
Apt. 78 Cafe & Lounge was busted serving alcohol to underage customers and pouring drinks after hours, police said.

Michael J. Feeney Popular Washington Heights hangout Apt. 78 was shuttered last week. The lounge is located at 4447 Broadway.

A popular Washington Heights hotspot is set to re-open Tuesday after a five-day closure by police.

Apt. 78 Cafe & Lounge was abruptly shuttered last week after it was busted for serving alcohol to underage customers and pouring drinks after hours, police sources told the Daily News.

The local hangout on Broadway, near W. 189th St., twice sold alcohol after 4 a.m. and three times made alcohol sales to undercover auxiliary cops who are under 21, police said.

Its owner, Jose Morales, 35, said he will re-open on Tuesday, after paying a $5,000 fine.

Tony Rodriguez, 52, lives in the building next to Apt. 78 and said he was shocked to see the cozy neighborhood lounge closed.

Jose Morales says Apt. 78 will re-open on Tuesday.

Police, however, said the establishment’s track record is checkered.

On March 9, the business was issued a summons for a fight that culminated in a man being hit with bottle. The lounge also exceeded its 74-person capacity by 40 people on New Year’s Eve, police sources said.

There have been “numerous” 311, 911 and community complaints, according to police.

Morales opened Apt. 78 in 2011.
