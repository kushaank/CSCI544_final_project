
Daniel Carbonell is a 6’3″, 220-pound switch-hitting outfielder with four years of pro experience in Cuba.

FOX Sports’ Ken Rosenthal reported over the weekend that the Mariners and Yankees were two of the five finalists. Neither team has offered the young outfielder a legitimate contract offer at this time.

Carbonell is said to be looking for a four-year deal.  If the Yankees don’t sign him by July 2, Carbonell’s signing bonus will count against the team’s 2014-15 international signing period pool money. Carbonell has impressed scouts with his speed, and power, and is considered by some scouts to be a five-tool talent.
