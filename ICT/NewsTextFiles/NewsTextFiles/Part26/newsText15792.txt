
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Owners of land along the Mississippi River in Louisiana may be eligible for financial and technical assistance with increasing bottomland forest acreage and enhancing water quality under the Wetlands Reserve Easement program, part of the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program.

Eligible land is between the Mississippi River and the river’s primary levees. These lands are called “batture” lands and are in the river’s active floodplain.

Landowners enrolling cropland in the voluntary WRE in Louisiana can receive from $1,260 to $1,995 per acre for placing an easement on the land.

When fully implemented, the program will reduce sediment and nutrients entering waterways, decrease flooding, and improve wildlife and fish habitat in six states.
