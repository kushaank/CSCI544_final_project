
At least four people are dead and five have been wounded after a car bomb has exploded in Nigeria's second most populous city.

Police say the blast happened in a Christian neighborhood of the mainly Muslim city.

The bombing may be the latest act of terror by an extremist Islamic group responsible for the kidnapping of nearly 300 school girls in Nigeria.

This evening in Schenectady, community members will call for the release of those children.

They'll gather on the steps of Schenectadyâ€™s City Hall starting at 5 p.m.
