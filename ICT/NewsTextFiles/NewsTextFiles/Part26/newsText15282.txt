
Ron Lamb, president of Reynolds and Reynolds, said, "Dealers are looking for the tools that support a familiar shopping experience for consumers. Certainly, one of those tools is secure, efficient payment processing with the dealership. As we looked for payment processing solution partners, we looked for companies that shared our vision for the consumer experience, security and advanced technology. We found this in Global Payments, as well as a company with deep experience in their industry."

Global Payments' recent acquisition of PayPros has begun to produce early successes, and this agreement positions the company solidly in the automotive space and highlights the strength of the combined PayPros, Accelerated Payment Technologies (APT) and Global Payments offerings.
