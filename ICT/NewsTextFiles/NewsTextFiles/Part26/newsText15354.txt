
ABBOTTABAD: An anti terrorism court in Abbottabad sent three accused of gang raping a student in Mansehra on a ten day physical remand on Monday.

The accused were presented before the anti terrorism court today where the bench granted physical remand of the accused for ten days to the police.

The culprits have already confessed to the crime in the judicial magistrate’s court following their arrest. They were earlier sent on a four-day physical remand.

The police had incorporated the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) clause in the gang-rape case of the student and produced the rapists before the ATC.

Meanwhile, the lawyers here on Saturday decided not to plead the cases of those accused of raping a girl student.

Members of the District Bar Association (DBA,) in a meeting presided over by the Bar president Munir Hussain Laghmani unanimously adopted a resolution deciding not to defend the accused in the ‘gang-rape’ case.

The lawyers also constituted a panel to provide legal assistance to the victim student.

The lawyers said the government should legislate to make the existing laws dealing with sexual assault against children tougher so that nobody could dare commit such crimes.

Also, students from the Government Girls Middle School in the city held a candle vigil and took out a rally demanding severe punishment for the accused under the Shariah laws. The students holding placards chanted slogans against the accused.
