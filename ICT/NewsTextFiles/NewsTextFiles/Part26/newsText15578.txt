
 BUTTE -- It’s not easy living next to one of the most popular trailheads in the Valley.

Officials say they haven’t decided what to do yet and any changes will have to wait until after summer ends.

The borough’s West Butte Trail, a quick but sometimes steep trip, rewards hikers who gain the Butte’s roughly 880-foot summit with views stretching to Knik Glacier and Knik Arm framed by Chugach and Talkeetna mountain peaks. There’s another, much older trail leading from near the Williams Reindeer Farm side of the Butte that gets about half the use of the newer, borough trail.

The money in the budget for the area doesn’t officially get released until the start of the borough fiscal year on July 1.

 Neighbors in mid-May said the crowding problems grew progressively worse over time but really spiked this month.
