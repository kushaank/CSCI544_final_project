Right Way Elevator Maintenance believes elevators need to be cleaned and serviced more often than quarterly or periodically as many companies have chosen to do so. By cleaning, servicing, adjusting, and maintaining elevators on a monthly basis, Right Way is able to ensure future reliability. From the first appointment, Right Way will clean and lubricate the entire elevator system, and adjust all door-related equipment. This monthly cleaning and adjustment allows them to find parts that need to be repaired or replaced before they fail and cause a shut down of the elevator, requiring a call back or emergency repair. Right Way also offers modernization services to elevators that need to be brought back to code.
