
ST. LOUIS • A security guard at Aldi shot and wounded a suspected shoplifter Sunday who was trying to leave with a cart of meat, authorities say.

The 72-year-old security guard shot the 41-year-old shoplifting suspect in the ankle at about 1:30 p.m. Sunday at the grocery store, at 702 North Kingshighway.

Police say the suspected thief was treated at a hospital and released. He has been arrested but not yet charged.

Police say the young man was leaving Ald with a cart of meat he had not purchased. The guard confronted him. They fought, and the guard tried to stop the man using pepper spray. However, wind blew the pepper spray into the security guard's face.

The shoplifter then punched the security guard in the face, and the guard staggered backward, police say. When the shoplifter came at the guard again, the guard pulled his handgun and fired shots.
