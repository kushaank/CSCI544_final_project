
In sentencing a case last week an Indian judge has confirmed that there are no laws prohibiting marital rape in India.

If a couple is legally married a man can rape his wife and she will have no legal recourse. This is after the new Anti-Rape Bill was passed by government which included stricter laws and punishments for rapists after the brutal gang rape that killed 23 year-old student, Jyoti Singh.

This is a great concern, especially in a country where arranged marriages are the norm and more than 47% of girls are married before they are 18.

As rape usually forms a part of domestic abuse a woman will not be able to accuse an abusive husband of rape until a law against it is passed.
