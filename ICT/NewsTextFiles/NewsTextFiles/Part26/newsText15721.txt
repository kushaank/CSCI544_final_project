
CCHP partnership will provide LISI agents and their clients with an expanded product portfolio, services and providers to all who live and work in the San Francisco Bay area.

LISI, Inc., the premier California General Agency is pleased to announce their newly contracted partnership with Chinese Community Health Plan.

CHHP was created in 1985, when Chinese Hospital obtained a license from the state of California, under the Knox-Keene Act, to develop its own community-based health plan. After establishing an affordable premium rate and a group of physicians able to deliver culturally-appropriate care, CCHP began enrolling members in October 1987.
