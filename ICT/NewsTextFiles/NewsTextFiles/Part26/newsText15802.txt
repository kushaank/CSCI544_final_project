
Appearing on an ABC Sunday morning show, Brown asserted that "We here in California are on the front lines."

Brown reasserted that rising sea levels may precipitate the relocation of Los Angeles International airport (LAX). "We've got to deal with it. We've already appropriated $600 million. We have 5,000 firefighters. We're going to need thousands more. And in the years to come, we're going to have to make very expensive investments and adjust. And the people are going to have to be careful of how they live, how they build their homes and what kind of vegetation is allowed to grow around them."

The website Watts Up With That  pointed out that LAX could be overcome by rising sea levels. However, based on current rising sea level calculations, it will take 45,903.6 years to do it.

It is unclear where Brown got his information from, and he did not give the source for his bold statement. Significantly, most scientists concede that the planet hasn’t been warming since 1998. According to the Sacramento Bee , since 1950 there has been over 7,000 large wildfires in California.
