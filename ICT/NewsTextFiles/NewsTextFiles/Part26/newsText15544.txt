
The government minister was shown a cut-through between Watling Avenue and Silkstream Road which is regularly vandalised and a hotspot for anti-social behaviour.

People living in the area told Mrs May there is a high burglary rate in the area, and people often leave litter and houshold items near to the stream.

Sixty-four-year-old Deirdre Hackett, who has lived in the area since she was two-years-old, said: “In the past few years it’s just been dreadful. The footpath is full of people drinking, doing drugs and rats.

“People used to be jealous saying we’re living in the loveliest road on the estate, but now no one wants to live here anymore.

Residents also told Mrs May about witnessing people sleeping in trees in Silkstream Park, as well as a recent fire near to the footpath.

The MP for Hendon, Matthew Offord, who had invited Mrs May to talk to residents in the Burnt Oak estate, asked if she would be willing to support their campaign to close the footpath.

But Maureen West, who runs the Neighbourhood Watch for the borough of Barnet, said more money needs to be spent in order to more police support.

Mr Offord said he will work with Mrs May’s office in order to close the footpath in the hope it will deter further anti-social behaviour in the area.
