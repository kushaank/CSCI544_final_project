
This Monday the Jubilee Baby gift voting of almost fifteen items were released. Nearly 20,000 votes were casted and more than 6,500 suggestions were given after which it can be concluded that the best Jubilee Baby Gift is a special medallion. With this release the voting exercise has come to an end.

It garnered 61 per cent of the votes, chosen from among 15 items that were short listed for the gift package for babies born next year, said the National Population and Talent Division (NPTD). A multi-functional shawl followed the medallion at about 47 per cent, whereas the baby sling was able to achieve approximately 44 per cent.  A set of baby clothes followed close with 42 per cent along with a diaper bag (41 per cent) and a scrapbook for baby memories (41 per cent).

The NPTD informed that there were two different approaches which people took while choosing the items: Some looked for items that would see the most practical use for parents, while others chose items that would provide historical significance when the baby grew up and looked at the gift some twenty years from now. The Jubilee Baby Gift is a community initiative led by the NPTD as part of the nation’s celebrations to commemorate 50 years of Independence. The actual list of items that make the Jubilee Baby Gift pack are to be announced later this year.
