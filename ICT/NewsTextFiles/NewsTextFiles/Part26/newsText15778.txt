
The Mimika regency administration in Indonesia's Papua province says it will soon dispatch aid relief to a village in the Tembagapura district, which is facing a mounting food crisis.

The regency has been slow to send aid to isolated Jewa village, saying it only learnt about the crisis in the village recently.

The acting regent, Ausilius You, told Antara news agency that the food will be distributed as soon as possible.

Last Wednesday, the Amungme and Kamoro Community Development Institute helicoptered 1,200 kilograms of food into Jewa.
