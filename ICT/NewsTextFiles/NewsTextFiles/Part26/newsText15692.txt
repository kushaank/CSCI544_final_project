
KOTA KINABALU: Malaysian security forces are building up an information base on how southern Philippines gunmen operate before hitting their kidnap targets in Sabah’s east coast.

Eastern Sabah Security Command (Esscom) director general Datuk Mohamad Mantek said on Monday that such data would go a long way in preventing such crimes in the future.

Citing an example, he said the gunmen did not hit their targets directly upon entering Malaysian territory.

Instead, they would hide among villagers at the various islands and wait until their “spotters” at the targeted location gave them the green light to proceed with the kidnapping operation.

“That is why we in Esscom need feedback from local communities about any suspicious activities in their areas,” he said at a dialogue session with representatives of the Kadazandusun Murut community here.

Also present at the event was state Rural Development Minister Datuk Radin Malleh representing Deputy Chief Minister Tan Sri Joseph Pairin Kitingan.

Meanwhile, Mohamad announced a minor restructuring in the Esscom’s organisation with the Operation’s Director’s post being rotated between a police and military representative every six months.

He said the post would initially be assumed by Esscom director of Security and Public Order Datuk Abdul Rashid Harun of the police.

Describing the move as part of internal changes within Esscom, Mohamad said it was aimed at further improving the coordination among all the agencies within Esscom.
