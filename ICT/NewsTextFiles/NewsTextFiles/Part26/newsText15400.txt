
In a letter dated April 16 and April 19 to the secretary of Corporate Affairs, Swamy had written about the two holding multiple DIN, a punishable offence with imprisonment of six months and a fine of Rs 50,000.

In the letter, Swamy said many others also have committed the offence of holding multiple DINs, and he has compiled a list to file criminal cases against all of them.

In case of Karti, the ministry has asked him to explain his position within 15 days.“Vadra has stated that this happened due to inadvertent mistakes which were unintentional,” the ministry said in its reply.

In case of Karti, it said, “… Multiple DIN applications submitted by Shri Karti Chidambaram, the matter has been examined and it is observed that the case prima facie attracts provisions of Section 266 A of Companies Act, 1956. Regional director of this ministry has been asked to call for explanations of Shri Chidambaram as per the established procedure in such cases”.

“Karti Chidambaram has been given 15 days after which the further course of action will be decided in the light of the explanation if any,” the ministry’s reply to Swamy said.

Swamy had also requested the ministry to initiate necessary criminal prosecution against the accused with an intimation to him by the ministry of their actions.
