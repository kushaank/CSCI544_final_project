
Baku- APA . From a cramped office in residential Donetsk, election officials were frantically working on Sunday to prepare for Ukraine's May 25 presidential poll, despite what they described as intimidation and threats from pro-Russian separatists, APA reports quoting Reuters.

By Monday morning, their resolve broken, they had shut down their office.

"It is the interference of these people, who have grabbed the region by force, who have placed checkpoints around the city to protect it from something. We are worried that either tomorrow, either now, either on election day, they will come and stop our work physically," he said.

Later on Monday Klotsky was out of reach at a police station. It was not clear why.

Kiev authorities were adamant the election would go ahead despite the difficulties.

Avakov accused separatists of carrying out "bandit actions" aimed at disrupting the election.
