"We want to be quiet about it. It is about the LGBTI people who live in the society which does not accept them and we want to help them to claim their rights as citizens of Zimbabwe and as citizens of this world and to fully enjoy the rights that were given to them in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to which Zimbabwe is also a member."
