
Plans to set up a small waste-to-energy plant in Safdarjung by the New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) have received criticism by residents of the area with some Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) approaching the Lieutenant-Governor on the issue.

Further, the residents of Green Park feel that traffic congestion in the area will become an “insurmountable problem” once the plant becomes functional.

“Transportation of waste material from the high-profile NDMC areas would add to the vehicular congestion in the area and add to the misery of the residents of Green Park Extension, Green Park Main and Safdarjung Enclave,” the letter states.

According to R N Bhagi, general secretary of Green Park Extension RWA, the plant will become an environmental hazard.

“We have looked at scientific research papers which state that this king of set-up is not supposed to take place near residential areas. There will be dissipation of heat from the plant and the humidity level will also increase owing to the steam produced while burning the waste.

While the plant is expected to increase the supply of electricity in the area, there will also be an increase in consumption of electricity. The increase in humidity and pollution in the area would force residents to use more air conditioners,” Bhagi said.

NDMC officials, on the other hand, claimed that these concerns were baseless.
