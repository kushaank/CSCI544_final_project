
Heichelbech was selected for changing the culture at Triumph Motorcycles America to substantially raise the quality of its customer service and for increasing Triumph’s profitability and that of its network of independently owned dealers.

- Partnered with Bridgeline Digital and UPS to develop and launch an e-commerce platform;

- Exponentially increased Triumph’s marketing outreach impressions;

- Originated the industry’s first free 24/7 Customer Support where a live person at the company’s Atlanta headquarters is available via phone, chat and email.

- Invested in its network of independently owned and operated Triumph retailers to help them better serve retail customers.

Glad to hear the Triumph USA staff is embracing the new culture.  They didn’t really have a choice, upon Heichelbech’s entrance he performed a bulk firing of staff, many with the rich heritage and history he claims to uphold. Great to see Triumph clinging to popular figures such as Steve McQueen and James Dean – are they still relevant?  Grasping at the past will not bring you current.

As a former dealer, I can tell you that it is a terrible time to be a Triumph dealer.

look good on paper for a while until the crap hits the fan just like with the US banks in 2007. Of course the CEO’s got their money at everyone elses expense and I suppose that Greg will eventually get paid to leave when the whole program blows up in Triumph’s face. Maybe I will reconsider the line then.

I hope there won’t be a new book “Whatever Happened To The British Motorcycle Industry Again” the sequal.

Yep. The announcement was made today that he is no longer CEO of Triumph America.  I am absolutely confident that the dealers are celebrating with more glee than they did for Triumph’s 100th Anniversary.

It is truly ironic that just as he wins ” Executive of the Year” from Powersports Business he gets the boot.  That just goes to show you that it is a worthless award.  In fact, if you look at the past history of the award, most winners were not long for their careers with that company after receiving it.

Now that he is gone, maybe instead of trying to make the company mimic the HD culture, living in the past with Steve McQueen, copying BMWs styling, and building terrible cruisers, they can get back to building awesome MODERN motorcycles.

Hot off the motorcycle press. If it’s moto-news, Cycle World will keep you up-to-date.
