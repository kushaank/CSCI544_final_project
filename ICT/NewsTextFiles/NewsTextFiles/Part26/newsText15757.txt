CLOVER, S.C. -- Several Clover High School students were honored Monday afternoon in front of family and friends, recognizing their commitments to serve in the military.

Haydn Matkovich will attend West Point.

It's almost surreal. I applied a long time ago. It's a long application process and to finally get that letter about a month ago was awesome, and now I'm really getting ready to go.

Brady Watson was accepted into the Naval Academy. When asked about his dream he didn't hesitate.

Ever since I was a kid I wanted to become a naval pilot.

He believes students choosing military life share something in common.

Everyone in this room, we're focused. We have a goal, and we're doing what it takes to achieve that goal.  Watson said.

For Audrey Guy, going into the Navy just made sense. Her family has a long tradition of military service.

She said,  I'm doing it because there are people I love and I want to protect them. It gives me a great sense of responsibility in serving my country knowing I'm doing something for others and not just for myself.

While their service will take them around the world, there will always be a little bit of Clover with them.

Brady Watson says,  It's really nice knowing that all these people are supporting me; it will be that much easier at the academy knowing that I have a community behind me.

Most will ship out by early summer. Each student honored Monday was given a journal to help track his, or her adventures.
