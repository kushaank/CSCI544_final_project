WOODSTOCK – A 41-year-old McCullom Lake man faces between six and 30 years in prison after admitting that he impregnated a 12-year-old girl.

Rafael Rodriguez-Sanchez on Monday entered a blind guilty plea – meaning there was no agreement between attorneys on a possible sentence – to predatory sexual assault of a child.

He will be sentenced July 10. Any sentence the judge imposes would be followed by a parole term of anywhere from three years to life.

Assistant State’s Attorney Robert Zalud said the young girl became pregnant after having sexual contact with Rodriguez-Sanchez sometime between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31, 2012.

The girl eventually miscarried. The fetus was tested and DNA evidence would have shown, Zalud said, with 99.9 percent probability that the child was Rodriguez-Sanchez’s.

Rodriguez-Sanchez was not related to, but had lived with the girl in McCullom Lake when the sexual encounter occurred, attorneys said.

Outside the courtroom, Rodriguez-Sanchez’s attorney, Assistant Public Defender Angelo Mourelatos, said the sex was not forced.

In exchange for his guilty plea, a remaining domestic battery charge was dropped.

His plea was accepted by McHenry County Judge Sharon Prather.
