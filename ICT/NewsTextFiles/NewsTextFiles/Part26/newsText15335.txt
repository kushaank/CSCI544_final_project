
A 50-year-old mother and her 52-year-old boyfriend were arrested and charged before the Superior Court of Guam after she failed to protect her daughter from the man who allegedly molested the minor.

The 14-year-old victim reported to school officials that her mother’s boyfriend had sexually assaulted her when she was 8 and 9 years old. She stated that he touched her twice on her private parts. The first was when was alone with him in the residence sitting on the couch when he reached his hand inside her shorts. The second incident was when she was 9 years old and he picked her up after school and she fell asleep on the front passenger seat. The victim said she awoke to his hand on her private area outside the clothing.

When the victim was 12 years old, she finally told her mother what the man had done to her. She also told her mother that she was having bad dreams at night about the abuse and that it made her angry having to see the man regularly.

Her mother confronted her boyfriend shortly after that and put the victim in a different home for a few days. But after those few days, the mother had the victim return to the family home and thereafter allowed the suspect to see the victim daily.

The victim finally told school officials on May 15 that she was tired of feeling bad.

A Guam Police Department officer met with the man who admitted to touching the victim’s private area and that he did so because he was stupid. Officers arrested him and he was charged with two counts of second-degree criminal sexual conduct as a first-degree felony.
