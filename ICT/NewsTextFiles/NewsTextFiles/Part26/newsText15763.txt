
More than 1,000 people took part in Saturday and Sunday's Hope Epidemic in Sikeston. This year's event, which brings together church members from across the area, provided the opportunity for participants to put together meals for "Feed My Starving Children," a non-profit organization which sends meals to the needy.

SIKESTON - It was epidemic.

But those taking part in Saturday and Sunday's Hope Epidemic project for Feed My Starving Children, the symptoms simply infected them with smiles.

Volunteers from churches and organizations across the community worked Saturday and Sunday for the non-profit organization, Feed My Starving Children. As they worked, there was music, there were shouts and there was prayers as more than 1,000 people from various denominations packed what organizers described as "Manna Packs,"  small bags filled with vitamins, vegetables, soy and rice, to be dispersed through relief programs worldwide. This weekend's bags are destined for hungry children in Haiti.

Working shifts, participants began their efforts with registration.

Andy Piepenbrok with the First United Methodist Church was one of those behind the effort which brought 140 people per shift to work in the mobile food packaging effort.

While the effort of Hope Epidemic remains the same to combine area churches in service, this year's event took a slightly different turn, he said. In the past the projects were community oriented -- rehabbing parks, assisting in flood recovery or other local efforts.
