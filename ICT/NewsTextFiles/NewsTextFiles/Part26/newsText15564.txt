
OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media Dunja Mijatovic has condemned the continued harassment of journalists covering the conflict in Ukraine.

In a letter to Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine Arsen Avakov, Mijatović expressed her concern over detention of journalists of Russian online portal LifeNews and asked the authorities to release the journalists and thoroughly investigate the case.

Besides, Russian journalists from various media, including Zvezda, NTV, Perviy Kanal and TVC channels, were denied entry to Ukraine. Reportedly, all journalists were accredited by responsible Ukrainian authorities to cover the presidential election, OSCE said in a statement.

“Journalists must be free to do their job without fear for their safety. In times of conflict the plurality of voices and opinions are needed more than ever in order for the citizens to be informed,” Mijatović said.
