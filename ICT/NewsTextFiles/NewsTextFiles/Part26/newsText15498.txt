
An open letter sent to President Barack Obama by a group of 44 former top U.S. government officials and advocates of policy reform calls on the White House to expand licensed travel for all Americans to Cuba and increase support for civil society on the communist-ruled island, Reuters reports .

The letter, which also called on the White House to engage in “serious discussions” with the Cuban government on security and humanitarian issues, is the latest sign of increased pressure on the Obama administration to soften the U.S. Cold War-era policy on Cuba.

Reducing U.S. restrictions on travel and financial activity in Cuba would help “deepen the changes already underway by giving greater freedom to private organizations and individuals to directly and indirectly serve as catalysts for meaningful change in Cuba,” the letter, signed by John Negroponte, former Director of National Intelligence under president George W Bush, retired Admiral James Stavridis, as well as several former senior State Department officials, reads.

The letter also states that any talks with the Cuban government, should be used as “leverage” to help secure the release of jailed U.S. government contractor Alan Gross, who is serving a 15-year jail sentence in Cuba.
