
Retired Sen. Joe Bruno says two trials and appeals cost him more than $4 million. He had been charged with taking bribes to direct state grants to a businessman.

State law authorizes reimbursement of "reasonable" attorneys' fees for officials accused of criminal wrongdoing while acting within the scope of their duties.

The 85-year-old Bruno tells an Albany media outlet that overly zealous federal prosecutors cost him six years of his life and they probably spent $25 million to $30 million.

A businessman testified he hired Bruno as a consultant and that the payments were NOT bribes.

Bruno, a Rensselaer County Republican, led the Senate majority for 14 years before stepping down in 2008.
