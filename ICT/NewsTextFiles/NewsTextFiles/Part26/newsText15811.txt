A Coates Bend man died in a fire Sunday morning but foul play is not suspected, Etowah County Sheriff Todd Entrekin said.

William Simmons, 59, died in a mobile home fire at 103 Speedy Lane near Gadsden in the Coates Bend community while another person who was in the residence at the time escaped uninjured. The fire is under investigation but arson has been ruled out.

The fire happened around 9 a.m. Sunday and when firefighters arrived, the mobile home was completely engulfed. The Alabama Fire Marshal’s Office and Etowah County Arson Task Force are working to conclude how the fire started.

Simmons has been sent to the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences for an autopsy. The Coates Bend Volunteer Fire Department, Tidmore Bend Volunteer Fire Department, A-Med Ambulance and Etowah County Coroner’s Office all assisted on the call.
