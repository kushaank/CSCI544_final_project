
PLATTSMOUTH – Two Plattsmouth residents pled guilty to methamphetamine-related charges in separate district court cases Monday morning.

Nicole D. Ranburger, 42, appeared in the first case in Cass County District Court. Ranburger pled guilty to a Class I misdemeanor count of attempted possession of controlled substance-methamphetamine. The state agreed to reduce its original Class IV felony charge in exchange for the guilty plea. There was no agreement regarding sentencing.

Deputy County Attorney Richard Fedde told the court Plattsmouth police visited Ranburger’s residence Dec. 14 after they received a report of a domestic argument. Officers reported Ranburger displayed signs of meth use when they attempted to speak with her.

Officers located a pipe and residue under a blanket on the property. Workers at the state crime lab later identified the residue as methamphetamine.

Troy A. Pedersen, 51, appeared in the second case. He pled guilty to a similar Class I misdemeanor of attempted possession of controlled substance-methamphetamine. The state will recommend probation as part of the plea agreement.

Deputy County Attorney Steven Sunde told the court Plattsmouth police visited Pedersen’s residence Dec. 11 with a search warrant. Police seized several items in the house that indicated the presence of drugs.

Officers sent a straw with white residue on it to the state crime lab for testing. The lab identified the white residue as methamphetamine.

Sentencing in both cases will take place July 21. Ranburger and Pedersen are both free on bond.
