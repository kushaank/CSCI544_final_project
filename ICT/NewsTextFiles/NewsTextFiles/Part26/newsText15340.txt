A Wyoming County assistant district attorney arrested over the weekend following a domestic dispute over the weekend has been fired.

Marshall A. Kelly, 33, of Attica was allegedly involved in a domestic dispute in an Attica residence Sunday morning, according to Wyoming County Sheriff Gregory Rudolph. Details of the incident were not immediately available, but a woman was injured during the dispute, which occurred about 10:15 a.m., deputies said.

Kelly was charged with second-degree criminal trespass and third-degree assault, both misdemeanors, Rudolph said.

The second assistant district attorney for Wyoming County, Kelly worked for the office for just over four years, said Wyoming County District Attorney Donald O’Geen.

“My office has always taken a strong stance against domestic violence and this type of behavior will not be tolerated in any form,” O’Geen said in a written statement.

Genesee County District Attorney Larry Friedman will be prosecuting the case for the Wyoming County DA’s Office.

Kelly was released after he was arraigned in Attica Village Court. An order of protection was issued for the involved woman, deputies said. Kelly is slated to return to court next month.
