
WEST PALM BEACH - Drivers may have to pay more to fill up for Memorial Day weekend compared to last year, according to the American Automobile Association.

Gas prices have been going down over the past month, but AAA doesn't think the prices will drop enough for drivers to pay less this year compared to 2013.

The current average for a gallon of regular gas in Florida is $3.64. That's compared to last year's average of $3.48.

AAA doesn't think the price of gas will be enough to stop people from taking trips.

Other travel expenses are expected to rise along with gas.

AAA says the average cost of a hotel room will be $169 compared to $166 a year ago.

The cost of renting a car is up to $44, up 1 percent compared to 2013.

Airfare is seeing the largest boost, according to AAA, at $227 for a round trip discounted ticket, on the top 40 routes in the US.  That's up from $215 a year ago.

AAA has a mobile app that will help travelers figure out the cheapest way to travel. To learn more go to AAA.com/mobile.
