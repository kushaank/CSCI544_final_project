
BERKELEY (CBS SF) — The body of a man found near Grizzly Peak on University of California at Berkeley campus Sunday afternoon has been identified by the Alameda County coroner’s bureau as 22-year-old Concord resident Lorenzo Baltazar-Trujillo.

At about 2:20 p.m. Sunday, a female hiker found Baltazar-Trujillo’s body at the base of a 100-foot cliff near a popular hiking spot, UC Berkeley police said.

The hiker tried to give first aid to the man but then realized he was deceased.

She notified police, who responded and did not find any signs of foul play.

Investigators have not reported any signs of foul play and believed the death was unintended.

A person died at almost the same location last year, but witnesses were present during that incident.

UC Berkeley police were not immediately releasing more information about Baltazar-Trujillo’s death as of this morning.
