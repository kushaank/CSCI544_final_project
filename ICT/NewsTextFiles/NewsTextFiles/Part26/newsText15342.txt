
An explosion in the Port Harcourt Refinery Jetty in Okrika Local Government Area of Rivers State on Sunday feared to have killed at least seven people, while leaving many others seriously injured.

The explosion was reportedly triggered by pipeline vandals and oil thieves, who had allegedly tampered with one of the pipelines near the refinery to steal petroleum products.

Tamuno Williams, chairman of Okrika Local Government Area, accused the Pipelines & Product Marketing Co (PPMC) of being negligent. He alleged that oil thieves had been committing the crime with the help of some PPMC officials. The PPMC is a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp (NNPC).

Ralph Ugwu, Executive Director (Services) at the NNPC, confirmed the incident and claimed that the incident had no impact on the company's refining operations.

Speaking on the tragedy, he said, "The incident has no impact on our operations whatsoever and, on our own side as NNPC, there is no casualty and the incident has no impact on our refining operations or on our jetty operations."

He added that fate caught up with the pipeline vandals as their boat exploded and caught up in fire. The fire didn't affect the main refinery as fire service officers managed to put it out before it could enter the refinery.
