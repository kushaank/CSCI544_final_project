
The police in Lagos on Monday arraigned a 32-year-old man, Kelvin Robert, over alleged conspiracy and armed robbery, after six years in police custody.

The accused appeared before a Lagos High Court sitting at Igbosere, on a two-count charge.

He allegedly committed the offences on March 11, 2008 at the Tin-Can Island, Apapa, Lagos, at 7.30p.m.

According to the charge sheet, Robert and some others, still at large, conspired and robbed Mrs Deborah Davies of jewellery, mobile phones and other valuables at gunpoint.

The police said that the offences contravened Sections 402 and 406 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2011.

Robert, however, pleaded not guilty to the two-count charge.

His Counsel, Mr C.C. Ekpobosa, expressed dissatisfaction that the accused was being charged to court after six years of arrest.

“The man had been in custody since 2008. That is, six years wasted out of his lifetime,” he said.

Too bad and extremely unlawful to detain any suspect more than the required time depending on the case.Even if the crime was committed he has already served his term and those police men in charge such be punished to serve as a deterant to others or we continue to swim as a nation in mediocracy.

I strongly condemn his continued detention but will also condemn him for being an armed robber…..People who make life unbearable for their neighbours shall never find peace.

Is he truly an armed robber ? If yes, let the law take its full course.
