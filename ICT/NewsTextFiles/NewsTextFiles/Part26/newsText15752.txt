
CEDAR RAPIDS | More than three-fifths of likely Republican primary election voters would like to maintain the party’s plank affirming traditional marriage, according to poll results released Monday.

Nearly a quarter of the 600 Iowa Republicans polled agreed that government shouldn’t have a role in marriage – a position taken by delegates to the 1st District Republican convention.

The 20-county 1st District includes Cedar Rapids, Cedar Falls-Waterloo and Dubuque.

Just 10 percent favored altering the state party’s platform to reflect the legalization of same-sex marriages by the Iowa Supreme Court decision in the 2009 Varnum v. Brien case, according to the Loras College Poll conducted by phone May 12-13.
