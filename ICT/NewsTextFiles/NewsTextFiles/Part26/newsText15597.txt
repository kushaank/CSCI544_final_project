
June 3, voters will decide on a $67.4 million budget.  The mayor says the school board is getting the message that residents do not want higher taxes, and have worked to make cuts.  He says it's time to pass a budget, and says the board is just getting started.

"I want to be clear that I am well aware that the board has much more work ahead to put the school district on sound financial footing and control the unsustainable tax increases of recent years," said Weinberger.

But he says that takes time.  Too many cuts  instated too quickly could be too big a pill for the school system to swallow at once.

"Our community is very fortunate to have the excellent public school system we enjoy and I am concerned that too many cuts too quickly and without a deliberate strategy will do lasting damage to that system, particularly in the programs and services that directly impact our children," said Weinberger.

He pointed out that the board has new leadership now, and he asks voters to pass this budget and give them time to do a good job making hard cuts.

Absentee ballots will not be automatically mailed out, but voters can come to City Hall during business hours before June 3 and cast their ballot.
