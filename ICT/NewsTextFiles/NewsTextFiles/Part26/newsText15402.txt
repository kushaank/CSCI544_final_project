
IBADAN–Oyo State Police Commissioner, Mr. Mohammed Indabawa said yesterday that the prime suspect in the Soka kidnappers’ den in Ibadan was yet to be arrested.

He said this while speaking with newsmen at the State Police command, Eleyele, Ibadan.

The CP also hinted that three suspects had already been arraigned before a magistrate court in connection with the incident.

He dismissed rumour that the incident had been swept under the carpet.

While pledging that the police would get to the root of the matter, he advised residents in the city not to hoard any information at their disposal but should always keep the police informed about any criminal activities in the state.

Justifying that the police were working round the clock to get all the suspects arrested, he added that it was the efforts of his men and officers of the state command that led to the arrest of seven suspects.

Meanwhile, when Vanguard visited the kidnappers’ den, the directive given by Governor Abiola Ajimobi that all structures on the land be demolished was yet to be complied with.

Vanguard gathered that since the day the police authorities ordered that the demolition be put on hold for forensic experts to collect samples, nothing concrete has been done.

When asked why the structures had not been demolished, the Special Adviser to the governor on media, Dr. Festus Adedayo said they were still waiting on the police to conclude investigations.

For fear of being turned to hoodlums’ hideouts, residents in the area have made a fresh appeal to the governor to ensure that the place be cleared.

Speaking to Vanguard, the community leader in the area, Mr. Isiaka Bello Olupoju said since the bulldozer left the scene about three months ago, there was nothing done on the land again.

“We are afraid that the place could be used by hoodlums again. As you can see,” he said.
