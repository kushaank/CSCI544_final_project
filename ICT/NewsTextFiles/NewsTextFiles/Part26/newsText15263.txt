
HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (WSAZ) -- A convicted felon is facing more prison time for having a gun on him when his girlfriend's Huntington home was raided earlier this year.

William Isiah Petties, 33, of Huntington, was arrested on January 20 at a home in the 1100 block of 28th Street.

The home belonged to Petties' girlfriend, but investigators say that he stayed there on a regular basis.

Monday Petties pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm as a convicted felon.

The DEA says a .40 caliber pistol was found in the home during their search, and since Petties stayed there, and he had been convicted of aggravated robbery in 2000, he was not able to be in possession of a gun.

Petties had been named as one of 15 defendants indicted for various offenses connected with drug trafficking activities of Kenneth Dewitt Newman, aka "K-Kutta". According to the US Attorney's Office, Newman, along with others, distributed cocaine, heroin, MDMA, marijuana and prescription pills in Huntington.

He faces 10 years in prison and up to $250,000 fine when he is sentenced in August.
