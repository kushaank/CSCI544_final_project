
No means no, people.

Jarrett believes Boehner will allow a comprehensive immigration reform bill, or a package of bills, to come up for a vote after the primary election to avoid spoiling some GOP candidates’ chances.

Jarrett said the White House doesn’t care if immigration reform is accomplished in one bill or multiple bills, which is preferred by Republicans leery of omni­bus legislation.

Michael Steel, a spokesman for the Ohio Republican, said Boehner has not made a commitment to the White House.

“Republicans are committed to reforming our immigration system, but as the speaker has said repeatedly, it’s difficult to see how we make progress until the American people have faith that President Obama will enforce the law as written,” Steel said in an email.

If ever there was a bill to appeal to Republicans, this is it: Republican sponsor. Vulnerable district. Bi-partisan bill. Military service. Appeal to an ethnic group that the Republican Party needs badly to attract for its long-term success.

But no.

Yes, things could change after primary elections. But it’s not looking good.
