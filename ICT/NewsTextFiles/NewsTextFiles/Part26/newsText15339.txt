
A Utah lawmaker wants to resurrect firing squads as a method of execution after a botched lethal injection in Oklahoma.

Republican Rep. Paul Ray says firing squads would be a quick and humane way to put someone to death, especially as lawsuits and drug shortages have complicated lethal injections.

Ray plans to introduce his proposal during Utah's next legislative session in January. Similar efforts have stalled in Missouri and Wyoming.

Utah last used a firing squad in 2010, when five police officers with .30-caliber Winchester rifles executed Ronnie Lee Gardner. Under current law, death by firing squad is only an option for criminals sentenced to death before 2004.
