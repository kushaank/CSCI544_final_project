
Violence continues to rage across the Iraqi capital Baghdad between pro- and anti-government militias.

At least 10 people were killed and 11 others injured on Monday in separate attacks in the Iraqi capital Baghdad, a security source said.

Three people were killed and five others injured when a roadside bomb exploded in the predominantly Sunni Ghazaliya district of Baghdad, said the source, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

Two pro-government Sahwa gunmen were also killed and six others injured in an attack by unidentified assailants on their checkpoint in Abu Ghraib in western Baghdad, he added.

The source said five bodies of slain civilians were found with gunshot wounds in the Hussainia and Zafraniya districts of the capital.

Recent months have seen an uptick in violence across Iraq. Although most attacks go unclaimed, Iraqi authorities usually point the finger at Al-Qaeda-linked rebels.
