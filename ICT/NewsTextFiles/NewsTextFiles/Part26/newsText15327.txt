
A New Canaan man was arrested again on Sunday evening, May 18, for violating a protective order and trespassing — the same charges he faced after an arrest in March . This time he was held on a $500,000 bond.

Vito A. Luciano, 41, of 66 Osborn Lane was charged with violating a protective order and trespassing after his wife went to police headquarters on Sunday. She told police that she and Luciano were both at a school event on Friday, May 16, and he tried to speak with her there and phoned her afterward “numerous times,” according to New Canaan Police Sgt. Carol Ogrinc. Under terms of the protective order, Luciano may contact his wife only by email or text message — and then only if it pertains to their children.

He allegedly continued trying to call and send texts to his wife on Saturday, May 17, police said. Luciano then returned to the residence the following day and “was in the driveway yelling to his wife,” Orginc said, and his wife decided to go to the police.

Officers contacted Luciano, and he turned himself in to police at about 6:40 on Sunday evening, May 18, but denied having violated the protective order. He was charged with first-degree criminal trespassing and violation of a protective order and held on a $500,000 bond. Luciano was transported to Norwalk Superior Court on Monday morning, May 19; before  that, he had been scheduled to appear in court on Wednesday, June 4, in connection with the charges from March.

In that earlier incident , Luciano was arrested on Wednesday, March 26, after he allegedly went to speak with his wife the day before at a residence where she was staying. That would violate a standing protective order, and when he was seen around the same residence on March 26, police swept the area, found him in his vehicle at the YMCA nearby on South Avenue and arrested him there.
