(TRNS)- Having inside the Beltway experience appeals to fewer potential 2016 voters than being a new-comer, according to a Pew Research Poll released Monday.

30 percent of respondents said that they would be less likely to vote for a candidate with Washington experience while just 19 percent said that they would be more inclined. 48 percent said that it wouldnâ€™t matter.

The poll also showed that serving as Governor bodes better for a potential candidate than serving as a business executive. 33 percent said being Governor would make them more likely to back a candidate while 5 percent said less. Similarly, 33 percent said being an executive would boost their support but 13 percent said it would make them less likely to back a candidate.

The poll was conducted between April 23rd and 27th among 1,501 respondents.
