
RESIDENTS affected by the oil spill that came ashore in La Brea last December took to the streets in protest again yesterday, claiming their health was suffering while the authorities were avoiding responsibility.

However, La Brea Member of Parliament Fitzgerald Jeffery said he did not want protest action to escalate and asked that “good sense prevail”.

 Jeffery said residents were not equipped with proper respiratory gear since the spill and he is now worried about the long-term health risks.

He said an immediate evacuation and relocation of affected residents was required and suggested several places to accommodate them.

Resident Tenesha Modeste, 27, said since the oil spill she has had a severe allergic reaction and a rash has formed on her skin.

She said her five-year-old  son also had a similar allergic reaction from inhaling the chemical used to clean the                    oil.

She said she does not have the money to relocate and wanted the State to compensate her for the damage being done by its neglect.

Petrotrin has denied that the chemical used in the clean-up was harmful.
