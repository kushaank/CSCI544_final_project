
Timothy Geithner speaks about the country's economy in Los Angeles.

For former Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner, handling the financial crisis felt like landing a burning plane, and in the process of saving the economy, he says the government lost the country.

“It's like you're in the cockpit of the plane – your engine's burning, smoke's filling the cabin, it's filled with a bunch of people that are fighting with each other about who's responsible, you have terrorists on the plane and people want you to come out of the cockpit and put them in jail. And you have to land the plane.” he told NPR in an interview about the book.

That is why Geithner claims he, and the Obama administration, lost the country in the process of saving the economy.

Going into the crisis, Geithner said he knew it would be “terrible” and tried to talk the President out of asking him to take the job.

His lack of gray hair and gravitas made him look like a boy at his Bar Mitzvah, and his first public speeches and TV interviews were disasters, Geithner says.

And yet, looking back on his tenure as captain leading the country out of the rough waters of recession, Geithner writes in his book that he has few regrets.

Readers, of course, can judge for themselves after reading “Stress Test,” Geithner’s account of how a “reluctant warrior” and uninspiring public speaker lacking “gray-haired gravitas” forged a painful and controversial path out of a potentially disastrous financial crisis.
