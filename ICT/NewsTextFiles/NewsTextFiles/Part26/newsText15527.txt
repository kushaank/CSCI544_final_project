Commissioners’ Chairman Barry Jacobs said that he is pleased with the board’s decision.

“We’re very pleased Bonnie Hammersley is coming to Orange County as our new manager,” Jacobs said in a statement. “Ms. Hammersley possesses impressive experience, has worked in a progressive community and brings a striking combination of competence, confidence and thoroughness.

“She is a good listener and by all accounts a hard worker and an adept pracitioner of the collaborative skills we value,” Jacobs said.

More than 50 people from 15 states applied for the position.
