
The students along with their teachers demanded severe punishment for the accused under the Shariah laws. Holding placards, the demonstrators chanted slogans against the accused who allegedly raped the intermediate student in a moving car.

Earlier, the Anti-Terrorism Court handed over three accused to the police on 10 days physical remand. The accused were produced before the court where the judge granted physical remand of the accused for 10 days. The culprits have already confessed to the crime in the judicial magistrate's court following their arrest.

The District Bar Association through a unanimously adopted resolution decided not to defend the accused in the gang rape case. Bar president Munir Hussain Laghmani chaired the meeting in which the lawyers also constituted a panel to provide legal assistance to the victim student.

The lawyers said that the government should legislate to make the existing laws dealing with sexual assault against children tougher so that nobody could dare commit such crimes.
