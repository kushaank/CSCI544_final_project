During two days of operations taking place in more than 10 countries worldwide, coordinated by Eurojust in The Hague and supported by the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) at Europol, creators, sellers and users of BlackShades malware were targeted by judicial and law enforcement authorities.

During both action days, 300 house searches were carried out worldwide, and 81 people were arrested. Over 1000 data storage devices suspected of being used in illegal activities were seized, including computers, laptops, mobile telephones, routers, external hard drives and USB memory sticks. Substantial quantities of cash, illegal firearms and drugs were also seized.

A recent case in the Netherlands of BlackShades malware being used for criminal purposes was that of an 18-year-old man who infected at least 2000 computers, controlling the victims webcams to take pictures of women and girls.

Countries that undertook action against creators, sellers and users of the malware included the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, UK, Finland, Austria, Estonia, Denmark, USA, Canada, Chile, Croatia and Italy.

Three coordination meetings were held at Eurojust prior to the action days, attended by most of the involved countries. During the action days, a coordination centre was set up at Eurojust, assisting the different countries by delivering overviews of the state of play in the countries involved, as well as providing judicial assistance, if needed. Representatives of Eurojust, Europols EC3 and the FBI were present at the coordination centre.

As a further demonstration of the level of cooperation achieved by this coordination centre, Europols EC3 was present during the action days, and provided real-time analytical support. EC3 will be instrumental in the follow up, identifying victims and analysing data.
