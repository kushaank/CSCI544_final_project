On saturday, May 24 the Sunshine Coast Hinterland branch of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) will hold a community meeting to discuss the effects on our local community of the Abbott government’s federal budget.

Despite the Australian economy being the envy of the western world, vital infrastructure and services such as medicare, education, superannuation and the ABC all face cuts, while household budgets face a raft of increases.

In an effort to raise awareness and open the discussion about the ramifications of this budget on the people of our region the Sunshine Coast Hinterland branch of the ALP will hold a community meeting on Saturday, May 24 at the Maleny Neighbourhood Centre. Guest speaker for the event is Bernie Ripoll MP, the Shadow Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, Shadow Minister for Sport, Shadow Minister Assisting the Leader for Small Business.

An experienced financial spokesperson who worked as a Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer in the previous Labor Government, Mr Ripoll will cut through the spin and rhetoric to outline the changes in Federal Treasury policy and how that will impact upon our bank balances and government services.
