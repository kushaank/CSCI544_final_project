Gardaí have arrested a 41-year-old man in relation to a carjacking involving a mother and two children in Terenure, south Dublin on Friday.

The incident took place on Friday afternoon at about 3.40pm when the woman was stopped at traffic lights at the junction of Zion Rd and Orwell Rd.

A man got into the back of her grey BMW estate, threatened her and demanded money from her. The woman later told gardaí she sounded the horn when he jumped into the car.

The man claimed to have a weapon and told her to drive to her home and retrieve her bank cards. After she did this he told her to drive to an ATM at the AIB bank in Rathgar and withdraw money at about 4.05pm.

After this the man forced her to drive to Portobello and at this point he left the car. The woman and her children were not injured during the incident.

Gardaí described the man as 5’9” (1.75m), had shaved dark hair, an unshaven face, was of medium build and wearing a dark wax jacket and dark scarf.

Gardaí have appealed for anyone who was close to the junction of Zion Rd and Orwell Rd around 3.40pm and saw a suspicious man or anyone who saw unusual behaviour near the AIB Bank ATM in Rathgar between 4.05pm and 4.10pm to contact them in Terenure on 01-6666400, the Garda Confidential Line on 1800-666111 or any Garda station.
