Semi-automatic rifle.

Gary Kiehne, a Republican candidate for Congressional District 1, said in a public debate that mass shooters are 99 percent Democrats.

Really.

It's one of those horrid myths that must constantly be debunked (as in this article ), but is still believed by the fringe.

It's a little disconcerting to hear it spewed by a candidate for Congress.

According to the Arizona Daily Star , Kiehe, who apparently brags about owning more guns and ammunition than the other candidates in the race, said that when it comes to mass shootings,  "if you look at all the fiascos that have occurred, 99 percent of them have been by Democrats pulling their guns out and shooting people," Kiehne said to an audience of about 60 people. "So I don't think you have a problem with the Republicans."

"This past weekend, I made a comment about the political affiliation of perpetrators of gun violence in the heat of a debate. I've since learned that the information that I based the comment off of was inaccurate and incorrect.

"I've always believed that when you make a mistake, you should own up to it. Too many politicians today offer nothing but spin and excuses when they say something they shouldn't have. I'm not going to do that. Simply put, I shouldn't have made the comment, and I want to offer my apology for making it without any reservations."

The way the world works -- at least the way the online world works -- Kiehe's original comment will be used by some to reaffirm the falsehood and spread the ugly myth.

Is the "heat of a debate" reason enough to say -- without first checking -- that "99 percent" of mass shooting are by Democrats and so add, "So I don't think you have a problem with Republicans?"
