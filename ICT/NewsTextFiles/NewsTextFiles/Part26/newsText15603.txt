HALIFAX – Voters rejected a tax increase for a proposed senior center and also said no to making the job of treasurer collector an appointed position in Saturday’s town election.

Voters also returned incumbents to seats on the elementary and Silver Lake school committees and re-elected Highway Surveyor Robert Badore.

The vote was 709-472 against the proposal.

Also defeated was a ballot question which would change the job of town treasurer/collector from an elected to an appointed position. That vote was 628 to 488.

Badore won re-election over Gordon Andrews by a vote of 631 to 532.
