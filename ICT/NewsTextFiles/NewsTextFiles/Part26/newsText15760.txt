KNX 1070’s Claudia Peschiutta reports Monday is the deadline for those who want to have a say in who will be the next Governor of California or the next LA County Sheriff on the June 3 ballot.

About 73 percent of residents eligible had registered to vote as of last month, with 44 percent of total voters registered as Democrats and about 29 percent were registered as Republicans, officials said.

Over six million residents eligible to vote had failed to sign up as of April, according to a report from the Secretary of State’s office.
