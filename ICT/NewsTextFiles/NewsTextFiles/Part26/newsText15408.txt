BIRMINGHAM, Alabama  - A judge today ordered the Birmingham Jefferson County Transit Authority and one of its drivers to turn over certain information and documents to the parents of a  25-year-old special needs student killed when she was struck by a MAX DART in March.

Attorneys for Farjadi, the mother, and Bahri, the father, filed a motion in court on March 26 asking for a variety of documents related to the bus, the incident, the and driver's history, plus the video-taped deposition of bus driver Alex James Mixon, as they prepare to file a wrongful death lawsuit.

Judge King ordered that the documents be turned over to the family by the end of the day on May 30.

The judge noted in his order that there was no opposition to the document request. Today's order from King does not specifically address ordering a video-taped deposition, Mike Kendrick, an attorney for the family, said that will be worked out too.
