
BISSAU, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Guinea-Bissau voters went to the polls on Sunday in a presidential run-off to choose between two candidates in a bid to turn a new chapter in the west African nation after a 2012 military coup.

Jose Mario Vaz, a former finance minister who won the first round in April but failed to secure an outright majority, faces runner-up and independent candidate Nuno Gomes Nabiam.

About 700,000 voters are expected to cast their ballots at polling stations across the country, which opened at 07:00 a.m. local time and close at 17:00 p.m. local time.

The run-off is monitored by some 200 international observers and guarded by the presence of 5,000 security personnel.

Guinea-Bissau's electoral law stipulates that preliminary results be announced within seven to 10 days after the vote.

Guinea-Bissau held the first presidential and legislative elections on April 13 since a military coup upended the impoverished west African country in 2012.
