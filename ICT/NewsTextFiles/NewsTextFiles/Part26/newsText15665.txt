Cincinnati’s famed Graeter’s ice cream is continuing its northern expansion, with plans for a location in Fishers.

Franchise owner Jim Tedesco said it’s too soon to say when the shop will open at Fishers Marketplace, the mixed-use                               project under construction at State Road 37 and 131st Street.

But plans call for the shop to occupy 1,900 square feet of space alongside tenants such as chicken chain Zaxby’s and Bagger Dave’s Legendary Burger Tavern.

Graeter’s opened its first Indiana location this year at 5560 N. Illinois St. in the Butler-Tarkington neighborhood.                               The ice cream chain has about 40 shops, mostly in Ohio and Kentucky, and sells its product grocery stores in 46 states.

Founded in 1870, Graeter’s produces its ice cream in two-gallon batches using French pot freezers and a team of “artisans” that mix each flavor by hand. The company says its creamy texture is the result of freezing the ice cream slowly.

Its best seller: Black raspberry chocolate chip, made with Oregon black raspberries and Peter’s Chocolate chips.

This year, the family-owned firm launched its first significant product expansion, introducing gelato and reduced-sugar ice                               cream.

Graeter's will give Handel's a run for it's money.

Best ice cream I've ever tasted, bar none!

Handles isn't even in the same league graeters. Graeters ids the best in the world.

With out a doubt Graeters is a class itself!

Hands down, Graeter's will win. Handel's is awesome, but not top-tier, like Graeter's!

I'm from Cincy and grew up on the stuff. Black Razz Chip will change your life!

In my book, nothing compares to Handels. Had them both and I'm staying loyal!
