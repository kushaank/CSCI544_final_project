Egyptian expats in the UAE have expressed their pleasure over Egypt’s higher Election Committee’s decision to extend the voting process of the presidential election 2014 by one more day, till Monday, May 19 instead of Sunday as scheduled, Shuaib Abdulfattah, Media Counselor at the Embassy of Egypt, said.

This decision will enable a large number of Egyptian expatriates to cast their votes in such a conclusive election in the history of Egypt, Shuaib added.

“The number of voters was increasing especially after the end of their official working hours at government and private sectors,” he noted.

Voters thronged the premises of both diplomatic missions especially in the evening till the doors close at 9:00 pm. “When the clock ticks 9 pm, the embassy and consulate’s doors close. We allow the voters appearing within the premises to cast their votes even if it is late,” Shuaib stated.

As many as 23,000 expats cast their votes so far at the Egypt’s Consulate in Dubai– excluding voters at the Egyptian embassy in Abu Dhabi–since the poll began on Thursday morning.
