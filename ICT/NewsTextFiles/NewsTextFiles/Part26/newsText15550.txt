
But in Missouri, the process is not so clear-cut.

Every two years, following a voter canvass, between 22,000 and 28,000 voter registrations are kicked back to the St. Louis Election Board.

St. Louis Republican Director of Elections Gary Stoff tells KMOX that a voter canvass is sent out to weed out thousands, revealing if the voters still live in the county in which they’re registered.

“The next step is, pursuant to state statute, we will then send a second mailing, but it will be a forwardable mailing,” Stoff says.

Stoff explains what you should do if you’ve moved since the last time you voted.

“We include a postage paid return envelope so they can send us that information, or if they’ve moved outside the city they correct their information and send it back to us, then we can update our voter registration records,” he says.

But in Missouri, even if you do not provide updated information when the voter canvass is conducted, you will not be purged from the records for two years.

Counties throughout Illinois are purging their voter rolls as well.

East St. Louis by statute has its own election board. Clerk Kandrise Mosby says they purge during odd years. Last year’s effort purged about 2,100 from the rolls, leaving just over 20,000 registered voters.

In St. Clair County, Clerk Tom Holbrook says a total voter purge is expensive—$100,000 alone to mail change of address cards.

This voter purge culled 25,000 from the rolls. It’s the first time an entire purge has been completed in eight years, he says.
