
Residents looking to play a more active role in their neighborhoods and the Durham community will get their chance to learn how at the 2014 Durham Neighborhood College, a class designed specifically for residents to learn about the organization, operations, and services of their city and county governments.

Applications are now available for the 2014 Durham Neighborhood College. This series of classes, co-sponsored by the City and County of Durham, consists of interactive sessions facilitated by local government officials, allowing residents to learn about key government operations directly from the elected officials and staff responsible for overseeing key city and county services.

The final day to apply for this year’s session is June 30. All applicants must be current in their vehicle and property taxes at the time of application.

The classes will be held on nine Thursday nights beginning September 11, from 6 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.  Space in the Durham Neighborhood College is limited to 30 people. Applications will be accepted to create a diverse participant population from as many Durham neighborhoods as possible as well as residents living outside the city limits.

A light meal is served prior to the start of each class and sessions are held at city and county facilities. There is a $30 fee for residents accepted into the program and a limited number of scholarships are available if needed. Area high school students ages 15 and up, as well as Latino residents, are particularly encouraged to apply.

Interested residents should submit a completed application to the Durham County Clerk to the Board of Commissioners, 200 East Main St., Second Floor, Durham, N.C. 27701.

Interested applicants may also contact the City’s Office of Public Affairs at (919) 560-4123 or the County’s Public Information Office at (919) 560-0000 for information.
