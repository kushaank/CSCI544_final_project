
LANCE Armstrong is missing a testicle. It was surgically removed during his fight against testicular cancer in 1996.

We know that. He knows it too. But the disgraced cyclist’s memory was jolted in a surprising way this week.

Armstrong was playing the popular party game Cards Against Humanity when he picked up a card which read, “Lance Armstrong’s missing testicle”. How awkward.

Cards Against Humanity requires players to match inappropriate questions with even less appropriate answers. Armstrong’s testicle showed up on an answer card. We don’t know what the question was.

Armstrong tackled the potentially clumsy moment with a dose of good, ballsy humour. He seems to be following a new, lighter philosophy these days, encapsulated by the Hunter S Thompson quote he’s embedded in his Twitter profile.

“Life has become immeasurably better since I have been forced to stop taking it seriously,” it reads.

. @Q102Philly @CAH I actually laughed my ass off.

Of course, Armstrong was forced to stop taking life so seriously when he was stripped of his seven Tour de France victories for doping. The threat of legal action is still hanging over him.

In the meantime, he may as well have some fun.
