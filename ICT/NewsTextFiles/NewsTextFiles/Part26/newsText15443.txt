Country manor meets mafia chic in this Lighthouse Hill mansion on Staten Island. From the outside, the stone manse, surrounded by tall trees and winding walkways, looks like it belongs in some far away forest, but on the inside, it's filled with the tackiness all too common in Staten Island mansions. It's certainly toned down compared to this place and this place , but it still has plenty of wooden ornamentation, gaudy velvet drapes, and plump leather furniture. It also has an elevator, private pond, an outdoor kitchen, and several working fireplace. It's listed for $1.695 million.
