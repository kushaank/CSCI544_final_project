DONA ANA COUNTY, N.M.  Dona Ana County Vector Control is offering free Gambusia fish to help curb the mosquito population in Las Cruces and the county.

The fish can eat five times their weight in mosquito larvae each day, officials said. According to Kenneth Scholar, a supervisor for Vector Control, it takes about six to 12 fish in any standing body of water to take out the mosquito population on a half-acre of land.

"It's important to get these fish out into the community during the spring and summer months when they're most effective," Scholar said.

The fish can be picked up from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday at the Dona Ana County minnow pond at 4605 Picacho Ave.

Bags will be offered at the site or residents can bring your own container.
