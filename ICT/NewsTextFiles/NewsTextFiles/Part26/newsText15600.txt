
We're not used to voting in May. A federal judge moved up the July primaries to make sure there's enough time for absentee voting in runoffs. Election officials hope that doesn't hurt voter turnout.

Election workers were busy all day setting up voting booths at the 28 precincts in Dougherty County.  Statewide, about 240,000 voters took advantage of early voting.  That's up slightly from four years ago.  Less than 2,000 of Dougherty County's 50,000 registered voters cast ballots early.  The elections supervisor is hoping for much better turnout tomorrow.

"We would've like to have seen more but hopefully tomorrow is the day that everyone has made up their mind and will turn out to those 28 precincts from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. to make that decision and cast their ballot," said Ginger Nickerson, Dougherty County Elections Supervisor.

Voters should bring current and acceptable picture Identification such as your driver's license, state issued ID or a military ID in order to vote.  If you're not sure who is on the ballot for tomorrow or where you're supposed to vote click here .
