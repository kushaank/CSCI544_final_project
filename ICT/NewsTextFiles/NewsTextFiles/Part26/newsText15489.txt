
The 20th anniversary of the deaths of 41 Cubans trying to cross the Florida Straits is being remembered with a flotilla.

The Miami Democracy Movement plans to announce details Thursday for a July event commemorating the tragedy.

The drownings occurred when a group of about 70 people boarded a stolen tugboat July 13, 1994, in Havana, headed for the United States.

Cuban officials maintain the coast guard vessel accidentally crashed into the tugboat. At least 31 people survived.
