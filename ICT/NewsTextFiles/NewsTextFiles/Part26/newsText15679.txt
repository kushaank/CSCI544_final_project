
The poaching incident occurred sometime between May 12th and 14th.

Responding to the initial report, Fish and Game conservation officer Joey Ishida found the calf shot and left to waste about 25 yards off the Long Gulch Road. There is no open hunting season for elk in the Prairie area during this time of year.

Evidence was collected at the scene, but Ishida hopes to learn more about the case from an eyewitness or others who have knowledge of the poaching incident. “I am very interested in visiting with anyone who has information regarding this poached calf elk,” Ishida stated.
