
Warning: Indian election coverage might induce eye strain.

This week a historic election took place in India. More voters cast ballots than in any other election in human history, electingÂ Narendra Modi as their new prime minister.

What isn't great news for India? Their news. The coverage of the election was so mind-bogglingly fast and complex that it's a miracle the average citizen could follow it at all. John Oliver was happy to point out this and more on Sunday's episode of Last Week Tonight.
