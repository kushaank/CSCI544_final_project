
Telecommunications company Sprint will pay $7.5 million in a record settlement after the Federal Communication Commission said the company failed to honor consumer requests to be spared from unwanted telemarketing calls.

Sprint customers who chose to opt out of sales calls through the company’s own Do-Not-Call registry reportedly continued to receive unwanted calls from telemarketers . The company, which is the third largest wireless carrier in the U.S., said that the issues resulted from “technical and inadvertent human errors,” which were reported to the FCC.

In addition to the settlement, which the FCC said is the largest of its kind to date, Sprint will also have to set up a two-year compliance program aimed to protect consumer privacy and regularly report to regulators.

Sprint previously settled with the U.S. Treasury in 2011 to the tune of $400,000 to resolve an investigation about a similar issue.
