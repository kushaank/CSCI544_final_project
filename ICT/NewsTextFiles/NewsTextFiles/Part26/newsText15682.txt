
Tim and Jen Bowes have three children and adopted three more a few years ago.

“You know, I look at it personally and I see our family tree has changed forever,” Jen said.

Aaiden, Mario and Zia have a safe, loving home thanks to Nebraska Children's Home Society.

“Not only do they put the children first, but they put the families first as well, so we really felt like we were never alone in this process,” Jen said.

A donation to the Children's Home is a gift to thousands of families like the Bowes.

Another organization seeking the support of the community is The Healing Kadi Foundation.

“For a small foundation like ours, it's a tremendous opportunity for people to see our name, to hear our story, our cause,” said Kim Nitchals.

The Healing Kadi Foundation brings medical care to South Sudan.

“The clinic we built is a clinic in a can. It doesn't have in-patient facilities, which is our greatest need at this point and one of the reasons we're excited to do Omaha Gives,” Nitchals said.

Ten dollars could save lives across the globe or help save a child right here in Omaha.

“It's a great cause. There's a lot of kids in the community that need a loving home,” said Tim Bowes.
