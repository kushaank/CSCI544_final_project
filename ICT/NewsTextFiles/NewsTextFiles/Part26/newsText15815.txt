A poll of likely voters released this week by POLITICO shows broad support for comprehensive immigration reform -- even among Republicans.

Researchers found that 64% of GOP respondents said they want comprehensive reform, compared with 78% of Democrats and 71% of independents, six months before the midterm elections.

The POLITICO poll is just the latest in a long line of national surveys that has found overwhelming support for comprehensive immigration reform, though Congress has been able to get nothing done on legislations since the Senate passed its sweeping bill last June.

Predictably, Hispanics and Latinos "strongly support" comprehensive reform, with 85% of those respondents in the POLITICO survey saying it was "important" and 53% saying it was "very important." Hispanics helped carry the Democrats and President Obama to an easy victory in 2012.

Overall, only 12% of those polled said they "strongly oppose" reform. Most of that opposition comes from Republican conservatives and Tea Party members.

The new poll was designed by SocialSphere and conducted by the research firm GFK in Spanish and English as an advance look at November's midterm elections.
