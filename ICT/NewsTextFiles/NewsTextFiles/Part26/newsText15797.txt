
How intensely a person responds to sexual images can be linked his or her number of sexual partners, according to a new study.

Researchers at the University of California of Los Angeles asked 40 male and 22 female subjects how many sex partners they had last year before they showed them 225 images, both sexual and non-sexual.

The researchers analyzed subjects’ ‘late positive potential, which reacts to images depending on their emotional intensity,’ by using an electroencephalogram (EEG), according to a press release. People with more sex partners reacted in the same way when they looked at ‘graphic and less-graphic’ images.

The way to read that is to understand that the people who got damp gussets when looking at pictures of people, whether sexual or not, had more sexual partners. Or, to make it even more simple, the people who were more interested in sex in the first place had more sex.

This makes sex just like anything else desirable: it’s something that one has to work at to get more of. And with booty, at least booty with new and potentially more interesting people, it’s a matter of how many people you ask which will determine how many you get to make the two backed beast with. And this research shows us that those who are, from the start, more interested in the general idea go off and ask more people and thus have more shags.

A Friend of mine,when a lot younger, just used to ask women straight out if they did or didn’t. As he said 9/10 he’d get slapped ..
