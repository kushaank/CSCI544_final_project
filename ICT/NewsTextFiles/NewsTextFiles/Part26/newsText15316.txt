
Two men have been arrested over the death of a reveller at a party in a church hall.

The 24-year-old victim died from multiple stab wounds after violence broke out following the party at the Beaver Centre, run by the Redeemed Christian Church of God in Chadwell Heath, east London.

Police were called to the hall, on an industrial estate, at 5am yesterday following reports of a dispute between two groups of men. The victim, who has not been named, died in hospital two hours later.

Neighbours today said the hall is regularly rented out for private parties on Friday and Saturday nights. It is believed the stabbing took place in a car park at the back of the venue.

Forensic teams were also seen searching a blue Mercedes ML car belonging to factory worker Vasil Ivanov, 28, which was parked in the road when the attack took place.

Mr Ivanov said: “There was a big party. I parked my car there before I went to work that night and when I finished my shift I could see blood on the floor in the alleyway opposite.

Police said they were keeping an “open mind” and refused to rule out the involvement of local gangs in the killing.
