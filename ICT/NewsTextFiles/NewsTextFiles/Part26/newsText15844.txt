
SAN ANTONIO â€” Early voting is underway in the Republican and Democratic primary runoffs and will continue through Friday.

Runoff election day is May 27, but voting early is more convenient.

If you didn't cast a ballot in either primary, you can vote in the runoff of your choice.

If you did vote in the primary, you must stick with the party you chose in the first round.

Traditionally, candidates must labor mightily to get voters to return to the polls for runoff elections, but the results are crucial for setting the government's direction.

A couple of this year's statewide campaigns are particularly nasty, and negative campaigning often inhibits turnout. We urge Texans to vote even if the campaigns are offensive.

Our recommendations for the runoffs are below. Regardless of which candidates you prefer, we urge eligible voters to do their part for democracy and cast a ballot.
