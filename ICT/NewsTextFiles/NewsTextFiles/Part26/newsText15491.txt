INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Dallas Mavericks owner and “Shark Tank” reality star Mark Cuban will serve as the honorary starter of this year’s Indianapolis 500.

The Indianapolis Motor Speedway announced Monday that Cuban will wave the green flag to start the field of 33 drivers at the 98th running of the race on Sunday.

The 55-year-old Cuban is a graduate of Indiana University and has owned the Mavericks since 2000. He joined ABC’s “Shark Tank” in 2010. Cuban says he’s excited to return to Indiana to participate in the race.
