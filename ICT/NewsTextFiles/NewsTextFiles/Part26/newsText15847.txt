
CHENNAI: The  model code of conduct that was in force since the announcement of  Lok Sabha elections on March 5 ceased to be in operation after Chief Election Commissioner V S Sampath presented the list of new MPs to President Pranab Mukherjee on Sunday evening, according to a statement from Tamil Nadu chief electoral officer Praveen Kumar .

The model code of conduct prevented all state governments and the Union government from announcing any new schemes and projects. They could not even inaugurate the completed projects as it was presumed to influence the voters in favour of a particular party. It prevented ministers and other officials connected with the elections from participating in any government function.

After the model code came to force on March 5, allegations flew thick and fast over violation of it and parties complained to the Election Commission about the violations. Chief minister J Jayalalithaa withheld announcement of relief to people killed in natural calamities and other tragedies. She announced relief to the affected people only after a clarification from the CEO.
