
A bandit shot dead by a security guard  outside a Gold Coast tavern was carrying a fake gun.

Police have confirmed the 9mm pistol the 46-year-old robber was  carrying was a replica.

Officers can't confirm if the guard and the dead man were known  to each other.

The Courier Mail reports the guard and the man had previously  worked for the same security firm.

It says the bandit may have used inside knowledge of the  security company's operations to plan the robbery.

Police have said the guard was delivering cash to the Highland  Park Tavern on Monday morning when he was tackled by the man, who  was wearing a motorcycle helmet to hide his identity.

Officers say the guard appeared to have acted instinctively when  he fired several shots.

The robber suffered a number of gunshot wounds and was dead by  the time officers arrived.

Police have interviewed the guard, but no charges have been  laid.

An autopsy will be carried out on the dead man on Tuesday and a  report is being prepared for the coroner.

Police later said they had formally identified the dead man.

They said he was a 46-year-old Coomera man, whose name would not  be released at the request of his family.

The family has asked for privacy. The security guard has also  said he won't be speaking to the media.
