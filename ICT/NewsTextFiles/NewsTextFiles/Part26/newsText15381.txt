Thieves target patrol cars in N. Harris Co.

Authorities are still looking for more people they believe are responsible for stealing gear from two law enforcement vehicles.

Deputies caught one man who broke into their patrol cars and are looking for others over the weekend.

Thieves broke into two patrol cars belonging to the Precinct 4 constable's office on Sky Court near North Bend Drive in north Harris County.

Authorities say they stole weapons and other tactical gear.  Deputy constables managed to catch up to one suspect and recover some of the stolen items.

"This young man had a leg monitoring bracelet on his ankle at that time, which clearly says that he is under some kind of supervision," said Lt. Stan Jolly with the Harris County Precinct 4 Constable's Office.

Investigators say there may be three other people involved with the burglaries.
