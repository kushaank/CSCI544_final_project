A Mississippi man was being held Sunday on $100,000 bond after he snapped a photo at a nursing home of the infirm wife of U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran (R., Miss.) and posted it online without permission, officials said.

In a statement, police in Madison, Miss., said officers arrested Clayton Thomas Kelly, 28 years old, on Friday after he entered St. Catherine's Nursing Home and "illegally and improperly obtained an image of a vulnerable adult resident without their consent for his own benefit."

Mr. Kelly, of Pearl, Miss., was being held at the Madison County Detention Center near Jackson.

Madison police wouldn't confirm Mr. Kelly targeted the 76-year-old senator's wife, Rose. But an attorney for the Cochrans, Donald Clark Jr., said the arrest stems from an unauthorized photo of Mrs. Cochran, who suffers from dementia, that appeared in a video recently posted online. The video, which initially appeared on YouTube, has since been removed.

"That picture was taken inside of Mrs. Cochran's room near her bedside," Mr. Clark, who is chairman of the law firm Butler Snow LLP, said in a statement. "We believed a crime had been committed and we immediately notified the City of Madison Police Department...The police conducted an investigation, still in progress, resulting in [Friday's] arrest."

"As you can imagine, Senator Cochran's first concern was that of the safety of his wife as well as the invasion of her privacy and dignity," Mr. Clark added.

Kevin Camp, an attorney for Mr. Kelly, said his client is cooperating with authorities and denied he had done anything illegal. He said Mr. Kelly wasn't trespassing, adding that he checked himself into the nursing home and took the photo of Mrs. Cochran from a hallway, not her room.

"Maybe it's not in the best taste but he didn't do anything illegal," Mr. Camp said in an interview.

Mr. Camp said his client removed the photo from his blog, called "Constitutional Clayton," where he has written posts critical of Mr. Cochran and praised state Sen. Christopher McDaniel, Mr. Cochran's opponent in a June 3 primary. Mr. Camp said Mr. Kelly also has refused to send the photo to others.

Mr. McDaniel's campaign has denied any involvement in the incident, saying Mr. Kelly was neither a campaign official nor a volunteer.

In a statement posted on his campaign website, Mr. McDaniel said he had reached out to Mr. Cochran to "express my abhorrence for the reprehensible actions of this individual."

"This criminal act is deeply offensive and my team and I categorically reject such appalling behavior," he said. "My thoughts and prayers are with Senator Cochran and his family."

Officials at Mrs. Cochran's nursing home couldn't be reached for comment.
