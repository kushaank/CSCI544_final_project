
DALLAS (CBSDFW.COM) - Southwest Airlines is expected to make a big announcement Monday regarding new destinations and airfares, as the carrier counts down to the end of the Wright Amendment. The restrictions on flights at Dallas Love Field expire in 146 days, on October 13.

The routes expected to be announced have already been found on the company’s website. They include nonstop flights to Denver, Baltimore, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Chicago, Orlando and Washington D.C. beginning on October 13. More nonstop flights to New York City, San Diego, Tampa Bay, Phoenix, Atlanta, Fort Lauderdale, Santa Ana and Nashville begin on November 2.

Travelers can start booking these $79 or $99 flights now.

But some people are wondering if more nonstop flights out of Dallas Love Field will translate to more noise at the airport.

In some respects, that it already the case. Construction of the airport expansion has had an impact on Southwest Airlines planes. Officials stated that jets are more frequently using the runway which goes along Lemmon Avenue because of the construction work being done. That has caused more noise in nearby neighborhoods.

Those involved in preparing for the October end of the Wright Amendment said that it has always been their understanding that there would be no change in the noise levels around Dallas Love Field. But residents argue otherwise, saying that more flights later this year, and bigger planes, will certainly mean more noise.

Southwest Airlines said that its newer planes will be quieter.
