
SINGAPORE — Nearly 20,000 votes and more than 6,500 suggestions later, the Jubilee Baby Gift voting exercise has come to a close with the special medallion/coin voted the most popular gift.

It garnered 61 per cent of the votes, chosen from among 15 items that were short listed for the gift package for babies born next year, said the National Population and Talent Division (NPTD).

A multi-functional shawl trailed the medallion at 47 per cent, followed by a baby sling (44 per cent), a set of baby clothes (42 per cent), a diaper bag (41 per cent) and a scrapbook for baby memories (41 per cent).

The NPTD noted the different approaches people took when choosing the items: Some looked for items that would see the most practical use for parents, while others chose items that would provide historical significance when the baby grew up and looked at the gift some twenty years from now.

The Jubilee Baby Gift is a community initiative led by the NPTD as part of the nation’s celebrations to commemorate 50 years of Independence.

The final list of items that will make up the gift package will be announced later this year.
