
Credit Suisse Group AG will plead guilty to a single charge of conspiring to aid tax evasion, as part of a landmark tax-evasion settlement with U.S. authorities.

• UBS : In early 2009, Credit Suisse rival UBS AG reached a deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department, admitting it had helped American clients evade taxes. Switzerland’s largest bank, which had been recently gotten a $60 billion bailout from the Swiss government after racking up huge losses in the mortgage meltdown, also agreed to pay $780 million to settle its tax case.

As part of the settlement, the Swiss government allowed UBS to hand over names of account holders to U.S. authorities, helping to pry open the world Swiss private banking that had been protected by the country’s banking secrecy laws.

• Wegelin & Co.: Wegelin & Co. became the first foreign bank to receive a criminal sentence for tax violations in January 2013, when the Swiss lender pleaded guilty to conspiring to help Americans evade taxes.

The bank, Switzerland’s oldest at the time, admitted that it willfully ignored tax evasion allegedly committed by its American customers. The bank said it was simply following Swiss banking privacy laws and thought it would be protected from prosecution by U.S. law enforcement because it didn’t have a physical presence in the U.S.

The guilty plea, which came with $74 million in fines and forfeits, came as the bank, weakened by its tussle with the U.S., was in the process of winding down. Parts of the bank that were untainted by the tax problems were sold and are now operating as Notenstein Private Bank.

• Bank Frey: Bank Frey & Co. AG, a boutique lender with an office on Zurich’s toniest street, said in October 2013 it was closing its doors in part because of its “tax dispute with the USA.” The bank is one of about a dozen being investigated by the Justice Department for helping Americans evade taxes.

The decision to cease operations followed an indictment of Frey’s head of private banking, who was accused of helping Americans avoid their obligations. An outside attorney, who later pleaded guilty, was also indicted.

Bank Frey is in the process of winding down its operations.
