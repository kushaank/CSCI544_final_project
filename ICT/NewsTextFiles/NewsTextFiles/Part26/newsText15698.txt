
DERRY — At a cost of approximately $3 million, Parkland Medical Center broke ground Thursday on an Emotional & Behavioral Wellness Unit.The project will include a new 7,500-square-foot, two-story addition and 2,600 square feet of renovation, the medical center said in a news release.

The 14-bed facility is slated to deliver inpatient behavioral health care for individuals with acute emotional health stressors and symptoms that cannot be safely and adequately addressed on an outpatient basis, the release said.

The assessment, planning, delivery and evaluation of patient care and safety will be performed by a therapeutic team consisting of physicians, nurses, social workers, and staff focused on case management, activity therapy, education, and clinical nutrition.“Emotional wellness is an essential part of a person’s overall health and well-being,” said Parkland CEO Chris Accashian. “We are proud to offer this new program, which will provide more patients with comprehensive, individualized care when they need it most, without leaving their community.”The patient’s treatment plan will include active psychiatric treatment, medication administration and monitoring, an after-care plan, development of family and individual support systems, medication management strategies for ongoing care — and where appropriate — ongoing interaction with personal care.
