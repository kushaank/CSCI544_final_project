
There was confusion in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, on Monday over the discovery of  a decapitated corpse found on a rail line.

The lifeless body of the youngman was  reportedly found on the rail line near Isaac Mowo Street, opposite the office of the Nigerian Bottling Company.

Our correspondent gathered that some people, who discovered the lifeless body early on Monday fled as they were reportedly horrified by  such gory sight.

It was learnt  that some parts of the deceased, such as the head, a hand and a leg were found at different spots near the rail line.

The cause of the death of the man, whose identity could not be ascertained as of the time of filling this report, was a subject of controversy as people gave different accounts.

A source claimed that the man was crushed on Sunday by a Kano-bound train, which had a stop-over in Ilorin.

Another source also claimed that the man jumped onto an oncoming train in an apparent suicide attempt and was consequently crushed.

A different account said the victim might have been killed by unknown assailant and his corpse dragged onto the rail line.

The Police Public Relations Officer, Kwara State Command, Mr. Okasanmi Ajayi, in a telephone interview with our correspondent on Monday said the police gathered that the victim was crushed by a moving train.

But the Railway District Manager for West, Nigeria Railway Corporation, Mr. Rasheed Gbadamosi, in a telephone interview with our correspondent said the dead man was not killed by a train.
