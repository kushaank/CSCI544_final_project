TIGARD, Ore. (KOIN 6) — In March, Tigard voters passed a ballot initiative requiring public approval before any light rail or bus project can pass through.

In 1977, Tigard had 14,000 people. Now it’s a city of 49,000, said former Tigard Mayor Craig Dirksen.

Plans to bring mass transit to the area have been met with opposition, and now Tualatin may follow Tigard’s lead.

Tualatin citizens are gathering signatures requiring any approval of a plan be put before voters.

Metro, though, is moving forward with plans for a new high capacity transit line from Southwest Portland through Tigard to Tualatin.

The Southwest Corridor plan is still being whittled down by Metro and the community. No route is yet set.

But one route strongly being suggested is from Barber Boulevard in Portland to the Tigard Triangle on 72nd, through downtown Tigard and south into Tualatin.

It would serve Bridgeport Village.

Dirksen, who is now on the Metro Council, said there are some people who are opposed to any plan.

“But then there is a larger group of people who say this is a huge undertaking that would be very impactful of our community and so we want to have a direct say in what happens,” he said.

Once a draft plan is approved, he said, it would be showed to voters for their voice to be heard.

If enough signatures are gathered to have voters sign off on any plan for the city, a vote in Tualatin could happen in September.
