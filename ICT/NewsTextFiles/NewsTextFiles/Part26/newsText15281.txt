
DYFED-POWYS Police have introduced new powers to help better protect victims of domestic abuse.

Domestic Violence Protection Notices and Orders are new powers that allow the police to provide immediate emergency protection by intervening in cases where police believe a victim may be at risk from violence or are worried about violent behaviour within a household, but do not have enough evidence to bring a criminal charge.

These notices are issued by senior police officers and can place certain prohibitions and restrictions upon offenders to safeguard victims.

Detective Inspector Neil Jenkins, of Dyfed-Powys Police Public Protection Unit, said: "The Protection Notices and Orders will allow us to put in place protection for the victim in the immediate aftermath of a domestic violence incident. They give victims of domestic abuse the time, space and support to plan a safer future, by keeping the perpetrator away.

“These powers can bridge the gap in providing immediate emergency protection to the victim where there is an on-going risk of violence."

If someone breaches a notice they will be subject to immediate arrest and can then be remanded in custody to appear before a court for a full order to be considered. A breach of an order can lead to a maximum fine of £5,000 or a two-month prison sentence.
