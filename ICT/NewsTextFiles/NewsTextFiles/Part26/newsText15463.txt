
North Miami Mayor Marie Lucie Tondreau was among four people indicted in a mortgage fraud scheme.

The charges filed on Monday by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida stem from activities from December 2005 to May 2008 - well before Tondreauâ€™s election in June 2013 as the city's first Haitian-American female mayor. Tondreau, Miramar resident Karl Oreste , Lauderdale Lakes resident Okechukwu Josiah Odunna and North Miami resident Kelly Augustin were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud.

Tondreau will most likely be suspended from office by Gov. Rick Scott . Even worse, each defendant could face up to 30 years in prison if convicted.

That makes four mayors in Miami-Dade County to face criminal charges in the past nine months.

The feds accuse the four of obtaining $8 million in fraudulent loans on 20 properties that resulted in losses to banks. Oreste, president of North Miami Beach-based KMC Mortgage Corp., advertised his companyâ€™s services on Tondreauâ€™s radio show and, when listeners responded, they were recruited to pose as borrowers in the purchase of local properties. Augustin, a KMC employee, also recruited straw borrowers, according to the indictment.

Odunna, an attorney who headed a title company, helped Oreste prepare loan applications that contained false employment, wage and financial information about the straw borrowers, according to the indictment. In some cases, the purchase prices of the properties were grossly inflated and the lenders were told that the straw borrowers made down payments when, in fact, no such payments were made, the indictment says.
