The Swedish Foreign Ministry cut whistle blower Edward Snowden from a list of suggested participants for a Stockholm forum on internet freedom and openness.

German online magazine Cicero writes that Snowden, a former U.S. government contractor who revealed details on massive American intelligence-gathering programs, was on the list of potential invitees to the third annual Stockholm Internet Forum.

The list was drawn up by the foundation .SE which manages the Swedish URL suffix. Cicero writes that Snowden as well as journalist Glenn Greenwald, who has written about a number of documents provided by Snowden, were on the list.

But Olof Ehrenkrona, ambassador at the Foreign Ministry, wrote on Twitter that Snowden was not invited since the main focus of this year's conference is on developing countries and that the Ministry sought to have a balance of different backgrounds, cultures and opinions among attendees.

"Not a boycott," Ehrenkrona wrote. "We just did not invite him. Others not invited are not boycotted."

Pirate Party MEP Christian Engstr√∂m condemned the move calling it, in a press release, a "scandal that the government is stopping NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden from participating in the Stockholm Internet Forum."

The forum is organized by the Ministry, Sida and .SE and hosts policymakers, activists and businesses to discuss how online openness can promote global economic and social development.

.SE declined to comment on the selection process and added, on Twitter, that it was "happy" with the program and the list of participants for this year's forum.
