ROUTE 66: Gavin Hillier.

A POPULAR motorcycle route could become a death trap unless its condition is addressed, according to an Orange motorcyclist.

Gavin Hillier, a community representative on the Orange-Cabonne Road Safety Committee, has voiced his concern for the condition of Icely, White Rock and Ophir roads, saying washout from driveways could be dangerous for motorcyclists.

Mr Hillier said dirt and gravel from farm gates and road shoulders washed onto the road after rainfall.

“I last rode on it two months ago and there were six patches of that,” he said.

“The issue is you’ve got less surface contact because you’ve only got two tyres.

Mr Hillier said the roads had become popular with motorcyclists as a scenic route to Bathurst in the past two years.

“We have seen Bathurst council has done a lot of work, but it still seems an issue on the Cabonne side,” he said.

A journey in his car on the weekend revealed fewer danger spots, but Mr Hillier said there had been no recent rain.

Mr Hillier said Cabonne Council staff informed him they would investigate, however a council spokesman said no correspondence had been received and encouraged Mr Hillier to contact council.
