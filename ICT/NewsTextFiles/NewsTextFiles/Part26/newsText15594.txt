As many Ontario residents relaxed this Victoria Day weekend, politicians were hard at work on the campaign trail.

1. If elected, the New Democrats promise $60 million annually would help protect schools on the chopping block in the province, said NDP Leader Andrea Horwath onÂ Saturday.

The annual funding would help maintain and renovate schools so they could continue to operate, while allowing non-profit and community groups to take advantage of unused space, said Horwath.

PC Deputy Leader Christine Elliott questioned the feasibility of the plan.

2. Meanwhile, the Liberals ridiculed the NDP leaderâs expense reports, whichÂ included muffins, taxi rides and a $0.25 parking fee.

âIn another blow to her credibility, Andrea Horwath has been caught billing taxpayers for thousands of dollars in personal expenses all while pretending that she didnât,â the Liberals said in a release Saturday.

Horwath defended her actions, saying she spends a lot of time travelling and has no choice to expense items she normally wouldnât.

3. PC Leader Tim Hudak joinedÂ HorwathÂ in callingÂ for a judicial inquiry into the controversial cancellation of two Toronto-area gas plants.

But the Liberals say Hudak has a âreckless agenda,â which includes new powers for the Minister of Energy and/or municipalities to cancel projects and retroactively revoke approvals, and will cost the province up to $20 billion.

4. Ontario PCs released a new ad online Saturday with a message of hope.

Hudak took a jab against the Liberals and their negative approach.

âIn this campaign youâll see a PC party not saying whatâs wrong with the other guys, whatâs wrong with their party â weâre going to be talking about whatâs right with our plan, our vision for Ontario,â said Hudak.

Ontario Liberal Party Leader Kathleen Wynne denied thatÂ sheâs running a negative campaign.

Voters head to the polls June 12.
