
The days are longer, warmer and brighter. This is the time of year when turtles, snakes, frogs and salamanders are on the move – and are at the most risk for mortality on roadways.

In New Hampshire, we have seven species of turtles, of which almost half are considered rare or endangered.

Many of our eleven snake species are in a continued trend of decline across the state. Although various factors contribute to these declines, the bottom line is that all too often these animals can’t successfully make it across roadways.

But you can help change this!

From mid-May to the end of June, these creatures are moving more often to find mates, lay eggs and utilize different wetlands. As a resident of the southeast part of the state – which is a hot spot for both road density and many of these species – I ask that my fellow drivers please make an effort to be extra aware when driving these next few months.

Scan roadways particularly on wet or humid nights, or when you’re driving by water. When possible, help move reptiles across the road in the same direction they were heading. Share this with your neighbors and friends.

You can become familiar with the different New Hampshire species on the Fish and Game website, and remember that New Hampshire Fish and Game’s Nongame Department welcomes reports of anything you see crossing the road. Help save a population this summer – brake for turtles!
