Family and friends of a man who was beaten to death in the East Village held a vigil in his memory Monday.

Sixty-eight-year-old Wen-hui Ruan was walking along East 6th Street earlier this month when he was attacked.

His assailant threw him against a wall then punched and kicked him in the head before fleeing the scene.

Those at the vigil say they hope that this can be a catalyst for addressing violent crime issues in the city.

"We know that violence has been rampant in this city and this particularly was very senseless act of violence," said City Councilwoman Rosie Mendez.

"This is a community that brings everyone together, and we need to start really addressing the issue of violence," said another attendee.

Jamie Pugh, 20, has been arrested in connection with the attack, and faces second degree murder, robbery and assault charges.
