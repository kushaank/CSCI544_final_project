AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) - A national anti-gay marriage group that helped defeat a same-sex marriage law in 2009 in Maine could face more than $50,000 in fines for violating campaign finance laws.

The Maine Ethics Commission said Monday its investigators have found that should be fined for failing for register as a ballot question committee and filing campaign finance reports.

NOM was the primary donor when it gave nearly $2 million to Stand for Marriage Maine, a political action committee, to help defeat the Maine law in a 2009 referendum. Gay marriage became legal in the state after a second referendum in 2012.

State law requires groups to register as ballot question committees if they raise or spend more than $5,000 to influence a state ballot question.
