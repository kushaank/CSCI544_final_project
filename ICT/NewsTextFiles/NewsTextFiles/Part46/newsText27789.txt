
LAS VEGAS, Nev. — Nine dogs, who had been caged their entire lives in a laboratory in Nevada, have recently taste freedom for the first time in their entire lives, and the moment was all caught on video.

An online video has surfaced and gone viral, and the organization who posted it is happy people are taking notice. The Beagle Freedom Project , whose mission is to rescue and find homes for beagles used in laboratory research, rescued the nine beagles deemed the “Lucky 9” from a Las Vegas lab where the canines were used in animal testing.

The nine dogs have finally been assigned real names after only having numbers to identify them, and thanks to their rescuers, got to experience grass, sunlight and fresh air for the first time ever in their lives. Originally no one was sure how the animals would react after being inside for so long, but it seems the dogs instinctively knew what to do.

I’d like to have a hands on experience with the owners of the laboratory, and the companies whose products were tested on these dogs.

But, it’s okay to eat cows and chickens and pigs and treat them worse than this.
