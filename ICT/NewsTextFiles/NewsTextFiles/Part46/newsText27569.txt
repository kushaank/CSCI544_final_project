
It should be no surprise that California Chrome is the favorite for the Belmont Stakes 2014  which will take place on June 7, 2014.

The Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes champion has been given approval to wear a nasal strip for the upcoming horse racing competition. The New York Racing Association gave trainer Art Sherman the approval after checking with the New York State Gaming Commission.

California Chrome wore a nasal strip for the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes. There is no known racing advantage to wearing the device but it could help the horse breathe better.

Sherman’s horse is in line to become the first horse since 1978 to win the Triple Crown. However, history is against California Chrome winning the Belmont Stakes 2014 as the last 12 horses to win the first two legs of the Triple Crown have failed at the final hurdle.
