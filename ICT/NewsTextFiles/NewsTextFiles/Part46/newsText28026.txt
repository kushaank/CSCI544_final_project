
â€œEven though this is clearly a big change in Oregon and for Oregon families, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s going to have a big impact on the administration of employee benefits,â€� said Sarah Friend , an employee benefits consultant with Portland-based consulting firm The Partners Group.

The big change, she said, came last year when the IRS issued guidance regarding the U.S. Supreme Courtâ€™s decision to strike down the federal Defense of Marriage Act as unconstitutional. That ruling upheld same-sex marriage in states where they are legal and cleared the way for those couples to receive federal benefits available to opposite-sex couples.

The Oregon Department of Justice last fall said state agencies should extend benefits to same-sex couples who were legally married outside of Oregon.

The state Department of Revenue said if a same-sex couple was legally married out of state, it would mirror the IRS and recognize the marriage for purposes of state income taxes.

If a same-sex couple is married today, the spouse can be added to a plan without having to wait for the next open enrollment period. Some may have been holding off until the ruling.

For those who choose to remain domestic partners, nothing changes, Friend said. Benefits plans commonly cover same-sex domestic partners, whether theyâ€™ve been required to or not. But those partners now may want to tie the knot in order to receive the benefits tax free.

Regena Frieden , a spokeswoman for Cambia Health Solutions, said today's ruling is "a significant milestone and further allows our health plan companies the ability to recognize same-sex spouses for health care coverage according to law. In practice, this is something weâ€™ve already extended to many of our clients as an option for their coverage needs."
