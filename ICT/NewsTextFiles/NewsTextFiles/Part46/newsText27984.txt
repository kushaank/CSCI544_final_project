
California Chrome and jockey Victor Espinoza cross the finish line as the winners of the 140th Kentucky Derby.

The trainer for California Chrome, winner of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes this year, threatened to keep the horse out of the Belmont Stakes if he couldn't use nasal strips, according to a report by CNN.

The 3-year-old horse wore them across his nose to help with breathing while winning the first two legs of horse racing's Triple Crown. California trainer Doug O'Neill told the Associated Press that two years ago, New York racing officials said his horse, I'll Have Another, couldn't wear a nasal strip in the Belmont.

Officials with the New York State Gaming Commission said a decision on whether to allow the strips this year would be left to the state's racing association. That decision came this morning, and California Chrome will be allowed to use the strips if his trainer chooses, according to a report by ESPN.

The Belmont is scheduled for June 7, in Elmont, NY. It is generally considered the most difficult race of the Triple Crown because of its long 1.5-mile dirt track.
