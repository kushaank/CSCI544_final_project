
A woman held in the Sullivan County jail has died after being found unconscious early Sunday morning.

According to a press release from the Sullivan County Sheriff's Office, no foul play is suspected and the inmate death appears to be the result of natural causes. The body of Lisa Ann Velasquez, 39, has been sent for an autopsy.

Just after 4 a.m. Sunday, Velasquez was observed to be unconscious, with medical staff at the jail in Blountville immediately administering CPR. She was then transported to Bristol Regional Medical Center by EMS and later pronounced dead.

Velasquez had been held in the Sullivan County Correctional Facility since May 2, when she was arrested and charged with willful abuse, neglect or exploitation of adults, along with theft of less than $500.

In January, Velasquez was indicted by a Sullivan County grand jury, according to Sullivan County Assistant District Attorney Amy Hinkle, with the alleged incidents occurring in Bristol, Tenn.
