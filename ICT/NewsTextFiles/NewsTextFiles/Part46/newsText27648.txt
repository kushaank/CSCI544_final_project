CAPE ELIZABETH, Maine (NEWS CENTER) -- The Maine Food Strategy is releasing its findings on Mainers preferences toward local food Monday based off the 2014 Consumer Survey Report.

The report will detail the purchasing habits of the 600 Mainers who were surveyed. The questions had a focus on local food, asking participants to define local and what percentage of their grocery bill is locally produced food.

The Maine Food Strategy's goal is to create a network of organizations, agencies, businesses and individuals contributing to the food system in Maine. It aims to discuss and discover if the New England states could be self-sufficient with food by 2060. The group said interest in local food is at an all time high. Maine has many local farmer's markets and Portland has a Buy Local network.

The group will release the findings at Jordan's Farm in Cape Elizabeth at 10 a.m.
