
MARYLAND HEIGHTS, MO (KPLR) –When Deborah Weinstein lost her son to a drunk driver in 2011, she was looking for a way to honor his memory.  She thought a walk would be a good idea.  That’s when she discovered there were no walks honoring victims of alcohol related crashes in Missouri.

Her next step was to help launch the 1st ever “ Walk Like MADD ” in 2013.

“I wanted to participate. I really didn’t want to start one,” said Weinstein.

Sunday was the 2nd annual “ Walk Like MADD ”.  Families and friends of victims walked around Creve Coeur   Lake honoring the memory of those killed by drivers who were drunk.

Weinstein held back tears as she talked about how much the even means.

“I never thought this would start something so big,” said Weinstein.

She said victims groups across the state of Missouri have contacted her for help.

“I guess they’ve seen ours and want to be involved also,” said Weinstein.

Susan Cliffe wore a t-shirt with her son’s photo on the back.  She said Derek Cliffe was killed by a drunk driver in February.

“He was very young.  He was 26 and had no opportunity to be a father or a grandfather,” said an emotional Cliffe.

She hopes public displays such as Sunday’s walk will raise awareness about how serious the problem of drinking and driving is.
