
The owners of the Sixth Street Grill in Eugene have filed a $25,000 lawsuit against an unknown person who they say posted a false advertisement on the craigslist website purporting to be seeking a line cook for the restaurant.

Grill owners Keith and Linda Addison said in the lawsuit that around April 8 they posted a legitimate job listing on craigslist for a line cook.

But about one day later, someone else posted a job listing on craigslist for a line cook at the restaurant. Instead of a job listing, however, the post warned “Do Not Work For These People,” the suit alleges.

The fake job listing also falsely stated that the Addisons are greedy, incompetent, unknowledgeable about how to operate a restaurant, treat their employees poorly and unfairly, and fail to comply with wage and hour laws, the suit says.

The lawsuit, filed in Lane County Circuit Court, notes that the defamatory statements were published on the Internet through craigslist and were able to be seen by anyone seeking employment opportunities in Eugene.

The lawsuit says the Addisons are entitled to damages of up to $25,000 for injury to business reputation, and for embarrassment and humiliation caused by the defamatory statements.

The suit identifies the defendant as Unknown Doe.
