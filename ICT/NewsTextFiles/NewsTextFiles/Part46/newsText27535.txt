
Baker University Minister Ira DeSpain served his alma mater for 22 years and has been a minister for 40. DeSpain has officiated more than 300 weddings at Baker and added several more on Saturday.

To commemorate DeSpain's retirement at the end of June, Baker alumni who met their spouses at the school renewed their vows in the backyard of the chapel.

"When my wife and I were married for 40 years several years ago we renewed our own vows, and it was very meaningful at the time," DeSpain said.

Baldwin City residents Carolyn and Rick Woodhead were one of more than 30 couples who renewed their vows at Osborne Chapel on Saturday at Baker University.

"We met at Mulvane Hall my freshman year and we got married in 1984, so this is the year of our 30th anniversary," Rick Woodhead said.

The Woodhead's didn't get married at the chapel because it wasn't built yet, but welcomed the opportunity to celebrate their marriage with their children since they weren't there the first time.

"I just think it's very special that even after all this time, we still love each other very much and we want to do it all over again," Carolyn Woodhead said.

DeSpain decided he would retire this year back in 2008. He made the announcement a year ago, before making his last official public address this morning at Baker's baccalaureate before graduation.

"It's been a great run. I've loved every minute of it and learned a lot," DeSpain said. "It's just great to remember the people that have been so impactful in my life and that I've helped when they were here."
