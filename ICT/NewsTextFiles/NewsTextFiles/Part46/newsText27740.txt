
"Eight Is Enough" - Molly gets accepted into an elite eight-week writer's workshop in Iowa but faces a big decision when Mike asks her not to go, on the fourth season finale of MIKE & MOLLY, tonight, May 19 (9:00-9:30 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network.

MIKE & MOLLY stars Billy Gardell and Melissa McCarthy in a comedy about a working-class Chicago couple who had almost given up on love...and then found each other. Officer Mike Biggs is a good-hearted cop who works the beat with his fast-talking, wise guy partner, Officer Carl McMillan. When he least expected it, Mike met Molly Flynn, an instantly likeable fourth grade teacher with whom he's immediately smitten. Molly lives with her sexy older sister, Victoria, and their flirtatious, wine-loving mother, Joyce. Mike and Carl frequent a diner where they've become friends with Senegalese waiter, Samuel. Mike's other friend is Harry, his Overeater's Anonymous partner who he met at a Cubs game. Often, Mike and Molly's relationship is complicated by interference from his mom, Peggy, and Carl's Grandma and Joyce's fianc√©, Vince, who offer unsolicited advice on love. However, now that they've found each other and are married, Mike and Molly look forward to the next chapter of their lives together.
