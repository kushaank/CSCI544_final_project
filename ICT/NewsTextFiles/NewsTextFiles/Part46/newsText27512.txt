Brandon  Volunteer members of the Rutland Area Prevention Coalition are coordinating the 2014 Sticker Shock campaign which encourages area youth and their families to celebrate upcoming school prom- and graduation-related events safely and without alcohol.

Last week, the Coalition partnered with Sgt.  J.J. Bixby of the Rutland County Sheriff’s Department, West Rutland School youth, and two area Retailers to promote the Sticker Shock campaign.

The group also partnered with Brandon Special Police Officer Anne Bandy, Otter Valley Union High School students, and two Brandon area retailers, to promote awareness that providing alcoholic beverages to minors is a criminal offense punishable by fines and possibly jail time.

Bright orange stickers with information were placed on alcohol-related products in participating local stores in an effort to deter youth and adults from engaging in rowdy activity.

According to Allison Iannetti, the RAP Coalition’s tobacco prevention and youth coordinator, RAP Coalition members thanked the Stewart’s and Jiffy Mart  stores located in West Rutland, as well as the Champlain Farms store and Vermont Liquor Outlet located in Brandon  for being part of the event.
