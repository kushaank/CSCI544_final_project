
Â This year AAA is expecting the highest Memorial Day travel since the recession began in 2007.

With an improving economy and more families wanting to get out of town after a long and harsh winter, AAA says the travel volume in Ohio compared to last year is expected to increase.

"We're asking people if they're road trip ready," said Kimberly Schwind, AAA spokesperson. "Make sure that you are ready for that summer road trip. Whether it's getting your maps and tour books, planning your destination, getting deals on hotels, or even getting your vehicle ready."

The auto club also says about 1.3  million Ohioans will travel at least 50 miles from home over the long memorial day weekend.

"We see people going up to Put-in Bay, Cedar Point, Columbus to visit the Zoo and Zoombezi Bay, the Wilds is very popular and also Amish country. So we see a lot of people taking trips local more close to home here in Ohio," said Schwind.

About 90 percent of Ohioans traveling -- or about 1.2 million -- are expected to drive to their destinations. AAA expects over 36 million Americans nation wide to travel this Thursday through Monday.
