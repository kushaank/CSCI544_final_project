For one couple at the Multnomah County Building on Monday, the gay marriage ruling was a celebration of a moment in history, as well as a life recently ended.

Jacqueline and Paul Zapp-Albin stood in the building's lobby at noon, passing out flower bouquets to couples who streamed through the doors to get marriage licenses following Judge Michael McShane's decision to strike down Oregon's gay marriage ban.

The flowers, Paul Zapp-Albin said, came from his father's funeral just days earlier. Marriage equality was an important issue to his father.

"He would have wanted to be a part of this," he said.

"They're for whoever needs them," Jacqueline Zapp-Albin said. "We just decided to come down."

The pair, who brought their 3-month-old son, said they felt compelled to support the 23 couples who, as of 1 p.m., had obtained marriage licenses in Multnomah County.

Only last year, the Zapp-Albins took their vows.

"We got to come down here to get our license last year, and that was a happy day," Jacqueline Zapp-Albin said. "We wanted to join in someone else's wedding party."

They joined a crowd of gay rights advocates, county officials and others who crowded into the county building's lobby Monday to cheer the historic decision.

Passing cars honked and, when the news broke about McShane's decision, someone hollered "equality!" into the crowd. A gleeful outburst of cheers and clapping followed.
