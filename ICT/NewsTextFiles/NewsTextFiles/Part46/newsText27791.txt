
DES MOINES_ There is a Top 10 list for just about everything. State Treasurer Michael L. Fitzgerald has a Top 10 list of his own, the Top 10 unclaimed properties. "We are locally listing the largest 10 unclaimed properties available for claim in Tama County," Fitzgerald said. "I encourage all Iowans to check their local newspaper for the Great Iowa Treasure Hunt list that will be published soon. Individuals can also check online at greatiowatreasurehunt.com."

The list of the Top 10 properties in Tama County is being released in conjunction with the upcoming spring publication of the Great Iowa Treasure Hunt. It includes thousands of names of individuals with unclaimed property that have been received in the last year. "People believe they would never lose track of their assets, but it happens all the time," said Fitzgerald. "My office makes it easy for you to find and claim what is rightfully yours."

The Great Iowa Treasure Hunt program has returned over $175 million in unclaimed property to more than 423,000 people since Fitzgerald created it in 1983. Unclaimed property refers to money and other assets held by financial institutions or companies that have lost contact with the property's owner for a specific period of time. State law requires these institutions and companies to annually report unclaimed property to the state treasurer's office. The assets are then held until the owner or heir of the property is found.
