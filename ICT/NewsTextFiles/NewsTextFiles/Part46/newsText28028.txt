
Update at 7:28 a.m.: Northbound Central Expressway has reopened.

Original item posted at 6:18 a.m.: Two big rigs crashed on northbound Central Expressway at Ridgemont Drive early this morning, closing the highway near the Plano-Allen border.

Officials say they donâ€™t know how long Central will be closed. The reason: The 18-wheelers were carrying fuel, and it appears the accident resulted in a fuel spill. There are, however, no reported injuries from the accident, which is causing traffic to exit at Legacy Drive.
