
Medics at the Fresno ER eventually got the truth about the mysterious object they were seeing on X-rays. The sex toy 'got lost' inside him when he and his wife got a little too adventurous .

A California man who told doctors he was constipated was found to have a running vibrator stuck inside his large intestine.

The red-faced patient unsurprisingly failed to tell medics the whole story when he showed up at ER in Fresno.

But an X-ray soon revealed that a sex game with his wife had got wildly out of hand.

"We could see, perfectly, a large object that was lodged in the large intestine," nurse Stevey Pope, who treated the man, told TLC's Sex Sent Me To The ER show.

"This is the first time I've encountered a running vibrator still inside somebody," he said, revealing that the sex toy had "got lost" inside him.

In TLC's reconstruction of the incident, medics at a Fresno, Calif., ER found a mysterious object lodged in a patient's large intestine.

The running vibrator had slowly worked its way into the man's digesitve system.

Nurse Stevey Pope says the man could have suffered a variety of unpleasant problems as result of the sexual adventure gone wrong.

The man's uncomfortable story will be featured on an upcoming episode of TLC's 'Sex Sent Me to the E.'

Had they not removed the gadget, Pope added, then the man could have suffered serious injuries.

"It could lead to internal bleeding [and] infection, and major abdominal surgery, colostomy bags and feeding tubes," he claimed.

The incident, a reconstruction of which was aired on Saturday's show, follows last week's revelation that a woman was hospitalized putting exploding candy into her genitals during sex.
