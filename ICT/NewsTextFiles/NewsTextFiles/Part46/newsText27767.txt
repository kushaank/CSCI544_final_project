From the time it leaves Lake Arlington until the time it reaches customers’ taps, Arlington’s water treatment team is busy trying to make their H20 as clean and tasty as possible.

And if their growing display case of trophies is any indication, they’re getting the job done.

“We take really great pride in the water that we produce for the citizens of Arlington,” said Bill Gase, water treatment manager for the City of Arlington.

First, they pre-treat the water, then mix it with chemicals that cause all the gunk in it to solidify. That goop is then filtered out of the water.

Gase said the next step is unique to Arlington and the real secret to their success.

“We apply ozone in two different locations to help combat any taste and odor compounds that may be in the water,” said Gase.

After that, the water is filtered one last time, then it’s finally sent out to homes in Arlington.

Although their water has earned them quite a reputation, Gase said he and his team are still thirsty and looking for ways to improve.

“It pushes us to keep doing better and to keep staying on top,” said Gase.

Now, they move on to the state competition and with any luck the national one.
