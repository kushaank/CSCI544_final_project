
LONG BEACH — The Mississippi Department of Marine Resources will hold a public meeting Thursday on how the state should spend $10.9 million it received for damage to oyster and blue crab fisheries.

The hearing, from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at Long Beach’s St. Thomas the Apostle Catholic Church, is meant to let commercially licensed crabbers and oystermen comment on spending.

The money is compensation for a pulse of fresh water released into the Mississippi Sound when Louisiana’s Bonnet Carre Spillway opened in 2011 to relieve Mississippi River flooding.

It could be used to restore crab and oyster habitat or assist fishermen.

Fishermen can comment at the meeting or mail comments no later than May 30 to: Department of Marine Resources, attn. Joe Jewell, 1141 Bayview Ave., Biloxi, MS 39530.
