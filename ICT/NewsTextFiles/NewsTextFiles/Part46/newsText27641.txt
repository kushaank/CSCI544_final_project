MOSS POINT, Mississippi -- The Magnolia Chapter of Federally Employed Women donated 15 Mother's Day gift bags to Abundant Grace Emergency Shelter to bring joy to homeless mothers on the celebrated day.

Shelia Webster and Lametrice S. Sims, members of the Magnolia Chapter of Few brought the gifts as an expression of love and support for women experiencing personal hardship.

Located in Moss Point, the shelter serves women and children who are experiencing hardship and are in need of a place to sleep while striving to regain self-sufficiency.

"This is so sweet of them," says shelter volunteer, Esther Swenson, "It is wonderful to know that all mothers are remembered and thought of on this day. The women we serve will love this."

Melita Jones, Executive Director of The Trinity Outreach Corporation, Inc. was thrilled to receive the donation, "This donation is such a blessing to the women that receive shelter services at Abundant Grace Emergency Shelter. Mother's Day is a special time for all mothers, regardless of their current circumstance.
