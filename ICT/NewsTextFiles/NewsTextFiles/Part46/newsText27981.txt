
COOS BAY, Ore. - Citizens Against LNG gathered outside Pony Village Mall Saturday protesting the proposed Jordan Cove liquified natural gas terminal .

The organization filed an appeal last week against the project.

Some protesters said the plant may solve  short-term unemployment problems but cause problems in the future.

"I don't think this is going to help our kids," said Rick Staggenborg. "I think this is going to destroy our kids' future because of a global economy change and because of what it's doing to the water."

The group plans to protest again this week in Coos Bay.

He does not want good paying jobs in his community, but he will take the welfare the state provides. What a bunch of idiots.

@flor3nc3 Â yes, he says "I think"", then "I don't think"

I took this photo about 10 AM, but since it was in the shade of one of our trees, I decided to use the flash and it made it look more like I had taken it at night.

While plucking dead blossoms from my Petunia plant I noticed this unusual spider so decided to take a photo of it. After loaded the shot in my computer I saw that the design on it's back looked like some sort of 'space alien'. Interesting. Enjoy.

Saw smoke from a lightening strike in the hills above our place.  Flew my RC plane with camera to check out the smoke.  At the same time we alerted the fire department and explained we had a drone checking out the situation.
