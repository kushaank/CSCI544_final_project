ERIE, Pa. — A North Carolina man faces sentencing before a federal judge on charges he embezzled more than $422,000 from a northwestern Pennsylvania animal shelter and one of his private clients.

Forty-nine-year-old Richard Danz uprooted his family from Elk County, Pennsylvania, to Matthews, North Carolina, days after FBI agents searched his St. Marys in August 2012. St. Marys is about 100 miles northeast of Pittsburgh.

Danz pleaded guilty in April 2013 to stealing money from the Elk County Humane Society in St. Marys, where he volunteered as accountant and treasurer until June 2012. He then stole money from a private accounting client to cover up the shelter thefts.

Danz was scheduled to be sentenced Monday afternoon by a federal judge in Erie.
