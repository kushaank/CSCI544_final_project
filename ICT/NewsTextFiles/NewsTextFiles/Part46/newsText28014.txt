The shooting happened about 1:15 a.m. in the 4800 block of Ohio Street.

One woman, who didn't want to be identified, spoke to WSAZ.com after witnessing the terrifying ordeal. She says the men broke into the home, fired a warning shot and demanded money. She says she hid in the closet.

She and her boyfriend called police, but the suspects ran off before they could catch them.

She says, "When they left, they shot another round off."

This round hit her boyfriends brother, Danny Arthur, in the leg.

She says doctors weren't able to retrieve the bullet from his leg and he has lost some feeling near his knee. His injuries are described as non-life threatening.

The victims say they weren't able to see the suspects faces because they were wearing masks.
