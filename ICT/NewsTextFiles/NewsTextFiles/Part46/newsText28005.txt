An Allegiant Air flight bound for Wichita, Kansas, was evacuated Monday at Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport after the crew noticed the smell of smoke as the plane was taxiing, airport officials said.

The 162 passengers were taken back to the terminal, Sexton said. Six people reported minor injuries and were treated by paramedics at the airport, according to airport spokesman Brian Sexton.

Sexton said they believe the smoke came from the plane's electrical system. Airline officials are investigating exactly what caused the incident.

The passengers were served food and beverages during their wait for a new plane, which was scheduled to depart at 4 p.m., Sexton said.

The runways remained open, Sexton said.
