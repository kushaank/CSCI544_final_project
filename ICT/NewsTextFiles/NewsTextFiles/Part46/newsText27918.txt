
A partial bandh was observed in Chirala town on Monday following a call given by the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) alleging irregularities in the election of sitting Chirala MLA and Navodaya Party leader Amanchi Krishnamohan.

TDP activists went around the town enforcing the bandh and demanding a repoll in the constituency. Shops and business establishments in Gandhi Market and other areas remained closed for a while.

TDP candidate Pothula Sunitha had alleged foul play during the transport of EVMs. The number of EVMs given to polling agents soon after polling differed from that given at the time of counting, contended Ms. Sunitha, who lost to Mr Krishnamohan, former District Congress President, in the triangular contest.

YSRC candidate Yadam Balaji had also complained to Prakasam District Collector and District Election Officer G.S.R.K. Vijaykumar about irregularities in the conduct of election in the constituency.
