
NEW YORK (Standard & Poor's) May 19, 2014--Standard & Poor's Ratings Services assigned its 'AA' long-term rating to Connecticut's $650 million general obligation (GO) refunding bonds 2014 series C. At the same time, Standard & Poor's affirmed its 'AA' rating on the state's $13.7 billion parity debt outstanding. The outlook is stable.

"We expect that Connecticut will retain structural budget alignment over the two-year outlook horizon," said Standard & Poor's credit analyst David Hitchcock. "Slow revenue growth, the state's significant fixed-cost pressures, and still modest expected budget reserves despite a small projected deposit to the stabilization fund at the end of fiscal 2014, limit financial flexibility," added Mr. Hitchcock.

Connecticut has historically managed budget pressures, in our view, and above-average leverage and revenue volatility have been factors at the current rating level over time. We believe that the state is currently more vulnerable than other states to adverse trends in the economy given the fiscal strain of the past several years and slow economic growth. However, the state is projecting that it will perform slightly better than originally budgeted in fiscal 2014, and has enacted a balanced budget for fiscal 2015, albeit with what we view as a modest level of one-time budget items and no budgeted increase to reserves.
