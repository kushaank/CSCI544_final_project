
DUNMORE — After Al Senofonte bought Anna Maria’s Restaurant for $405,000 in October, he and his son Alec gutted the 984 E. Drinker St. building, spent a month doing renovations and recruited a professional chef from Philadelphia.

Serafina Restaurant emerged in November as a family establishment that serves not only Italian food like Anna Maria’s, but also a range of other food from duck to barbecued ribs.

Anna Maria’s was a well-known spot in Dunmore and made an appearance on the Feb. 22, 2012, episode of “Restaurant Impossible,” a reality show during which Chef Robert Irvine attempts to remake financially struggling restaurants with a budget of $10,000. The show depicted some unsanitary conditions at Anna Maria’s and sparked a local controversy about whether the portrayal was accurate.

The restaurant closed this past fall during some health issues among the Sileo family.

A borough resident, Mr. Senofonte spoke highly of Anna Maria’s, saying he “never had a bad meal there,” but the operation is now quite a bit different. Some patrons were initially a bit skeptical about the new menu, but Mr. Senofonte said many of them have become converts — and repeat customers.

He hoped to get an additional boost within the next two weeks when construction of an open-air, 15-by-50-foot deck is completed, which would add to the two-floor building’s nearly 200-person capacity.

The father and son team also run Falcon Express & Courier Services and Titan Tree Service, experience that boosted their confidence, even during the long winter.
