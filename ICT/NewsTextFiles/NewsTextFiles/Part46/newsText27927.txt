Apparently there are still some of us who don't.

So the California Highway Patrol is spearheading efforts now through June 1 around the state to pull over drivers who are not wearing seat belts or who allow passengers in their cars to not wear them.

Why are seat belts so important? They save lives. In 2012, according to figures from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, some 12,174 people didn't die in auto accidents they were in because they were wearing seat belts.

But, even if people are willing to risk their lives, perhaps they are less willing to risk cold, hard cash. Cost for not wearing a seat belt: $142. And for not properly restraining children under 16: a whopping $445.
