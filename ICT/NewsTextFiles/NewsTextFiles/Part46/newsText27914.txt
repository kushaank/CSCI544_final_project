
Last year 161 inmates were caught by the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment often by checking inmate rosters against unemployment claims and through other leads.

Joseph Borrego admitted to CBS4 he received more than $16,000 while sitting in the Boulder and Douglas County jails.

Inmates are able to game the system often by making a jobless claim before entering jail. Then usually with the help of an accomplice they are able to access the Department of Labor and Employment phone system. By claiming they are still eligible for unemployment insurance the money is transferred to a debit card.

“We have received tips and leads from the jails who have tape recorded conversations or videotapes of visits where an inmate may be saying please be sure that you request that unemployment benefit,” Cher Haavind told CBS4.

Borrego said the person that was helping him passed away and says he will pay the money back.

“If I have to go to jail that’s the consequences I’ve got to pay,” he said.

State records CBS4 examined also show Ronald E. Kelley collected $26,532 and Vincent Turner obtained $32,000.

Anthony Chavez is serving time for a 2007 Denver murder. The state says he got $11,000 in illegal jobless compensation. Documents allege his girlfriend helped access the phone system from the outside.

The girlfriend wasn’t home when a CBS4 went to her home to try to interview but her family members said they had no knowledge of the situation.
