Apparently, the "Portlandia" episode depicting two painfully polite drivers at a four-way stop in Portland -- "You go!" "No, you go!" – isn't too far from the truth.

Just how polite are the city's drivers? Well, Portland motorists are the least likely in the nation to say they honk their horns at other drivers, the survey found. Seattle came in second in that category, but failed to finish in the top 5 cities with the most courteous drivers.

For the survey, commuters in 25 big U.S. cities were asked about a host of driving behaviors related to road rage. This is the second time in five years that Portland has been ranked at the top. AutoVantage last conducted the survey in 2009, when Portland drivers also earned the title of most courteous.

The  AuotVantage survey measured behaviors such as speeding, running red lights, driving while talking on a cell phone, cutting between lanes without signaling and honking.

Yeah, this was a bad transit commute. A Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority bus crashed through a guardrail and fencing on an overpass Sunday , leaving the front of the vehicle hanging over the Massachusetts Pike, the AP reported. Eight people were injured, including the bus operator.
