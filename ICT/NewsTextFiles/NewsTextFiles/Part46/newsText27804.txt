
With finals over and fall commencement wrapping up, it's time to pack up and head home for thousands of University of Montana students.

NBC Montana stopped by an almost empty campus a few hours ago as some of the last few students were leaving their dorm rooms.

Some students call it bittersweet but they know they'll be back for the fall.

“It's been a heck of a ride but I am definitely excited for next year and for the summer. It's going to be great," said Andrew Guinn, a UM sophomore.

"Yeah I'm excited to leave Missoula but I'm excited to leave to go home to Oregon. I'll be back in August," said Melissa Rutherford, a UM sophomore.

Fall semester at the University of Montana starts August 25.
