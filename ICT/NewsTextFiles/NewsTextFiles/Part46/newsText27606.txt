
WATSONVILLE &GT;&GT; Black smoke billowing from a storage barn on Mount Madonna Road had fire reports flooding in to Cal Fire's dispatch Sunday evening.

The fire, reported about 6:30 p.m. on the 100 block of Mount Madonna Road, was confined to its place of origin in a barn being used for storage and as a garage, Cal Fire's Loree Borelli said.

The California Highway Patrol assisted with response, closing Mount Madonna Road for a time and then reopening one lane later in the evening.

The fire was knocked down by shortly after 7 p.m.

There were no injuries to humans or animals during the fire, Borelli said. Five vehicles and a boat inside the barn, however, sustained some damage.
