
On Monday, Oregon’s constitutional  ban on same sex marriage was overturned by U.S. District Judge Michael McShane. The amendment to the state constitution was passed by voters in 2004, and defined marriage as something between a man and a woman.

In his ruling, McShane said that the law in  Oregon banning same sex marriage was  unconstitutional – violating the  Equal Protection Clause of the 14th amendment.

This morning,  same-sex couples in Multnomah county waited outside a government building for the ruling to be announced, The attorneys and activists who had been involved in challenging the constitutional amendment celebrated as the ruling was announced.

This afternoon, Multnomah county, the most populous in the state, began issuing marriage licences to same sex couples wanting to marry.

The ruling in Oregon is  the latest in a series of court cases that have found states’ constitutional amendments against same sex marriage to be unconstitutional.
