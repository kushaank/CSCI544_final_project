A Simsbury ice skating rink is celebrating the installation of a 324 kilowatt solar array on Thursday.

C-TEC Solar of Simsbury installed the project at the International Skating Center of Connecticut this past fall, which produces approximately 40 percent of the facility's electrical needs.

Simsbury has been selected to participate in Solarize Simsbury, a 20-week program that is designed to make installing solar easy and affordable.

Attendees will be able to view the photovoltaic system close up, and refreshments will be served. An open skate — hosted by C-TEC Solar — will run from 4-5 p.m. Thursday.
