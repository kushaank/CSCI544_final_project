MADISON, Wis. — With the help of a U.S. Department of Agriculture small business grant, Wisconsin farmer-breeder Peter Pitts teamed up with Pure-Seed Testing Inc. of Hubbard, Ore., to create a now widely popular variety of conventional grass forage that also probably is the first certified organic festulolium in North America.

Pitts worked with Michael Casler, who was at that time a professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Today Casler is a grass breeder in Madison, at the U.S. Dairy Forage Research Center operated by the Agricultural Research Service.

ARS is USDA’s principal intramural scientific research agency, and the research supports the USDA commitment to sustainable agriculture.

Intrigued by Pitts’ success with festulolium, a ryegrass with a small number of meadow fescue genes, Casler bred the grass with festulolium growing in old university nursery plots throughout Wisconsin. These plants had survived many years of “get tough or die” conditions like those on Pitts’ old pasture on his 350-acre, mostly organic beef cattle farm.

Pure-Seed Testing’s breeder, Crystal Fricker, screened the plants in Oregon for stem rust resistance, yield, and other desired characteristics. In 1996, breeder seed of the new variety, Spring Green, was produced.

Rose Agri-Seed Inc., a sister company of Pure-Seed Testing Inc., obtained marketing rights for Spring Green. The seed proved so popular that it is used throughout the world.
