
DNR officials said that although the restrictions were lifted, residents in those counties could have more specific regulations or restrictions, so they should check with local authorities to get permits before burning. The counties that had the restriction lifted include: Anoka, Benton, Chisago, Dakota, Douglas, Isanti, Hennepin, Kanabec, Mille Lacs, Morrison, Pine, Pope, Ramsey, Sherburne, Stearns Todd, Washington and Wright.

The DNR said the restrictions were lifted due to a decrease in fire danger because of recent wet conditions and the green-up moving north in Minnesota. Restrictions remain in effect in as many as 20 other Minnesota counties, mostly in far northern and northwestern Minnesota.

If you plan on doing any burning, authorities said to be sure to keep your piles small, have a water supply nearby and stay around the fire until it is completely out.
