NORMAN — A former state Senate president offered to pay a Noble police officer $40,000 and then $50,000 to release him after being arrested, prosecutors allege in a felony case filed Monday.

Cal Hobson — who is a candidate for Cleveland County commissioner — was arrested Sunday in Noble on a drunken driving complaint, court records show.

Hobson blew a 0.27 on a breathalyzer test of his blood alcohol concentration — more than three times the legal limit, the records show.

Hobson, 69, of Lexington, was charged Monday with two felonies — aggravated driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and attempting to bribe an officer.

Hobson also offered to make a Noble police officer, David Gazaway, the police chief if the officer would “cut him a break,” prosecutors allege.

Officer Gazaway refused the defendant’s offers of bribes, according to the charge.

The case was filed in Cleveland County District Court. Hobson was still in jail Monday afternoon and could not be reached for comment.

Hobson, a Democrat, was elected to the House of Representatives in 1978 and to the Senate in 1990.

He was elected Senate president pro tem in January 2003 and re-elected to the post in January 2005. He resigned that leadership position in March 2005 at the request of fellow Democrats.
