
ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — Gambling regulators say illegal Internet betting is happening across the United States, and that's hurting the fledgling online gambling industries in the three states that have legalized it.

Speaking Monday at the East Coast Gaming Congress in Atlantic City, regulators say illegal offshore gambling sites continue to operate.

That competition is one of the reasons Internet gambling has gotten off to a slower start than many expected.

New Jersey saw its first decline in Internet gambling revenue in April, falling to $11.4 million from $11.9 million in March. California gambling control commissioner Richard Schuetz (SHOOTS) says $300 million to $400 million a year is wagered in his state on illegal Internet sites.

Brian Mattingley, CEO of 888.com, says only 10 percent of New Jerseyans realize Internet gambling is legal here.
