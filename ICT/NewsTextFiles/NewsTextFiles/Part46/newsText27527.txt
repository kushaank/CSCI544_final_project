
After 11 years without an official home base, The Educational Tech Foundation moved into new office space in the Ellicott Square Building, thanks to the generosity of Ellicott Development Co.

Ellicott Development donated 1,000 square feet of office space on the third floor of Ellicott Square Building.

Ed Tech is staffed completely by volunteers who are mostly information technology professionals. Building and refurbishing computers is central to the foundationâ€™s mission to make technology accessible to children in under-served communities. Since its founding in 2003, the foundation has helped Western New York children in more than 90 schools and community centers by providing and installing computers, servers, networks, smartboards and infrastructure.
