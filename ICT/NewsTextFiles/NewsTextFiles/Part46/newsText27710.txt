JUNEAU , Alaska (AP) - A 34-year-old Juneau man has been found dead near a Tenakee Springs accident site.

Juneau radio station KINY reports Alaska State Troopers identified the victim as James Russell Vavalis .

Troopers say he was found Sunday morning near a flipped over four-wheeler on the beach at Graveyard Point, just east of Tenakee Springs.

Troopers spokeswoman tells Anchorage television station KTUU that it wasn’t immediately known when the accident happened. He had been helping family members in the area build a cabin, and was last seen about 11:30 p.m. Saturday.

Authorities don’t suspect foul play in the death. The body will be sent to the State Medical Examiner’s Office in Anchorage for an autopsy.

Tenakee Springs is located on the east side of Chichagof Island, about 45 miles southwest of Juneau .
