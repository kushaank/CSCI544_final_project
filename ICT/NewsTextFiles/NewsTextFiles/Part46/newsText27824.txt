NEWARK, N.J. (AP) â€” A plane taking off and another plane landing on intersecting runways at Newark Liberty Airport nearly collided last month, according to a preliminary federal report.

The National Transportation Safety Board report classified the April 24 incident between a United flight coming from San Francisco and an ExpressJet flight bound for Memphis as a near midair collision. According to the report, the planes came within approximately 200 feet laterally. They were separated by about 400 feet vertically.

The United flight was carrying 155 passengers and six crew members. The ExpressJet flight was carrying 47 passengers and three crew members.

According to the NTSB report, an air traffic controller waited for another plane to land on the east-west runway, then cleared the ExpressJet to take off heading north. At that point, the United flight was about three miles away. By the time the ExpressJet flight started its takeoff roll, the United flight was about one mile away.

As the two planes approached each other, the United flight was ordered by the tower to abort its landing and go back up.
