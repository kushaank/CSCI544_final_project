
Three re-elected Lubbock city council members also taking their oath of office Monday.

Mayor Glen Robertson ran unopposed in the city election. Incumbents Victor Hernandez and Karen Gibson held on to District One and District 5 respectively. Both council members said a new term brings a new energy, and another chance to get things done.

"One thing I really want to do going forward is see if we can't get the county and city meshing better. That would be one thing I'd want to do differently, not that we haven't tried, I just feel like that should come to fruition in the next few years," said Gibson.

"I think I'm going to be more focused in terms of ordinances and resolutions and projects for the district," said Hernandez.

There will be a June 14 runoff election between Jeff Griffith and Deanne Clark for the District Three seat. Todd Klein did not seek reelection.
