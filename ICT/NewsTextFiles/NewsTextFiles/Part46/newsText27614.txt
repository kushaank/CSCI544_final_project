
Paul George and David West combined for 43 points as the Indiana Pacers never gave defending champions Miami Heat a chance to grab a single lead, winning Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals 107-96 in Indianapolis.

The Pacers tough defense clamped down on the Heat’s shooters, allowing them only 6-of-23 shooting from the three-point range, while making 8-of-19 of their own. Miami was trailing behind big and early, and they never got going to even tie the score.

The Heat were lead by Dwyane Wade’s 27 points and Lebron Jame’s 25 points with 10 rebounds, but the Pacers sank six of their first seven shots from beyond the arc, leading by as much as 19 at one point and never looked back.
