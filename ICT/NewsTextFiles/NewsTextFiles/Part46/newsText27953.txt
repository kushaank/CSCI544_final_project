As the head of the tribe's cultural resource department pointed out in a letter to the board, Twain once referred to the Washoe as "the digger tribe," a derogatory name used for tribes that dug roots to eat. Twain also opposed naming the lake Tahoe, which came from the Washoe word for lake, "da ow."

The board voted this week to indefinitely table the request to name the cove for Samuel Clemens, Twain's real name, the AP reports. The board member behind it says it's unlikely to resurface, out of respect for the tribe. He initially proposed it because he believes Twain camped at the cove in 1861—and accidentally started a wildfire while preparing to cook dinner. Twain did once write a letter objecting to the treatment of tribes in Arizona and New Mexico, but an English professor says there's little evidence he overcame his anti-Native American prejudices. "When it comes to African Americans, he was ahead of his time substantially," the professor says. "When it comes to Native Americans, his record is not very good."

Twain's Huckleberry Finn was banned in El Segundo as being racist: the ludicrousness of such acts shows pea-brain understanding of the difference between the literary technique of giants like Twain and comic-book readers like El Segundo officials and the protesting 'native Americans'.
