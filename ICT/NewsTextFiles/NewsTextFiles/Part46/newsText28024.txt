SANDUSKY, Ohio — Seven people were shot overnight Saturday at a northwestern Ohio bar, but none of the injuries was expected to be life-threatening, police told Ohio television stations.

But the Sandusky Register reported that a severely beaten man was flown to a hospital early yesterday. His condition wasn’t immediately known.

Police had made no arrests last night and said there might have been multiple shooters.

WTOL-TV in Toledo reported that the trouble started about 4 a.m. WEWS-TV in Cleveland reported that police said the beaten man and two of those shot were found in the bar’s parking lot and that the other five people showed up later at a hospital, saying they had been shot at the bar.

Police said they couldn’t say whether the altercation was gang-related.

Messages left for police weren’t immediately returned yesterday.
