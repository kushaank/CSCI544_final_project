
A group of US state regulators is working to develop the first ever bitcoin rulebook, stating that they hope to protect those who are using the virtual currency by introducing proper regulation.

Many US companies are now allowing customers to pay for goods and   services with the virtual currency.

â€œWe may be looking at some type of model definitions, or   model laws or regulations, and very likely recommendations to   either our federal colleagues or to Congress,â€� David Cotney,   Massachusetts commissioner of banks, told Reuters during a public   hearing about bitcoin on Friday.

Cotney took up his position as head of the new nine-member   Emerging Payments Task Force in February. The collective has   granted itself a year to complete the task of establishing the   guidelines.

Bitcoin was denied currency status by the IRS in May, meaning   that taxpayers must treat bitcoin as property for federal tax   purposes.

Because bitcoin is not regulated by the federal government, US   constituent states may be facing a labyrinth of rules to govern   its usage.

The task force hopes to clarify operators that need to be   regulated and those that donâ€™t, Cotney told the agency.

â€œWho's in and who's out? So if we can offer that [it] would   be a...big step,â€� he said. Cotney's group also examines   other new payment technologies, including online money transfer   service PayPal and mobile phone payment services.

From May 9, US politicians could begin accepting bitcoin   donations. In February, US-based CheapAir became the first online   travel agency to accept bitcoin as a form of payment for flights   and hotel bookings.

However, recent disruptions have thrown the currency into the   limelight. Mt. Gox â€“ Tokyoâ€™s most well known bitcoin exchange -   filed for bankruptcy in February after losing some $US650 million   worth of clientsâ€™ bitcoins. China then shut down two major   trading platforms at the beginning of May.

Regulators say they want to ensure that usage of the   cryptocurrency remains secure.

A member of the task force, New York-based Benjamin Lawksy,   stated in January that his department was devising a â€œBitLicenseâ€� system in which California has expresed   interest.

Many countries, including Russia, have warned against using   bitcoin, while Denmark and China have banned virtual currency   deposits.

Alanna Skelly, your hostile attitude toward liberty and your belief that government can and should ban bitcoin is exactly why bitcoin was created. The only way bitcoin can be stopped is to crush the the liberties and lives of those who choose to exchange legal goods and services with bitcoin or save for retirement by investing in bitcoin. Regardless if anyone has ever been or will be harmed.

@Alanna Skelly: It saddens me to hear your bashing of Bitcoins, since cryptocurrencies, of which Bitcoin is the foremost, is the greatest economic invention for years. The positive impact that cryptocurrencies will have on society, democratization of capital and the economy at large far outweighs the greatly exaggerated negative impact you refer to.

The current, international banking regime that is the gatekeeper of money flow is an expensive, dated institution that taxes society, hinders innovation and creates economic bubbles. Bitcoins will liberate capital flow, like the internet liberated the flow of information.
