
GREENSBORO, N.C. — It’s been nearly 50 years since Carletta Judd pulled out her Girl Scouts’ handbook.

At 61, she still carries pieces of the uniform she once wore with pride and remembers the life skills she learned every summer at Camp Douglas Long in Greensboro.

To Judd, her sister and her mother, who was a Girl Scouts’ leader, the camp was like home and one of the few places they could go during segregation in the 1960s.

“That was all we had,” Judd said.

But in two weeks, the camp which takes up 112 acres may have new owners. The property is to be auctioned off to the highest bidder at the end of the month.

The camp was bought by the Girl Scouts in 1949. Its current value is close to $700,000.

“It’s rare to find a property with all these characteristics in this location,” Smitherman said.

The location has two streams, 40 cabins and original wood framing from the 1930s.

“If that doesn’t qualify it to be a gem, I don’t know what would,” he said.

A gem Girl Scouts like Judd hope is kept intact for others to also one day call home.
