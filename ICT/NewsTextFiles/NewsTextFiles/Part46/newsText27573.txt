My heartiest congratulations to you young men!  I did the same thing 48 years ago, and the things I learned served me well....still do, as a matter of fact, every time I head for the farm, hunt, fish, camp, or try to make a good decision about anything.

Really nice job....all of you.  It's not a PC thing you did, but you should be proud and you WILL be pleased at how well the things you learned will serve you and your life.
