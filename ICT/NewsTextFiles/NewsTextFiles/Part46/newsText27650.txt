
TUPELO, Miss. (WTVA) -- Eight people were honored Saturday for their contributions to diversity in the Magnolia State at the twelfth annual Mississippi Trailblazers Awards Ceremony.

"This is where the entire community comes together to represent people who have literally blazed the trail of diversity," awards ceremony supporter Tom Robinson said.

The evening's star recipient was Robert Clark.

"My life has not been about me," Clark said.Â "It's been about helping the people of Mississippi."

Clark was the first African American to be elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1967.

He was also the first African American chairman of the House Education Committee.

In 1992, he became the Speaker Pro Tempore.

All of his accomplishments have allowed drastic changes to be made in the state, but he said there's still more to be done.

"It burns me to my heart to see that Mississippi is at the bottom of the ladder of all the states in this nation," Clark said.

"It lets me know that there are other individuals who have the same concern I have," Clark said.

He hopes that in time even more steps will be taken to advance diversity.
