
Cheese.

Cue "We Are The Champions" and roll out the cheese wheel because according to a post from the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation, Wisconsin is still the nation's largest cheese producer. The USDA's 2013 Dairy Products Summary shows that Wisconsin contributed 25.7% of the country's total cheese production in 2013.

And by the way, 2.856 billion pounds of cheese is the equivalent of almost 16 Washington Monuments. THE MORE YOU KNOW.
