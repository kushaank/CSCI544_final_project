The desktop measures nearly 48 inches wide by 23 inches deep. It has air vents for keeping a laptop cool, a mouse pad that is flush with the surface, and docking stations for a smart phone and tablet.  It’s also got a recessed cup holder for your coffee mug.

Note: The winners of last week’s nail giveaway were Dawn Detgen of Salisbury and Terri Jarina, of Waxhaw.
