COLERAIN TWP., Ohio - One dog was killed and another was rescued from a house fire in the 3800 block of Windsong Drive in Colerain Township Monday afternoon, officials said.

Reports of smoke coming through windows of the home reached the fire department just after 1 p.m., according to Capt. Darian Edwards. When crews arrived, they found smoke coming from the first and second floor, and flames coming out from the basement.

They determined that the blaze began in the basement, where they heard multiple "pops" that sounded like ammunition, Edwards said.

About 20 minutes before firefighters arrived on scene, neighbors called police when they heard possible shots fired nearby.

The cause of the fire remained under investigation Monday night.

Firefighters from Springfield Township were called to help the Colerain units on scene, Edwards said. The teams had the fire under control in about 90 minutes.
