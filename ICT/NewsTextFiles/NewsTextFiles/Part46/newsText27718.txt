
Experts have said that the new Nova Star ferry at the Ocean Gateway terminal is helping boost the local businesses in Portland.

Several local businesses have started benefitting from the ripple effects from the new ferry in the Portland area. Bill's Pizza on Commercial Street in Portland got an order of 100 pizzas and Two Fat Cats Bakery on India Street received an order of 800 pastries, giving them much extra businesses during the days.

The bakery has tripled production as it also received a contract for regular supply of pastries to the terminal. Brown Ship Services is has received orders for frozen and fresh food and Laurie Andrews Design in Saco is offering flower center pieces for the tables in the ship's restaurants.

The Nova Scotia government is planning to spend $21 million over seven years in order to subsidize the new ferry service in order to bring more American tourists to the province. Many believe that this investment will boost expenditure in the Portland area during the coming years.

The Nova Star has said that it will sue Portland as its home port instead of cruise ships that have their own provisions for food and other products. Portland-area vendors will be supplying fuel and services for the ferry service.
