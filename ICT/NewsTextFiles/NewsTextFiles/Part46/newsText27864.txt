
NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — Joshua Henry is up for a Tony Award for the same role he played as a college sophomore.

Henry, 29, said he has a much different approach to playing the character now than he did in 2003.

“It being my first college production, it’s all about just getting the notes right and just hitting my marks,” he said. “But over a decade later now, I’ve got just a little more life experience, and it’s about the depth of who Flick is.

Henry’s co-star Sutton Foster is also nominated for best leading actress in a musical. The show is nominated for best musical revival, and the show’s director, Leigh Silverman, also earned a Tony nod.
