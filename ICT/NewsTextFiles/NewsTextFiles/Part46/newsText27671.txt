Old household items and clothing will be turned into an unforgettable camp experience for kids with cancer and their siblings as Arizona Camp Sunrise hosts a Weigh to Fundraise drive at Summit School of Ahwatukee on Saturday, May 31.

Items can be dropped off at the school, 4515 E. Muirwood Drive, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on May 31.

Arizona Camp Sunrise and Sidekicks, which provides a fun, free and medically safe summer camp for kids diagnosed with cancer and their siblings, will receive a monetary donation based on the total weight of the items collected.

Donations of clothing, housewares, accessories, small appliances, toys and other items are welcome. The group cannot accept TVs, mattresses, hazardous waste, oil paints, ammunition, fire arms, computer monitors and hide-a-bed sofas.

Arizona Camp Sunrise (ACS) was formerly funded through the Arizona Cancer Society. Just over a year ago ACS announced it would no longer be funding programs for kids nationally. A group of volunteers from Camp Sunrise decided to preserve camp and the programs surrounding it and formed Southwest Kids Cancer Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, to continue their mission.

In addition to the week-long camp, the organization hosts several retreats for campers throughout the year and day camp at the Summit School of Ahwatukee during the summer. All programs are free to kids diagnosed with cancer and their siblings and are operated by unpaid volunteers.
