
If Karl Rove hoped to generate some chatter with his cheap shot at Hillary Clinton last week, he succeeded — the political world has now been chewing on the “brain damage” story for nearly a week. But by all appearances, Rove has started a conversation that’s focused more on his propensity for sleazy tactics than the former Secretary of State’s health.

Karl Rove wanted to manufacture a story about Hillary Clinton. He instead created a story about Karl Rove.

I disagree. The press has been talking about Rove's sleazy tactics for more than a decade. Rove is used to that and obviously doesn't care. There's just nothing new on that front, and even if this did somehow damage Rove, it wouldn't have any effect on the Republicans actually running against Hillary in 2016.

But there's not much question that Rove has generated a lot of buzz about Hillary's health. By itself, this isn't a big deal, but as part of the nonstop mudslinging that Hillary will have to endure for the next couple of years, it's perfect. Every one of these incidents will be designed to sow a small seed of doubt, and eventually one or two of these seeds might catch on and blossom into an acorn. And from tiny acorns, mighty oaks sometime grow. Mission accomplished!
