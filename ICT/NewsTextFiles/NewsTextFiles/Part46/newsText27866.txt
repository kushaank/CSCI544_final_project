
CRISFIELD, Md. – Property taxes could be going up under a two-tier tax plan that is moving forward in Crisfield.

The Crisfield City Council recently reviewed and approved the first reading of an ordinance that would raise property taxes from 70 cents to 81 cents per $100 of assessed value. The ordinance still has to clear a few hurdles before taking effect at the beginning of the next fiscal year.

The increase would apply to people living or occupying business space in Crisfield.

People who own rental or vacant properties could end up paying double the increase, if certain standards are not met.

Mitchell Annhill lives in Crisfield. She is against a property tax increase. She said a lot of people are struggling financially.

  "I don't think it's a very good idea right now because the people in this town just don't have the money for it," Annhill said.

Michael Wigglesworth agrees with Annhill.  Though his household has two incomes, he said an increase will be hard on some people who do not.

Not everyone is opposed to the tax hike, Karen Hosea supports the city’s plan , if it will move Crisfield forward.

“If we want to increase Crisfield, [better our] livelihoods…you've got to pay the taxes," she said.

A second reading on the ordinance is pending in Somerset County.
