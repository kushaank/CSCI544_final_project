FAIRFAX, Va. (WUSA9) -- Next weekend, thousands of motorcyclists will be in the D.C. area for the Rolling Thunder Motorcycle Ride.

Virginia Department of Transportation officials want to remind drivers that the motorcyclists will start their journey at 8 a.m. Sunday. Overhead message signs will alert motorists to expect delays from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.

Approximately 2,000 motorcycles will enter the northbound I-95 HOV lanes just north of Dale City in Prince William County, and another 2,000 will enter I-66 from Manassas and head east to the Pentagon, according to officials.

At noon, riders will ride into the District of Columbia.

Officials with the Washington National Cathedral say they will welcome  approximately 100 to 150 bikes the Friday before for  the Blessing of the Bikes. The event is part of the cathedral's "initiative to honor those who serve and to offer a place of spiritual healing for the nation's veterans," said officials in a press release. There will be a brief ceremony, special tours and more.
