
TUPELO, Miss., May 19 (UPI) -- The Mississippi man who pled guilty to sending ricin-laced letters to President Obama and other officials was sentenced to 25 years in prison Monday.

James Everett Dutschke plead guilty in January for mailing the highly toxic substance to President Obama, Mississippi Senator Roger Wicker and Justice Court Judge Sadie Holland. He briefly withdrew that plea, but reconsidered last week to avoid the threat of a life sentence.

The failed assassination attempts were not politically motivated, rather a failed attempt by Dutschke to frame Elvis impersonator Kevin Curtis . Just small doses of the castor-bean-derived substance are deadly to human beings.

Dutschke will also serve a five-year sentence of supervised release when he is reintegrated. He will be 66 when he is released.
