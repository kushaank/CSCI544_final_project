
(PIKEVILLE, TN) — A Tennessee town decided to ban sagging pants.

The city of Pikeville, Tenn., doesn’t want its residents to be caught with their pants down.

The City Council unanimously approved an ordinance on its first reading Monday night that would require anyone guilty of public indecency, which includes anyone wearing their bottoms “more than three inches below the top of the hips (crest of the ilium),” to pay a fine of “not less than” $25 for a first offense and “not more than” $50 on the subsequent offenses.

Other offenses listed include lewd and sexual acts, publicly relieving oneself and indecent exposure of body parts.

Cagle said that before proposing the local public indecency legislation, the city had abided by the state’s public indecency laws. However, Cagle said that he did not know what the state’s law said, so he couldn’t explain how the ordinance was different.
