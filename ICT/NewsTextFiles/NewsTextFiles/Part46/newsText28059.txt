
MARICOPA, Ariz. â€“ Maricopa police arrested a 21-year-old man accused of killing his 43-year-old girlfriend early Sunday morning.

Miguel Daniel Tapia was booked into the Pinal County Detention Center on felony charges of second-degree murder, aggravated assault and tampering with physical evidence.

Police responded to the 40000 block of West Cydnee Drive just before 6 a.m. after receiving a 911 call from a neighbor.

According to police spokesman Ricardo Alvarado, they found Holly Berry dead in the backyard with injuries to her face, abdomen and arms.

Alvarado said officers saw blood in the kitchen area leading to the yard. They also said the tile floor was wet and appeared to have been recently washed with water.

Tapia told police that Berry "got stupid" and they had pushed each other back and forth until she fell and stopped talking.

"Tapia also told officers he blew breaths into her mouth for one to two hours before attempting to get help," Alvarado said in a news release.
