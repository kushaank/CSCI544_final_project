
WAUSAU, Wis. (WSAU) -- Public access television in Wausau could have a new funding mechanism, and additional programs soon. Wausau’s City Council voted to allow a special non-profit fund to be created outside of the council and within the Community Foundation of North Central Wisconsin, if the Community Foundation’s board agrees to do it.

The Community Foundation of North Central Wisconsin board may take this issue up at this week’s meeting.
