
Southwest Airlines plans to discontinue its nonstop flight from Charlotte to Orlando as of Nov. 1, the company said Monday.

A spokesman said its possible that the flight could return  Southwest hasnt loaded its schedule past Jan. 4  but added theres no indication as of now that the flight will come back.

Southwest started flying from Charlotte last year, after acquiring low-cost carrier AirTran. The airline currently offers six daily nonstop flights to four destinations: Orlando International Airport, Houstons Hobby Airport, Baltimore-Washington International, and Chicago Midway International.

Southwests flights from Charlotte to its other three destinations wont change, the company said.
