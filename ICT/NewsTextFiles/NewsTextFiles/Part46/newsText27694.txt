LINTHICUM, Md. (AP) - The U.S. Department of Transportation has awarded more than $11 million in grants for runway improvements at BWI Airport.

The money awarded through the Airport Improvement Program will be used for runway improvements, including new 35-foot runway shoulders for the length of the runway, modifications to the runway-taxiway intersections and lighting improvements.

The project is part of a $350 million effort to bring all of the airports runways into compliance with federal safety standards by 2015.

The grants were announced Monday by Maryland Sens. Senators Barbara Mikulski and Ben Cardin and Congressman John Sarbanes.
