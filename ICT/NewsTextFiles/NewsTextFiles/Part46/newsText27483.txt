
Christopher Haag told South Daytona police he was asleep while an intruder killed his wife of six years.

Investigators found Rosemarie Haag, 45, lying in a pool of blood about 1 a.m. Monday in the hall near the front door of the condominium the couple shared on Banana Cay Drive. She had "extensive head trauma," an arrest report shows.

Officers soon doubted Haag's story.

Signs of a struggle were obvious, according to the report: several large holes in the walls, stained clothing strewn about, a clump of red hair in a dog's cage that matched the victim's and severe rug burn on her back.

There also was a pool of blood under a door mat outside and a trail of blood described as "drag marks" leading into the condo. Investigators found a wedding ring on the ground on a rear patio.

"The defendant's claims to have slept on the couch while the extremely violent homicide occurred within feet of him is incredible," police wrote in the report.

They arrested Christopher Haag, 38, about 9:30 a.m. on a charge of second-degree murder.

Haag called 911 â€” but only after he spoke by phone to his mother for nearly half an hour and then contacted his drug dealer, according to the report.

He told a dispatcher he was afraid to call the police because he is on misdemeanor probation, the report states.

He pleaded no contest in March to driving under the influence and in February 2012 to domestic battery. Christopher Haag served a two-year prison sentence for throwing a deadly missile into a vehicle in 2003.

He was being held without bail Monday at the Volusia County Branch Jail.
