The family of a 22-year-old woman who fell down an elevator shaft at Fenway Park last week says she remains hospitalized in serious condition and her prognosis is "uncertain."

Their statement Tuesday said Elisabeth Scotland of Brigantine, New Jersey, is receiving treatment at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and asked for privacy. The family thanked first responders, medical caregivers, the Boston Red Sox and others who have supported them in Boston and their hometown.

Scotland, who had just graduated from Boston University, fell from the fourth floor to the roof of an elevator stopped on the second floor after the Friday night Detroit Tigers-Red Sox game.

State investigators have said "extreme force" against the bottom of the elevator door may have broken its safety framing and created a gap through which she fell.
