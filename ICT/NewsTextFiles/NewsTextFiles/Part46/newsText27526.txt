Even though the primary building on an Illinois apple farm was destroyed by a fire, the owner says he will welcome guests this fall.

MARINE, Ill. (KSDK) – Even though the primary building on an Illinois apple farm was destroyed by a fire, the owner says he will welcome guests this fall.

The fire tore through Mills Apple Farm on May 4. Owner Jerry Mills says the market, bakery, cider operation, wreath-making equipment, coolers, walk-in freezer (which contained hundreds of gallons of cider and many apple pies worth of filling) were totally lost.

Mills said he doesn't have insurance – and hasn't for about 10 years.

"I had several losses in a row, and the insurance company canceled me, and replacement insurance was very high and I couldn't afford it," he said.

Mills said the trees are fine, and they'll welcome visitors this fall for apple, wagon rides and music no matter what.
