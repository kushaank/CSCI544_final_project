
BMW CEO of BMW of North America, Ludwig Willisch, has put a US sales target on the BMW i8 for 2014.

According to Willisch, sales of the limited production BMW i8 will be less than 500 in the US in 2014.

Perhaps the low sales volume in the US can be contributed to the late launch, which is now reportedly set for August in the US, or maybe it’s the $135,925 price tag that will limit sales.

For the record, the BMW i8 was initially set to launch in the US in Spring 2014.  It’s now looking like it will be August before first sales of the i8 commence in the States.

How many times do I have to tell you guys.

The I8 is just an i3 motor assy up front and a hot turbo 3 in the back.

Probably zero R&D as they used existing components..

If that’s true, the base i3 seems notebly overpriced when it only has Nissan Leaf range.  And the utilization of the REx varies greatly, depending what country you purchase it in.

Speaking of REx, if gas tanks were like penises, I would point and laugh at it.  And I hate gas tanks.

It will be interesting to see how long BMW can keep up demand for the i3.

I say… Good show, ‘ol bean!
