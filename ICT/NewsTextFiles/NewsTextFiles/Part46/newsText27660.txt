Spartanburg County Council is crossing its fingers that $700,000 will reappear in the state budget.

Council chose not to adjust the 2014-2015 proposed budget to reflect the S.C. Senate’s cut of nearly $16 million from the local government fund, which could cost Spartanburg County $700,000 in budgeted revenue. The $177 million budget with an $84 million general fund passed unanimously at Monday’s council meeting.

Council Chairman Jeff Horton said he’s been assured by area senators that the local government fund will be restored to at least last year’s funding level when the budget goes to a conference committee with the House of Representatives. The House version of the budget provides the same amount of funding to local governments as was given last year, which is the amount county administrators budgeted.

“If (it’s) not, by third reading, we have some pencil sharpening to do,” Horton said.

Horton said eliminating a 2.5 percent raise for county employees, which is slated to cost $1.2 million, will not be an option to rebalance the budget if the state funding does not come through.

One of the options might be to make some capital purchases using reserve funds, with the understanding that money will be paid back with any surplus funds that become available, O’Neill said. Spartanburg County budget policy mandates 10 percent of the prior year’s budget be held in reserve for emergencies, and the county’s current finances are barely compliant with that goal. A healthy fund balance for local governments is considered to be closer to 20 percent.

In other business, council approved the expansion of two business parks, including one that will encompass the future Bass Pro Shops location. O’Neill said this is a step toward preparing the county’s fee-in-lieu-of-tax incentive agreement.
