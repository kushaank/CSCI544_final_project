
The Boys & Girls Club of Central Florida held a record-breaking auction during its annual Celebrate the Children event on Friday at the Orlando Marriott World Center.

The event, which funds a big part of the clubs' operating expenses for the year, raised $750,000 in profit. That’s on top of the expense of throwing the party.

The auction itself raised $130,000, lead by auction chair Julie Anderson, VP of digital publishing for the Sentinel. A smart phone app by Indiana-based Qtego allowed bidding to start a few days in advance.

“It was new and unique, and we did a good job of promoting it,” said Aimee Thompson, VP of development and marketing.

Several performances during the dinner program wowed the audience, including the National Anthem sung by a young club member, and an address by 18-year-old Maryah Sullivan . She impressed with her determined focus on overcoming adversity and becoming a neurosurgeon.

Cheryl Smith, national sales VP with Tupperware, led the live round of donations that quickly filled up a large heart-shaped artwork on a projector screen to top $70,000.
