
PITTSBURGH--( BUSINESS WIRE )--The chill is off Bruster’s Real Ice Cream, again named one of America’s        top frozen treat chains in a national consumer study. For the first time        in 12 years, the 200-unit premium ice cream brand recorded four        continuous quarters of same-store sales growth.

It also has just signed two franchise development agreements. Renita and        Reggie Watkins, new Bruster’s franchisees, are currently searching for a        site in Northern Virgina to open the brand’s second four seasons        prototype. Featuring indoor seating and an expanded menu that includes        soft-serve frozen yogurt and real-fruit smoothies, the new concept is        key to Bruster’s growth strategy.

P.J. and Sapna Patel, also new franchisees, are looking for a site in        St. Augustine, Fla. to open either a stand-alone shop or a four-seasons        prototype, the first of which opened in January in Savannah, Ga. It is        exceeding projections, according to Jim Sahene, Bruster’s CEO.

Bruster’s, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary,        typically builds free-standing shops. The new prototype was created for        in-line shopping centers, greatly reducing development costs.

“The high-energy, colorful environment and indoor seating, combined with        America’s best ice cream and contemporary, new products, is working        extremely well in the first new unit. Its early success proves we are on        the right track for our next 25 years,” Sahene said.

“Mentoring Tomorrow's Leaders Today” serves as Bruster's foundation        and business platform. Celebrating its 25thanniversary,        Bruster’s features 200 handcrafted ice cream, yogurt, Italian ice and        sorbet recipes, with up to 38 made fresh daily in each shop. There are        nearly 200 independently owned locations in 18 states and the nation of        Guyana. With a new four seasons prototype and enhanced menu featuring        soft-serve yogurt and smoothies, Bruster’s is expanding in selected        areas of the U.S. It is based in suburban Pittsburgh.
