
According to Loudoun County Fire-Rescue, just before 4 a.m. Monday emergency calls came in reporting a fire in the 200 Block of St. John Square in Sterling Park. Fire-rescue personnel from Sterling, Cascades, Kincora, Ashburn, Moorefield, Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, and Fairfax County responded to the incident.

The first firefighters on scene discovered a fire in the backyard of one of the townhouses. The fire was spreading up the exterior of the townhouse and into the attic and roof of three townhouses. All residents already were safely out of the home.

Firefighters were able to contain the fire, but because of significant fire and smoke damage to two of the townhouses and smoke damage to two others, 15 people have been unable to return to their homes. The American Red Cross was called to assist the families.

There were no injuries reported.

The Loudoun County Fire Marshal’s Office concluded the fire was accidental, caused by an outdoor fire pit with contents that had not been properly extinguished. Damages are estimated at $450,000.

• The appliance should be placed at least 15 feet away from any home or residence, and away from nearby combustible materials, such as decks, exterior walls and plants or other outside decorative material so they do not ignite from radiant heat.

• Put the appliance on a level, non-combustible surface, such as stone, brick, or concrete. If it must be placed on grass or on any other combustible surface, place a fire resistant pad underneath the appliance and monitor it closely.

• By law, an adult who has a way to extinguish the fire readily available must attend any fire.

• The appliance is to be used within the manufacture’s specifications, including the use of the sturdy screen to contain sparking or flying embers.

• Use seasoned hardwood as fuel for the fire. Avoid using soft wood such as pine or cedar that likely generate more smoke, pop and throw sparks.

• Always let ashes cool before putting them into a closed metal container. The metal container should be kept outside, a safe distance away from the home or any other structures.

• Teach kids how to be responsible when around these types of appliances, but always ensure an adult is present during their use.

• Prior to lighting the fire, evaluate wind conditions to see if it is safe and where the smoke will be blowing. Exercise the same precautions as you would with any open fire.
