
Bozeman, MTÂ -( Ammoland.com )- As part of an ongoing program to monitor the population of grizzly bears in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem (NCDE), Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks, the US Fish & Wildlife Service, the National Park Service, and Tribal wildlife managers will once again begin seasonal scientific capture operations in parts of western Montana this month.

From May through the end of October, biologists will work in the Blackfoot Valley, along the Rocky Mountain Front, in the Swan and Clearwater River Valleys, within Glacier National Park, and in the North and Middle Forks of the Flathead River. Traps will also be set periodically on private and public lands where bear/human conflicts are occurring.

Warning signs will be posted along the major access points to the trapping site, and it is critical that all members of the public heed these signs.

Monitoring of grizzly bear distribution and population trend is vital to ongoing recovery of grizzlies in the NCDE . Potential trapping sites are baited with natural food sources and snares or culvert traps are used to capture the bears. Once captured, the bears are sedated, studied, and released in accordance with strict protocols.

The mission of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ( USFWS ) is working with others to conserve, protect, and enhance fish, wildlife, plants, and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people. We are both a leader and trusted partner in fish and wildlife conservation, known for our scientific excellence, stewardship of lands and natural resources, dedicated professionals, and commitment to public service.

Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks ( MFWP ) through its employees and citizen commission, provides for the stewardship of the fish, wildlife, parks, and recreational resources of Montana, while contributing to the quality of life for present and future generations.
