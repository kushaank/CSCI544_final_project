
PROVIDENCE — The Providence Journal’s Summertime Fund is now accepting donations to send children in need to camp this summer.

In 2013, 266 donors contributed $57,361, which gave 275 children from age 5 to 14 the chance to build friendships, learn life skills and experience the true joy of summer day camp. The fund has sent thousands of youngsters to camp since The Journal launched it in 1972.

“Once again, we ask you to help give hundreds of children the most memorable summer of their lives,” said Sutton.

The Journal provides print and online advertising space to promote the fund. Donors are recognized weekly in the Thursday edition of the newspaper and online at providencejournal.com/giving .

Administered by the Rhode Island Foundation , the Summertime Fund relies on donations from individuals — some made as family remembrances, or instead of personal gifts — as well as corporate contributions and community fundraisers.

A check or money-order donation payable to Providence Journal Summertime Fund may be mailed to the Rhode Island Foundation, One Union Station, Providence, RI 02903. Online donations can be made at providencejournal.com/giving .
