
Hey, isn’t that… “X-Men: Days of Future Past” star Patrick Stewart at Oyamel? Our tipsters tell us Sir Patrick, along with an unidentified man and woman, showed up at the Jose Andres Penn Quarter outpost around 7 p.m.   Saturday wearing a gray suit, purple shirt and no tie.

Earlier that day, Stewart, who plays “Professor X” in the Marvel Comics big screen franchise, was on hand to present collectibles from the film to the Smithsonian. The National Museum of American History can now count the costumes of mutant superheroes Professor Xavier, Magneto, Wolverine and Storm among its collection.

Currently in the midst of a whirlwind “X-Men” world tour, Stewart dropped into the District after scheduled stops in New York, London and Sao Pualo. The Twitter star (Stewart has more than 1.2 million followers) tweeted this about the publicity blitz for the film that opens on Friday.
