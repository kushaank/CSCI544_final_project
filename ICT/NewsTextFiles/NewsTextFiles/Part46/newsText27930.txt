
A subcommittee of the S.C. Commission on Higher Education has rejected a motion to provide a license to the InfiLaw System for the purchase of the Charleston School of Law .

On Friday, the Committee on Academic Affairs and Licensing held a public hearing in North Charleston to hear from community members about the future of the law school. Another public hearing was held this morning in West Columbia.

This afternoon, the committee met and agreed to recommend that the full commission deny licensure to InfiLaw, a for-profit consortium of independent law schools including the Charlotte School of Law, Florida Coastal School of Law and Arizona Summit Law School.

The committee will provide its negative recommendation to the full commission at its next meeting on June 5. The commission will then decide a final action, according to Julie Carullo, deputy director of the commission.

Ed Westbrook, one of the schoolâ€™s founders, said Friday he is willing to continue financially supporting the law school if InfiLaw does not receive licensing or American Bar Association approval.

Fellow founders Robert Carr and George Kosko are planning to retire soon, and both said Friday that they wanted InfiLaw to be granted licensure.
