
There has been a lot of confusion in the media lately regarding when and        how often a woman should get a mammogram to check for breast cancer. But        for older women, it’s simple: Women ages 50 to 74 should get a mammogram        at least every two yearsi, according to Dr. Richard Frank,        who serves as medical director for WellPoint’s affiliated Medicare        products. Even women 74 and older may want to continue getting a        mammogram every two years, depending on their health and doctor’s        recommendation.

Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, such as those affiliated with WellPoint,        frequently send reminders to their members about the importance of        getting a mammogram. Some even provide their members with a reward for        completing the screening.

Frank suggests women return to the same place, when possible, to get        their mammograms so current and past screenings can be compared.        Additionally, he said patients should let no more than 10 days pass        before following up with their doctors and should never assume results        are negative, just because they haven’t been contacted.

Although there are many reasons why a woman gets breast cancer,        including some outside of her control, Frank says certain lifestyle        changes can help reduce risk. He recommends women take the following        preventive actions.

Get exercise. Some MA plans include a free gym membership to        encourage exercise.

Keep a healthy weight, especially later in life. Local social        services organizations may be available for those who need help finding        nutritious meals. To check for these resources, visit www.benefitscheckup.org .

Limit alcohol. Medicare offers counseling to those who need help        to quit drinking.

Don’t smoke or quit if you do. A recent study by American Cancer        Society found that current smokers had a 12 percent higher risk of        breast cancer than women who never smoked. Medicare covers smoking        cessation products for those who need them.

Talk to a doctor. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Frank        reiterated how critical it is to talk to a doctor about getting regular        mammograms.

Anyone who is concerned about breast cancer, or who has symptoms, such        as a lump, swelling, redness or irritation, should contact their doctor.        For more information about breast cancer, visit www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/ .
