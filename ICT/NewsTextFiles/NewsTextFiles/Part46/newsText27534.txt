KIMT News 3 – Local north Iowa veterans are hoping to build a memorial in their hometown as a way to honor their area veterans.

Bertrum and Bernard Bidne are World War II, Korean War and Cold War veterans from Northwood.

After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, their father had one wish, and it changed their lives forever.

“Dad said to all five of his boys, it is my wish that all my five boys serve their country,” said Bertrum Bidne.

Following their father’s orders, the Bidne twins served for more than 20 years in the armed forces.

Today, after years of service, the 90-year-old twins hope to build a memorial to not only honor their father but, to also commemorate the memories of those who paid the ultimate sacrifice.

“We’ve lived here all our lives, except in the service and this means something to us. We’ve been raised with this canon. We got a picture of Dad after World War I sitting on that cannon,” said Bidne.

To help them in the process, Leon Christianson is organizing the effort to place a similar memorial for Worth County veterans.

“I’m a non-veteran. I’ve never served in the war. My brother did and my Dad did. It was very important to me to build a veterans monument here in Lake Mills so that no one will ever forget the veterans that have given us our freedom,” said Christianson.
