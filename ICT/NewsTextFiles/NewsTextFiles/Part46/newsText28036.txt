
NEW YORK ( MainStreet ) Â— While the cannabis business is hardly the most controversial industry to become legal in Nevada , it already seems to be one of the most popular.  The state legalized marijuana use for medicinal purposes in 2001, but it took another 12 years for state approval of legal dispensaries.   Brian Sandoval, state's Republican governor, signed the measure last June.

The first lottery for dispensary licenses just came to a close in Clark County in southern Nevada, the largest (albeit unincorporated) county in the state.  The lottery attracted 206 applications for medical marijuana businesses from 100 in-state and national enterprises and individuals before the final deadline in late April.  Applicants include those interested in establishing dispensaries, grow farms , production facilities and testing facilities.  There are only ten dispensary licenses available although currently no limit on cultivation or processing facilities.  All owners will also have to pass background checks. Clark County has to date two-thirds of the existing medical marijuana facilities in the state .

Winning license holders will also have to submit a non-refundable  $5,000 license processing fee and be well underway in the zoning process to finalize license approval.  While this may sound expensive if not onerous, it is cheap compared to similar proposals in Las Vegas for the same.  Per current guidelines now being drafted, successful Las Vegas applicants will have to pay over $100,000 in dispensary applications, approval and licensing fees and other costs associated with compliance (including security measures).

Clark County's early efforts, however, may set the tone for the state both in places where the industry flourishes and where it does not.  Two cities within Clark County (Henderson and Boulder City) have voted to ban medical marijuana sales altogether .
