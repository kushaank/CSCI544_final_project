
A Corning man crashed his motorcycle in Tehama county after allegedly leading officers on a chase around 9:30 p.m. Saturday night.

The California Highway Patrol said 22-year-old Sergio Barajas allegedly refused to stop when a Red Bluff CHP officer noticed him speeding on southbound I-5 just north of the Glenn County line.

According to the officer Barajas was going 94 mph.

When the officer attempted to pull him over Barajas continued to speed, reaching speeds of 118 mph.

He then exited I-5, taking exit 200 in Orland.

The CHP said at one point Barajas pulled over.

But as the officer was getting out of his patrol car to approach Barajas took off again.

The chase then continued westbound to Black Butte Road.

A half mile later Barajs lost control on turn, sending his bike into a barbed wire fence.

Barajas was ejected from the motorcycle.

He sustained moderate injuries and was arrested at St. Elizabeth's Hospital.
