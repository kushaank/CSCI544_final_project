
Were you planning on reading New York Magazine's seven-page profile on Chirlane McCray? Don't waste your time, when you can read the New York Post's totally not cherry-picked attempts to paint Bill DeBlasio's wife as a mother in the Betty Draper mold, starting off with a brilliant headline: "NYC's first lady: I was a bad mom."

Chiara was born in December 1994, seven months after the wedding, when Bill was working on Francisco Diaz's state assembly campaign. McCray had always imagined a life with children, but as with so many women the reality of motherhoodâ€”the loss of independence, the relentlessness of the responsibilityâ€”was difficult. "I was 40 years old. I had a life. Especially with Chiaraâ€”will we feel guilt forever more? Of course, yes. But the truth is, I could not spend every day with her. I didn't want to do that. I looked for all kinds of reason not to do it. I love her. I have thousands of photos of herâ€”every 1-month birthday, 2-month birthday. But I've been working since I was 14, and that part of me is me. It took a long time for me to get into 'I'm taking care of kids,' and what that means."

In a startlingly frank confession, Mayor Bill de Blasio's wife says she was unable to embrace motherhood and initially neglected Chiara, who last year dropped the bombshell that she was in treatment for abusing booze and pot .

The disclosure â€” bound to horrify most moms â€” shatters the carefully crafted image of de Blasio's close-knit family , which helped vault him into office.

Good job, Chirlane. Not only did your audacity to be overwhelmed by early motherhood fuck up your daughter for good, but you probably killed your husband's political career as well!

The article later concludes with a heee-larious attempt to pit McCray against Sheryl Sandberg. As always, stay classy, New York Post.
