Nine Oklahoma streams have been removed from the state list of impaired streams because of voluntary conservation practices, the Oklahoma Conservation Commission announced Monday.

Nine Oklahoma streams have been removed from the state impaired streams list because of voluntary conservation practices, the Oklahoma Conservation Commission announced Monday.

Streams are labeled impaired and placed on a list that is provided to the federal Environmental Protection Agency when those streams are polluted or have high turbidity, said Robert Hathorne, spokesman for the Oklahoma Conservation Commission. High turbidity means a large amount of sediment is suspended in the water.

The state has been able to lower the turbidity in these nine streams through conservation practices by farmers, ranchers and other landowners, officials said. Such practices include fencing off stream banks from livestock and not tilling fields in order to reduce chemical and soil runoff.

The streams being removed from the list this year are located in Bryan, Choctaw, Coal, Garfield, Grant, Kay, Logan, McIntosh, Osage and Pontotoc counties.

Maintaining conservation practices is particularly important in droughts because less frequent rainfall can harm water quality, officials said.

Oklahoma previously has succeeded in getting 37 other streams removed from the impaired list, the second best success rate in the nation.

The Oklahoma Conservation Commission monitors about 450 streams statewide on a five-year rotating basis.
