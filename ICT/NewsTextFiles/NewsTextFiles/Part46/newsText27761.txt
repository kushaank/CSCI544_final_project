
Embattled University of Texas System Regent Wallace L. Hall Jr. says he will not quit.

Paul Foster, chairman of the regents, urged Hall on Friday to step down amid a move in the state House to impeach him. A lawyer for Hall said his client told Foster in a letter Monday that he won’t resign.

A report by the House panel’s legal team, led by Rusty Hardin, a prominent Houston lawyer and former prosecutor, concluded that any one of four findings constitutes grounds for impeachment: Hall’s requests for massive amounts of records from the Austin campus, his handling of confidential student information, his actions toward UT-Austin President Bill Powers and other university officials and his advocacy before a national standards-setting group against the university’s position in a fundraising dispute.
