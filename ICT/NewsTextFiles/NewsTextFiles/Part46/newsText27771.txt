Republicans are the least pleased of all political parities with America's condition. Thirty-five percent of Democrats and 24 percent of Independents are satisfied with the direction of the country, compared to only 15 percent of Republicans.

The party's shifting optimism for America's future might correlate with the election season. A poll earlier this week, revealed Republicans show the most  voter enthusiasm . Perhaps, they are ready for change and see it as a possible reality in the near future.

About the same percent as those dissatisfied with Delaware's direction under the Democrats.

We need to turn our dissatisfaction to votes and dump these leeches.
