
Most Americans say it wouldn't matter to them whether a presidential candidate is gay, according to a new Pew Research Center poll , and the percentage who say it would make them less likely to vote for that candidate has dropped 19 points in the last seven years.

Sixty-six percent say they would not be any more or less likely to support a gay or lesbian presidential candidate -- up from 51 percent in 2007. About a quarter of Americans (27 percent) say they would be less likely to support a gay candidate. That percentage has declined from 46 percent in 2007 and 33 percent in 2011.

Only 5 percent of Americans say they would be more likely to vote for a candidate because the candidate is gay.
