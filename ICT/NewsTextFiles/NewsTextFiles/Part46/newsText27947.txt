
ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia Senate candidate Michelle Nunn is refusing to say whether she would have voted for President Barack Obama's signature health care law in a race that could help determine congressional control.

Nunn was asked by The Associated Press Monday why she would not answer the question, initially posed by NBC News. Nunn said she plans on — quote — "continuing to answer the question by talking about where we need to go in the future and how we need to move forward."

Nunn has been critical of some aspects of the law, while praising others. She has said the focus should be on fixing the law, not repealing it.

Republicans must gain six seats to win the majority and have tried to make the midterm elections a referendum on "Obamacare."

Nunn is expected to advance in Tuesday's primary against three Democratic opponents.
