CLEVELAND, Ohio – A water main break in the Flats Monday morning has left some bars and residents in the area without water.

An 8-inch main running beneath the 2200 block of Elm Avenue fractured about 8 a.m., said Cleveland Water spokesman John Goersmeyer.

A pair of nearby bars -- Harbor Inn and McCarthy's –- and The Apartments at Nautica will be without water while crews make repairs, Goersmeyer said.

Hundreds of gallons of water bubbled onto Elm Avenue -- some seeping into Harbor Inn -- by the time workers shut off the flow. Three cars were towed from the street so crews could tear up pavement and access the pipe.

Crews are working to determine the extent of the damage.
