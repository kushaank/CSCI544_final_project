
A new report suggests that the US state of Pennsylvania could be the ideal location for online poker.

The study commissioned by the state's Legislative Budget and Finance Committee (LBFC) estimated that revenue from online poker could reach $129 million per year, with a total of $170 million being generated if other internet casino games were permitted.

Such predictions could play a key role in ongoing debates about whether Pennsylvania will opt to back online poker gaming like fellow states New Jersey, Nevada and Delaware.

The report also stressed that the allowing of internet gaming may not have a significant impact on traditional land-based casinos because they attract different players.

"So long as Pennsylvania casinos are able to market to iGaming players, and so long as the player data is available through these partnerships, then the allocation of profits to operators will not affect the state's interests."
