The incident occurred in the 700 block of Canal Street and police said they believe it may have had something to do with a social media set of posts that stated merely – CANAL DAY 4 pm until, Saturday May 17, 2014.

Police said a fight broke out inside of a McDonald’s at that location and that the restaurant asked those involved to leave. The fight then continued outside and some of it was caught on video.
