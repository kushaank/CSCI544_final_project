
A cold frontal boundary will continue to slide eastward over the Great Basin, the Intermountain West and the Plains on Monday, while an area of low pressure is expected to linger along the coast of New England.

A cold frontal boundary will extend from southern Nevada to North Dakota on Monday, bringing a chance of thunderstorms to a handful of states. A warm, muggy air mass is expected to surge northward ahead of this system, which will initiate showers and thunderstorms over the upper Midwest, the northern Plains and the upper Intermountain West. Parts of the West Coast, including northern California, northwest Nevada and Oregon, will also have a slight chance of showers and thunderstorms. Meanwhile, an onshore flow from the Pacific will bring rainy weather to Washington and northwest Oregon. High pressure will keep conditions mostly clear across the Desert Southwest.
