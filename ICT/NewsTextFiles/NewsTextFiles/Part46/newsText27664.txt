
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) â€” State Sen. Dan Patrick has reported raising more than $4 million in the past two months as he tries unseating Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst in next week's GOP primary runoff.

The tea party favorite from Houston said Monday that total only encompass contributions between Feb. 23 and this past weekend.

Patrick reported spending $3.75 million on statewide media advertising and says he has $400,000 in cash on-hand remaining before the May 27 election. Early voting began Monday.

Dewhurst's latest fundraising report was also due Monday. He wants a fourth and final term in the powerful Texas office and has spent from his own personal fortune in previous campaigns.

The primary winner faces Democratic state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte in November.
