
Kids these days are always texting, and by kids we mean Maine’s senators.

At a joint event on May 16 at the home of Margaret Chase Smith in which independent Angus King announced his endorsement of his Republican Susan Collins’ re-election bid, King said the pair traded messages about the endorsement that morning.

Collins, of course, welcomed the endorsement.

“In all seriousness, I am truly delighted to be here today at the home of the legendary Margaret Chase Smith, who was such an inspiration to all of us who serve to represent Maine in the United States Senate,” Collins said.

ITS NOT A SURPRISED THAT PEOPLE ARE BEGINING TO VOICE THEIR ANGER AT THE REPUBLICAN SENATE, AND AT SENATOR JOHN BOEHNER IN PARTICULAR, FOR THEIR TOTAL FAILURE TO DO THE “RIGHT & MORAL” THING, AND PASS THE UNEMPLOYMENT EXTENSION BILL FOR THESE 2.6 MILLION UNEMPLOYED FAMILIES WITHOUT BENEFITS. SINCE LATE LAST DECEMBER, THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN HOLDING THE EXTENSION BILL “HOSTAGE” IN THE SENATE FOR POLITICAL LEVERAGE. THEY HAVE MADE DELAY AFTER DELAY, DRAGGING THEIR FEET, WHILE FAMILLIES WERE BEING DESTROYED FINANCIALLY, MANY BECOMING HOMELESS IN THE PROCESS. THE REPUBLICANS HAVE USED THESE FAMILIES AS BARGAINING CHIPS, IN ORDER TO GET THE KOCH BROTHER’S OIL PIPE LINE APPROVED IN RETURN. THEY DON’T CARE ABOUT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN WORKER, THEY GIVE THEIR LOYALITY TO THE UPPER ONE PERCENT IN THE COUNTRY, NOT TO THE 99 PERCENT WHO DO MOST OF THE WORKING AND TAX PAYING. I’M SURPTEISED THAT PEOPLE HAVEN’T STARTED PROTESTING IN THE STREET ABOUT THIS. I KNOW THAT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE WASTED ONY CHANCE OF WINNING THE NEXT ELECTIONS BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE.
