In September, a reporter and photographer from AL.com were included on a tour. The Alabama Department of Corrections denied requests by AL.com and WBHM to tour the facility Friday with broadcast media outlets Fox 6 WBRC and Alabama News Network.

According to a report from Fox 6 reporter Beth Shelburne, Tutwiler remains "horribly overcrowded," but she noticed some improvements, such as 300 newly installed cameras and privacy curtains in the showers.
