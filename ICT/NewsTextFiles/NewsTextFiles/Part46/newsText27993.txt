
A group of activists made Vallejo a pit stop Saturday night as they embarked on a 130-mile peace march to protest against drone attacks abroad by the United States government.

"We're really tired. It's frustrating and sickening to have so many innocent people killed in drone attacks," protester Devan Phenix said in a phone interview as the group is walking out of Vallejo on its way to Fairfield.

The group, which identifies itself as the Occupy Beale Air Force Base, began their journey Saturday morning at San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge to the ferry terminal to take a ferry out to Vallejo.

The goal is to reach Sacramento on Saturday to join a protest against the controversial agricultural company Monsanto, and make their way to the Beale Air Force Base near Marysville, Phenix said.

After staying the night in Vallejo, the activists continued their walk along Tuloumne Street, Valle Vista Avenue, Redwood Parkway and Admiral Callaghan Lane to raise awareness on the issue.

"Not doing anything definitely won't make any difference, that I know," Phenix, of Grass Valley, said. "We're trying to bring (the drone attacks) into attention."

The march also symbolizes their solidarity with the families who have been affected by the attacks, he said.

"I'm a father, and I can't imagine losing my daughter to something like this," Phenix said.

The group, which fluctuates in number as it makes the journey, consists of people from all over Northern California. Once they arrive at the base, there will be a protest and vigil at the main gate.

Although this is the group's first peace march, Phenix said they have been protesting regularly at the base.
