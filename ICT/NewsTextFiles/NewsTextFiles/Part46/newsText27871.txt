HOOVER, Alabama - A woman crashed her vehicle into a window at the Hoover Public Library today, but there were no injuries, police and fire officials said.

The vehicle came from a parking space outside the library, went through some bushes and down a small embankment and crashed into a window in the nonfiction section of the library. Neither the driver, who was in her mid-40s, nor anyone inside the library was injured, Hoover police Capt. Jim Coker said.

Details on what caused the accident to happen were not available.

City workers boarded up the broken window and have blocked library patrons from entering the part of the nonfiction area where the incident occurred.

The library has no plans for drive-through service.
