
GALESBURG � With a shout, Maddux Harroun pulled a channel catfish longer than his arm out of the water.

Maddux, along with his stepdad Rory Kivisto, mom Shawna Kivisto and brother Austin Carter, all of Galesburg, were enjoying the 27th annual Galesburg Youth Fishing Derby at the Lincoln Park Lagoons Sunday afternoon. Some 600 children were registered, bringing the estimated total to well over 1,000, a number Youth Fishing Derby Chairman Sue Dutell was very pleased with.

�The big fish are really coming out of the lake like crazy,� Dutell said with a smile.

As Dutell explained, what draws the crowd is three things: the fish, the prizes and the family.

Many of the fish were transported from the Mississippi River by the Illinois Department of Conservation courtesy of Ken Russell, district fishery biologist.

The prizes consisted of Red Ryder BB guns, fishing poles, sleeping bags and archery sets � mostly outdoor goods. Each child received a ticket for showing up and once they caught a fish, they could return the ticket for a prize.

The biggest reason for attending, as Dutell said, was being around family.

The event started at 1 p.m., but by 1:45 p.m. all 400 prizes had been claimed � not that it mattered. Families stayed long after the prizes were gone.

Next to the covered shelter, Kimm Elgin was fishing with her husband, Bill Elgin, and two children, 10-year-old Billy and 7-year-old Sabrina Elgin.

�I�ve been fishing since I was old enough to hold a fishing pole,� Kimm said. �And I think he has too,� she said, pointing to her husband.

Part of the thrill for Billy and Sabrina was the competition.

As Bill explained, the Youth Fishing Derby has become a tradition for the family.

Back at Maddux and his family�s fishing spot, another catfish was biting.

The fish managed to get away.

While putting bait on Maddux�s hook, Rory told him that his dad was going to have the big catfish he caught taxidermied.

�You�re gonna have that the rest of your life,� he said.

�I can�t believe this!� Maddux said, again jumping up and down.
