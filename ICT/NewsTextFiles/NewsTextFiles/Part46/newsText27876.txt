
BATON ROUGE, La. (KNOE 8 News/SOS Communications Office) — Visitors to the Louisiana State Archives will have a chance to view a collection of iconic Blue Dog artwork by acclaimed Louisiana artist George Rodrigue beginning Tuesday, May 20, 2014 and running through Monday, June 30, 2014. The month long exhibit will include several original Rodrigue paintings.

"My family and I are excited to have the opportunity to display Dad's work in Baton Rouge again,” said Jacques Rodrigue, Executive Director of the George Rodrigue Foundation of the Arts. “Exhibits like this help further the arts in education initiatives of our foundation and we hope students in the area are able to take advantage of the chance to see original Rodrigue work. It will likely be many years before the Baton Rouge area will have the chance to see a collection of paintings like this again."

As part of its outreach activities for the Blue Dog exhibit, the Archives will host Miss USA, Miss Louisiana and several of the 2014 Miss USA contestants on Thursday, May 29th in cooperation with Visit Baton Rouge as a part of their pageant activities. The private event, which is open to members of the media, will begin at 2:00 pm and conclude at 3:00 p.m.

For the event on the 29th, the “Blue Dog Piano” will also be on display. The one-of-a-kind restored Steinway piano was used by Rodrigue as a canvas to generate interest for his George Rodrigue Foundation of the Arts.

Harold Mims, a PhD student at Louisiana State University studying music composition and jazz studies has graciously agreed to play the Blue Dog Steinway for the Miss USA contestants. He is founder of HCM Music & Publishing and services clients as an arranger, composer, orchestrator, keyboardist, educator and producer. Additionally, LSU School of Music Brass students will also be performing during the ceremony.
