
Three people died in a head-on collision in Choctaw on Monday.

The crash happened around 1:00 p.m.

The Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office said the initial investigation indicated that Gene Pruett was driving a vehicle westbound on NE 23rd Street and crossed the center line.

Pruett, 80, and his wife Deloris Pruett, 70, both died as a result of the crash. The driver of the other vehicle, Chad Condrey, 40, also died as a result of the crash. One passenger, Tyler Condrey, 20, was taken to an area hospital in critical condition.

Investigators are still working to determine what caused Pruett to cross the center line.
