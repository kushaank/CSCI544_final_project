
In politics, money talks and pretty much everything else walks.

Meet Tom Wolf. My guess is sometime Tuesday night he will stride to a microphone and declare victory in the Pennsylvania Democratic gubernatorial election.

If you�re asking, �Who is Tom Wolf?� you haven�t been paying attention.

Which is funny, because if you had said the same thing just a few months ago, no one would have batted an eye.

Amazing what $10 million buys you these days.

For Wolf, it bought the York businessman a slick avalanche of TV ads that propelled him to an insurmountable lead among the bevy of Democrats seeking to tangle with what most experts believe is an extremely vulnerable incumbent Republican Gov. Tom Corbett.

Ever since his ads saturated the state, Wolf has been looking in the rearview mirror of that cute little Jeep that co-stars with him in all those ads, seeing the pack of Democratic counterparts choking on his exhaust.

For some reason, Allyson Schwartz waited forever to get out of the blocks, perhaps numbed by an attack from within her own party over her ties to a group that raised the hackles of some supporters. By the time she got energized, the race was all but over.

Pretty much the same goes for Rob McCord, the state treasurer who wants to raise big bucks by slapping a whopping 10 percent tax on Marcellus Shale drilling.

Katie McGinty? You get bonus points if you know that she was a former boss at the state Department of Environmental Protection. She has stayed pretty much out of the fray as McCord and Schwartz have gone on the attack in attempts to derail Wolf. And she has the poll numbers to prove it.

On Wednesday morning, Delaware County will wake up to the main event: Wolf versus Corbett.

On the undercard will be the state Senate race that will pit Republican Tom McGarrigle, the popular chairman of Delaware County Council, versus Democrat John Kane, a labor leader from Ridley Township, to replace the venerable Sen. Ted Erickson in the 26th District. Kane has been doing his best Schwartz impersonation, largely staying out of the news until last weekend, while McGarrigle continues to pop up regularly in his role as the leader of county council. Yes, that was Tom Terrific front and center announcing that deal to save all those homes and businesses while still allowing for the much-needed expansion of Philadelphia International Airport.

Perhaps the most interesting race on tomorrow�s ballot � at least as far as Delaware County�s new majority Democrats are concerned � is the increasingly bitter challenge to incumbent state Rep. Margo Davidson in the 164th District in Upper Darby.

She�s rubbed people the wrong way with her support for school choice and restrictions on abortion clinics, and is getting all she can handle from challengers Billy Smith and Dafan Zhang.

Eventually, one of them will emerge and run in the fall against Republican Saud Siddiqui. Despite the best efforts of Smith, who has unleashed a nasty campaign on Davidson, the smart guess here is that she prevails.

Also interesting, if not tomorrow, will be the fall matchup to replace an Upper Darby icon in Harrisburg. Republican township Councilman Jamie Santora will face off against Democrat Vince Rongione to replace Rep. Nick Micozzie in the 163rd District. It will be the first time in more than three decades that Micozzie will not be looking after the best interests of Upper Darby � and Delco � in Harrisburg. And it marks a complete changing of the guard in the Upper Darby delegation in the state Capitol. Rep. Mario Civera saw the changing demographic writing on the wall and exited a few years back. The seat then went Democratic with Davidson�s win. Now she finds herself being challenged � from within her own party.

The real sin tomorrow will not be who will win, but how few people will make the decision.

This is an off-year primary. In other words, dullsville. Without a presidential vote to lure voters to the polls, most of the state likely will take a powder on exercising their franchise. Even with Democrats slugging it out for the chance to topple Corbett, I�m guessing turnout will be hard-pressed to break 15 percent.

Oh, and one other thing. Remember, money talks. That�s why I say Wolf wins tomorrow.

That won�t be a problem for Corbett. Call me a fool, but remember where you heard it. Corbett gets re-elected in November. If there�s one thing this state does consistently it�s re-elect incumbent governors for a second term. Expect to see Corbett in Delaware County and the Philly suburbs constantly through the fall. He might event want to stop by and say hello to his buddy McGarrigle. They can chat about their differences when it comes to taxing Marcellus Shale. McGarrigle wants a 4 percent levy, with all the money going to education. Corbett believes all this talk of new levies on a burgeoning business is anathema.

Expect Delco Republicans to be beating the �Tom-Tom� for months. I don�t see Corbett being derailed by a lone Wolf.
