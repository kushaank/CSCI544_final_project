Officials at Sacred Heart Cathedral in San Francisco have apologized for excluding a senior girl's photo from the yearbook because she wore a tuxedo.

Last Friday, fellow students made a fashion statement and wore neckties to show solidarity with Jessica Urbina.

On Monday, the principal released an apology letter on the school's website and offered to reprint all yearbooks.

However, Jessica's family doesn't want to delay their release and says they'll find another way to include her portrait.

Jessica's picture will be displayed Saturday at graduation. And, administrators will consider a new dress code policy for senior portraits.
