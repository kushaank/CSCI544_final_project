
Milpitas, California – Network storage expert Thecus will be at COMPUTEX 2014 in Taipei, Taiwan, from June 3 to June 7. Thecus invites all interested parties to visit their booth (J0617 in Nangang Exhibition Hall 1F) to get a first-hand look at some of its latest offerings and technology.

Visitors will not want to miss out on Thecus's two live demos - one for enterprise and one for home. Headlining the enterprise demo will be Thecus's new Daisy Chaining technology, which will combine the capacities of 80 drives. This cost-efficient set-up can theoretically, in conjunction with Volume Expansion, provide up to 3.8 petabytes of network storage, roughly the equivalent of 900,000 DVDs.

The home demo, meanwhile, will showcase Thecus's T-OnTheGo app, which enables data transfers to and from mobile devices, as well as new HTPC features for home NAS.

Guests will be able to get a hands-on preview of Thecus's new 4-bay NAS model before it hits markets later this year. In addition to this new model, a diverse range of products will be on display, including enterprise solutions such as the, N12000PRO, N16000PRO, and D16000, as well as home/SOHO NAS like the N2310 and N2560. Something of a rarity in the enterprise cloud market, the 10GbE-powered N7710-G and N8810-G will also be present to tempt visitors into tomorrow's networking world.

Further on exhibit will be Thecus's network video recording (NVR) line and its custom management software, VisoGuard.
