
Jean-Paul Mandeville, left, and his wife, Stephanie, deliver diapers to the Rhode Island Community Food Bank Monday morning. Stephanie, of Cranston, went into action after reading a story in last Mondayâ€™s Providence Journal, which reported that diapers are not subsidized or covered by the Women, Infants and Children supplemental nutrition program. Upset, Stephanie sent emails to friends, family and colleagues and posted on Facebook and Twitter looking for diaper donations. She got immediate responses from all over Rhode Island. Stephanie and Jean-Paul offered to pick up the diapers, but many people insisted in dropping them off at their house. In all, 16,795 diapers were donated, as well as some wipes and formula. The man at right is Bruce Zarembka, director of procurement for the Food Bank.
