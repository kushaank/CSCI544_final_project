
Considered the vocal leader of the Seahawks' wide receivers during his first three seasons in Seattle, Sidney Rice apparently hasn't relinquished the role now that he's no longer atop the position's pecking order.

That much was evident when rookie Paul Richardson joined 710 ESPN Seattle's "Wyman, Mike and Moore" and mentioned Rice first when the conversation turned to his fellow receivers.

"Sidney is the head honcho here," Richardson said.

Seattle gave Rice a top-shelf contract in 2011, signing him to a free-agent deal that averaged $8.2 million a year and made him one of the team's highest-paid players. Since then Seattle has given Percy Harvin the biggest contract in franchise history, spent a top pick on Richardson and released Rice before bringing him back on a $1.4 million deal.

He'll now compete for a spot at what looks like it could be the most competitive position on Seattle's roster. And Rice is no lock to earn one as he's coming off a torn ACL that sidelined him for the second half of last season.

But while Rice's standing in the organization may have changed, it doesn't sound like he's taking a back seat in Seattle's receiver corps.
