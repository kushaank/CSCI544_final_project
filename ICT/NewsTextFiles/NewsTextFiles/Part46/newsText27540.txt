
The last wooden whaleship in the world has left Mystic Seaport for its 38th voyage and three-month journey around New England.

That is, until Saturday, May 17, when it departed down the Mystic River cheered on by crowds of spectators.

Among the ship's scheduled stops are Fort Adams State Park in Newport on June 17, and State Pier in New Bedford from June 28-July 6.
