
Dr. Paolo Casali , with the School of Medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, is one of six recipients of a grant from the Alliance for Lupus Research.

Casaliâ€™s three-year, $600,000 grant will be used to study the impact of drugs called epigenetic modulators on lupus.

Systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE, is an autoimmune disease that debilitates as many as 1.5 million Americans â€” mostly women who are in their fertile years. Some scientists believe that epigenetic modulators, often used in the treatment of lymphomas, could be useful therapies for lupus as well.

Casali has contributed to fundamental understandings about immune system abnormalities that occur in SLE. These findings provide a scientific rationale for why epigenetic modulators might be effective in humans.

The Alliance for Lupus Research grant will identify novel targets for new lupus therapeutics.

â€œOur team of investigators has conducted basic science research that has found an immediate translational relevance to a disease, lupus,â€� Casali explains. â€œFor the first time, mechanisms important to the generation of autoantibodies (the antibodies that attack components of the body) have been identified. We outlined the mechanisms and then looked for drugs that may alter them.

â€œWe will systematically test the ability of different epigenetic modulators to blunt the lupus autoantibody response and prevent (or) cure the disease,â€� Casali adds.

The Alliance for Lupus Research funding complements and expands the scope of two additional and larger National Institutes of Health research grants Casali has already received in support of his research.
