
SAN FRANCISCO & PLEASANTON, Calif.--( BUSINESS WIRE )-- ManageEngine ,        the real-time IT management company, today announced the general        availability of the Fluidic, the new web client for its network and data        center infrastructure management (DCIM) software, OpManager .        The new web client is built on APIs and the JavaScript        model-view-controller (MVC) platform called Ember.js to help admins get        their jobs done faster. The Fluidic also includes several enhancements        such as a social wall for IT to simplify collaboration with colleagues        using OpManager.

ManageEngine is demonstrating the new features of OpManager at Cisco        Live 2014 being held May 18-22, 2014, at Moscone Center in San        Francisco. A silver sponsor of the event, ManageEngine is in booth 2205.

Productivity in IT is decided by the IT management solution and the        communication platform used by the IT team. The web client of legacy IT        management solutions not only offers a poor user experience but is also        extremely slow. Even fixing a simple problem is unproductive and time        consuming as the IT admin has to navigate across multiple pages and        coordinate with various teams.

With OpManager’s Fluidic web client, IT admins and data center admins        can navigate across various performance dashboards, monitors, graphs and        reports in just a few milliseconds. The Fluidic, combined with social IT        for real-time collaboration among IT folks, improves IT productivity of        large enterprises and data centers.

Today, enterprises handle 10 times more alarms than they did a decade        ago. At $70,000 a year, a systems administrator costs $35 per hour. A        10-member IT team could save $875,000 over 5 years if the user interface        for their IT management solution was 25 percent faster. The faster UI        would also let them complete their work 25 percent faster, so a task        that would typically take eight hours would be completed two hours        earlier using the faster UI.

In addition to the Fluidic UI and social wall for IT, OpManager 11.3        enhancements include a custom report builder, a heat map widget with        live health status of devices, multi-color graphs built on rickshaw.js,        HTML5-based workflow, rack and floor builders, QR codes for asset        tracking built on qrcode.js, and support for keyboard shortcuts built on        keboard.js.
