
In Kansas City, a small startup called DivvyHQ is quietly signing on new customers. Maybe you’ve heard their names? They’re companies like Walmart, Sprint, Toyota, and Bed Bath and Beyond.

“We’ve been very fortunate in that we built a product at the right time – we built a product that was first of our kind in a new, quickly emerging market, and it filled a big gap,” says Stechman.

“We’ve been able to build ourselves into a household name within our industry,” says Stechman. “I don’t want to sound nonchalant, it’s been extremely hard work.” In other words, a lot of hustling, with only one salesperson on staff to date.

Walmart, for example, found out about DivvyHQ from a blog post. Sprint found out about them at an event, and TomTom found them by searching Google.

“It’s a very close and tight-knit community, and I think that stems from the Midwest values of everybody is here to genuinely help everybody else out,” says Stechman.
