Belk will close its store at the Four Seasons Town Centre in Greensboro in February 2015, a company spokesperson said Monday.

"In our ongoing efforts to better serve and meet the shopping needs of our customers in Greensboro and the greater Triad market for the long term, we have decided to close our Belk store at Four Seasons Mall in February 2015 and focus our resources and efforts on the major expansion and remodeling of our Friendly Center store, which we will reopen this fall as a Belk flagship store," said Jessica Graham , Belk spokesperson, in an email message on Monday.

As part of its long-term strategic push to update its image, Belk recently opened a $7 million, 75,000-square-foot store at the Palladium at Deep River Shopping Center in High Point. It had previously operated a location at High Point's Oak Hollow Mall.

Construction is underway on Belk's expanded home goods location at 604 Green Valley Road across from the Friendly Center. As Graham's email said, the Belk store inside the Friendly Center is being remodeled into a flagship store.

Belk's Four Seasons location had 58 employees, who will be able to apply for available positions at the Friendly Center location and other Belk stores, the News & Record reported .
