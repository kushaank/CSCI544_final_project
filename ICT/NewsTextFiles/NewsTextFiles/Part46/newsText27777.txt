Iowa Republicans favor preserving "traditional" marriage as a plank in the party platform by a large margin, according to polling released Monday.

A poll of likely Republican primary voters conducted earlier this month by Loras College found 61.7 percent favor defining marriage within the party platform as between one man and one woman, as it currently is.

Less than a quarter of respondents – 23.3 percent – said the party should endorse no government role in marriage, while 10.3 percent favored including in the platform acceptance of current Iowa law, which allows same-sex marriage under the 2009 Varnum v. Brien Supreme Court decision.

Republicans have long opposed same-sex marriage and supported policies – including state law and constitutional amendments – mandating that marriage be only between a man and a woman.

In the party's 1st District convention last month, though, delegates approved rewriting the marriage plank to say government should not be involved in such matters.

Loras College Political Scientist Christopher Budzisz said the poll result shows Iowa Republicans as a whole aren't prepared to abandon opposition to same-sex marriage as a core belief of the party.

"While it might not play a major role in the upcoming general election campaign, within the party there remains strong opposition to current Iowa law," Budzisz said in a statement accompanying the poll results.

The Loras College Poll surveyed 600 likely Iowa Republican primary voters statewide, and had a 4-percent margin of error.
