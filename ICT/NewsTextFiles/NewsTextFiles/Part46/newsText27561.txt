Buffalo Treehouse is taking Western New Yorkers 12 feet in the air thanks to some tree topping creations that are all made in WNY.

The local company designs and builds custom treehouses for customers across the area.

Thanks to a background in carpentry and landscape design, with a lot of creativity, Ricardo Rivera founded Buffalo Treehouse in 2009. It took awhile for the business to catch on, but he says demand is now growing. Riveraâ€™s wife Jyl helps him run the business, while their children test out and approve each idea.

But treehouses are not just for children. In fact, people pay top dollar for one of Buffalo Treehouseâ€™s custom designs like the Cottonwood Cabin in East Amherst.

That included building right around two cottonwood trees, preserving saplings as balusters and adding benches that pull out into cots for a sleepover.

And a treehouse can add to a homeâ€™s resale value. The original owner of the Cottonwood Cabin was transferred out of town for work. The treehouse turned out to be the selling point to buyers who were transferred here from Ireland.
