
ESPN.com News Services - California Chrome has been given approval to wear a nasal strip during the 146th Belmont Stakes, keeping alive the horse's chance of becoming the sport's 12th Triple Crown winner.

The New York Racing Association stewards, after consultation with New York State Gaming Commission equine medical director Scott Palmer, on Monday unanimously approved the use of equine nasal strips at all NYRA racetracks, effective immediately.

California Chrome will be allowed to wear the strip during the 1Â½-mile race on June 7. It's the longest and most grueling of the three Triple Crown races.

Trainer Art Sherman, who contacted the stewards on Sunday to make the formal request, had suggested that California Chrome might not race in the Belmont without the strip, which he wore during victories in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes.

"I recommend that the stewards at state-based thoroughbred racetracks discontinue their ban on equine nasal strips," Palmer wrote. "Equine nasal strips do not enhance equine performance nor do they pose a risk to equine health or safety and as such do not need to be regulated.
