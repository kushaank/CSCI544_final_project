
Sen. John Hoeven and Gov. Jack Dalrymple were in Tioga today to celebrate the expansion of the Hess Gas Plant.

The project is part of a more than $1.5 billion infrastructure investment. The process of expanding the plant took two years to finish, but now the production can go from 120 million cubic feet of natural gas per day to 250 million. Officials say going 300 million shouldn't be program at some point. It will also allow an increase in production of propane, methane, butane and ethane.

There is no timetable for when the production of 250 million cubic feet of natural gas per day will start, but officials say maybe in a couple years.
