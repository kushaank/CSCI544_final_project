
Three years of turmoil with three prime ministers having shown the door has brought things to a head-on collision in Libya.

The worst to come is in the form of a no-fly zone that was imposed by the army over Benghazi, as militants continue to fight pitched battles with the security forces. Since Colonel Muammar Gadaffi was overthrown, Libya has gone from worse to worst, and the writ of the government has been lacking. At times it seems to be a field day for the militants as they are free to sell the oil in international market as well as abduct the prime minister on their own! This state of affairs is not only unravelling the North African country but also enabling the tendency of militancy to explode beyond its borders.

With more than 50 people killed and hundreds injured in a latest clash between the military and the rebels, Benghazi is once in trouble. Libya’s second largest city was home to some of the worst upheaval as militants ransacked the US consulate in 2012 and killed its envoy and four other diplomats. This no-fly zone is one of the unique of its kind where in the state army is engaged against a paramilitary group that has laid its hands on aircraft, and is capable enough to fly its own sorties. This unnerving news incidentally comes in the wake of coup rumours by a deserted colonel of army.

It is no less than a tragedy for one of the prosperous and resource-rich African-Arab country to experience a web of militants among its midst and members of civil and military bureaucracy defecting to rebel groups. This civil war in Libya is a precursor for disaster, and something serious is in need of being done to save the country from going over the brink.
