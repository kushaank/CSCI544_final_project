
Update (5/19 12:00pm) U.S. District Judge Micheal McShane has overturned Oregon's same sex marriage ban, calling it unconstitutional.

Ashland, Ore. --  A historic ruling will come down Monday for same-sex couples in Oregon. A federal judge will make a decision that could overturn the state ban and make same-sex marriages legal.

The ruling is expected to be announced at noon Monday.

Oregon's Attorney General and Governor John Kitzhaber have both refused to defend the state's gay marriage ban, which is why a federal judge is now making a decision.

One couple from Ashland says it's time for equality for all.

"We want it to be solid and so that it's not rejected. I  look forward to that when I can say wife and it's legal," said Gina DuQuenne.

If the judge overturns the ban, state officials have said that same-sex marriages could begin immediately.

Opponents however said they will appeal.
