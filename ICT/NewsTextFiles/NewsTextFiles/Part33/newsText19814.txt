
The situation in Haiti is, in one word, “deplorable” according to one man that tries to make it a little bit better.

Dr. John Carroll is an internist from Peoria, Illinois who for the past number of years, spends two to four months a year in Haiti, working in the country’s clinics and hospitals with the NGO, Haitian Hearts .

I got the opportunity to talk to John about his “boots on the ground” view of the situation in Haiti ( Listen below) .

Concerning the newly arrived chikungunya, Dr. Carroll says, “I think it [Haiti] is completely ripe for a massive epidemic of chikungunya”. Rainy season, a bountiful of mosquito breeding sites and a very poor sanitation system would all contribute to this.

Cholera, as one would expect after nearly 3 1/2 years, is not nearly as bad as 2010 and 2011 when Carroll said he was treating 300 cases per day.

What other problems does Carroll see on a regular basis? Respiratory diseases in kids, a lot of vomiting and diarrhea, skin diseases, typhoid fever, hepatitis and a whole lot of TB. For more infectious disease news and information,  visit and “like” the Infectious Disease News Facebook page .

If anyone is interested in helping the great work of Haitian Hearts, you can visit their website at  www.haitianhearts.org . Dr Carroll said their biggest need is pediatric cardiovascular medical centers with administration who are open to operating on a Haitian child.
