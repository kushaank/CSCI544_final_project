
THE RESIDENTS of the Geriatric Hospital were treated to a heart-warming day of song and praise yesterday as the Association of Friends of the Geriatric Hospital held its annual harvest thanksgiving ceremony.

Various church groups performed for the elderly patients, some of whom joined in the singing.

It was also an opportunity for family members to visit with their loved ones and interact with hospital staff.

Association president Cynthia Boyce said they had been giving back to the hospital for more than 20 years, contributing medical equipment and furniture.
