
DIGHTON â€” Wednesday's Board of Selectmen meeting was a time for celebration.

The board had a ceremony for retiring firefighter and emergency medical technician Neil Horton.

Horton was awarded with citations from state Sen. Marc Pacheco, state Rep. Patricia Haddad and the Board of Selectmen, as well as the fire chief, members of his department and other locals.

The board's meeting room was practically standing-room only to pay tribute to Horton, who will hang up his firefighter's helmet after 31 years of service.

Looking at the packed crowd, Horton shared many laughs and confessed that he struggled to "hold back the tears."

He said firefighting can be difficult work, especially when his wife would always tell him to "be safe" before he left for work each day.

"I did my job and I came home, and now I am home for good," he said.

Still, he had many great words to say about the job and the town. He was bestowed with gifts, such as a fire hatchet resembling the department's insignia and even a bathroom brush from fellow fire Lt. Chris Ready. The latter honored Horton's love of cleaning the fire station.

Selectmen on Wednesday also filled two committees that they say will help spur economic development in town. They appointed Steven Dumenigo and Pam Wailler to the Industrial Development Finance Committee. They had the committee organize and name Brian Brown as chairman and Wailler as clerk.

"For many years, a void has existed for this need," Selectman Patrick Menges said, adding, "This is the moment at which a committee can foster commerce and an invitation of industry for this town."

Selectmen also completed the membership of the Capital Outlay Committee, naming Jeffrey Cloonan and Brenda Moyniham to committee posts.
