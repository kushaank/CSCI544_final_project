
BERIUT: The Telecommunications Ministry dismissed media reports about the new rates for phone calls and Internet data, saying it would provide the official rates later this week.

“Some of the reports circulated by media institutions and websites about lowering the rates for phone calls and Internet data are not accurate,” the ministry said in a statement. “The new rates go into effect on the first of June and not today [Monday] as some media reports said."

Telecommunications Minister Boutros Harb will unveil the new telecom rates at a press conference Friday, the statement said.
