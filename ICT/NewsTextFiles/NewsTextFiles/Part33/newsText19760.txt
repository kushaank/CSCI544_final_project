
Awareness teams from the Elections Office will hit the ground running from next month.

Elections Supervisor Mohammed Saneem says their education material almost ready.

He adds the awareness campaigns in Fijian communities will be multi-faceted.

“There’s 4 phases of voter education, starts with when to vote, where to vote, how to vote and all Fijians should vote."

In that, the teams we are currently recruiting will be going out towards the later part of next month.

The Elections office has received $7 million from the PNG government – parts of the grant promised to assist Fiji with the polling.

There are one hundred and nineteen days left before the election.
