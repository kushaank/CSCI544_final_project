
A section of Cedar Lane in Bethesda is expected to close for construction sometime around June 6.

The work is part of a slate of road projects in the area designed to ease traffic around the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda. The area has seen an influx of commuters since the Pentagon’s Base Realignment and Closure program brought more workers to the center. That program closed the Walter Reed Army hospital in Washington, D.C., and consolidated its operations with the naval hospital in Bethesda.

Phil Alperson, who coordinates Montgomery County’s BRAC-related programs, said in an email that 1,000 feet of the road is planned to close between Rockville Pike and Elmhirst Parkway to the east.

The intersection of Rockville Pike and Cedar Lane has been rated the most congested in Montgomery County.

The State Highway Administration and the BRAC Integration Committee are expected to explain the project in greater detail during a community open house at 6 p.m. Tuesday at the Bethesda-Chevy Chase Regional Services Center, 4805 Edgemoor Lane, Bethesda.
