
The Movement for Quality Government (MQG) asked the Israel Electric Company, Sunday, to break up a large solar power plant on the Sycamore Farm owned by the family of the late former prime minister Ariel Sharon. MQG said the plant received a permit contrary to a decision by the Israel Lands Administration and a ruling by theÂ Supreme Court.

MQG labeled as "puzzling" an initiative by Housing Minister Uri Ariel to change the procedure at the Israel Lands Council to allow lessees of agricultural land in the Gaza envelope region to build solar collectors.
