
Rare earth resources have been discovered in about 35 countries and        regions around the world, with total reserves of 140 million tons, of        which 39.3% are owned by China.

As China is rich in rare earth resources and has made strenuous efforts        in mining, over 90% of global rare earth output comes from China.        However, affected by the government's control on exploration of rare        earths, the output of rare earth in China has been continuing to decline        in recent years, to 83,400 tons in 2013, down 16.6% from a year ago.

China is not only a large producer of rare earth but a big consumer,        with consumption in 2013 approximating 79,000 tons. Among all        application fields, magnetic materials made the largest contribution,        accounting for 45% or so.

Besides satisfying domestic demand, China's rare earth and its products        are also exported to the United States, Japan, South Korea and Hong        Kong, with export volume of rare earth products reaching about 22,500        tons in 2013, surging by 38% from the previous year. However, hit by        sluggish domestic and foreign demands, the price for rare earth has been        falling, resulting in a year-on-year decline of 37% in export value of        Chinese rare earth products in 2013.
