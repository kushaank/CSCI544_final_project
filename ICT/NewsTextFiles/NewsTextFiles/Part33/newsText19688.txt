
Deputy Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin today appealed to the constituents of Teluk Intan to vote for Datuk Mah Siew Keong of the Barisan Nasional (BN) in the by-election on May 31, saying Mah had a good track record as the MP in the two terms from 1999.

His service to the constituents during the two terms was one of the factors that led to his selection as the BN candidate because he was well known in the constituency and had proven himself as the MP, he said.

Mah, the Gerakan president, had served as the MP from 1999 to 2008. In 2008, he lost to DAP's M. Manogaran and in 2013, to Seah Leong Peng. The by-election is being held following the death of Seah on May 1.

Muhyiddin (pic), who is the BN deputy chairman, said he hoped that the 60,349 voters in Teluk Intan would vote for Mah, who is a native of Teluk Intan.

"The (BN) leadership has chosen Mah based on his experience in the government and party, the constituents know him and he has done a lot for them," Muhyiddin told reporters after nomination for the parliamentary by-election at the Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Seri Perak in Teluk Intan.

Replying to a question, Muhyiddin dismissed the assumption that Mah was a recycled candidate, saying the important thing was understanding the aspirations of the constituents.

Mah is being fielded for the fifth time for the Teluk Intan seat. He won the seat in the general election in 1999 and was re-elected in 2004. He lost the seat in 2008 and failed to recapture it in 2013.

"There are times when you win and there are times when you lose. This time, we are hoping for a change in the trend. We made the decision (to field Mah) after much thought," said Muhyiddin. â€“ Bernama, May 19, 2014.
