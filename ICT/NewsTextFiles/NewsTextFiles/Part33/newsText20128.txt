Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 didn’t crash, and the CIA and Boeing aircraft company could very well know where the missing plane is, the former Malaysian prime minister claimed.

Flight MH370 disappeared March 8 with 239 passengers aboard, sparking a lengthy and massive search.

Mr. Mahathir , 88, who was prime minister from 1981 to 2003, said the flight communication system “must have been disabled” — something he put in Boeing ’s lap.
