
So very proud to be serving a visionary President who inspires Africa. Please kindly enjoy these photos taken from inside the Plenary of the premier AU Summit ever held outside the fringes of an AU Summit (to discuss reform of UN Security Council). First one shows Journalists scrambling to get a photo of the Coordinating Chair of the C-10, H.E. Dr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President of the Republic of Sierra Leone.

Second shows the ten member countries Presidents and/or their Foreign Ministers plus the AU Commissioner are now well seated and President Sassou Nguesso has profusely thanked President Koroma for choosing Congo as the country to host this important Summit summoned by President Koroma.

The Summit has been a total success so far. The Heads of States are now in a closed session. Please monitor the official State House Communications news outlets for more comprehensive reports.
