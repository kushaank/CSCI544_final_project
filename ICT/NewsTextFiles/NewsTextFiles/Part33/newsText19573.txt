
The share price of Mirada surged on Monday morning after the AIM-listed audio-visual interaction specialist announced a major contract win in Latin America.

The contract, for its multiscreen product iris, has been placed by an unnamed large digital TV operator in the region and is expected to generate "significant revenues".

The revenues should start to come in the second half and are expected to "far exceed Mirada's yearly turnover over the next three to five years", it said.

The announcement came alongside a pre-close trading update for the year to March 31st. The company said second-half revenues were lower than expected due to continued investment on the Latin American trial, but margins were stronger than anticipated and profits should show an improvement for the year as a whole.

"The beginning of the current calendar year has been positive as the tier one contract win, announced earlier today, highlights the strength of our products and our ability to service increasingly large contracts," Mirada said.

Chief Executive Jose Luis Vazquez said that team morale is high after the major new contract, which "opens a wide range of opportunities for the company". He added that Mirada is focused on winning further similar sized contracts in time.

He labelled the new deal as a "significant milestone" in the company's development in Latin America.

The stock was up 14.8% at 16.5p by 08:30.
