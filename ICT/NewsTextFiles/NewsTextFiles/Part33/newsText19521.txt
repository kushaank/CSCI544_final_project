
As the Delta State government intensifies its war against the menace of suspected herdsmen in the state, what could be described as a “colony” of the suspects who terrorise local farmers have been uncovered in Ubulu-uku community near Asaba, the state capital.

Speaking to LEADERSHIP, an elder in the community, Iyase Austin,  identified the community as “Abugba” where there are farmlands which the suspected herdsmen use as a grazing fields for their cattle; adding, “These suspected Fulani herdsmen have been occupying our farmlands for over three years thereby preventing local farmers from making use of them for fear of being attacked”.

Elder Iyase Austin disclosed that even those who farm in Udo, a small village close to the grazing field, are now living in fear of the unknown following threats from the suspected Fulani herdsmen, adding that some time ago, a member of the village who challenged them was allegedly beaten up and one of his hands cut off by the herdsmen.

While saying that farmers in Ubulu-Uku community particularly the female ones have been subjected to untold hardship and hunger as a result of their inability to access their farmlands following threats from the herdsmen, Elder Iyase Austin however appealed to the state government and security agencies to come to their aid.
