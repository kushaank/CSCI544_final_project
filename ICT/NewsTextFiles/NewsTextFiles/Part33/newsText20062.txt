
Israel is providing emergency aid to help the victims of flooding in Serbia and Bosnia.

Israel sent medicine, food, blankets and waterproof clothing by helicopter to the region this weekend after tens and thousands of people were forced to flee their homes.

Jasna Ciric, the president of the Jewish community in Nis, Serbia, said all members of the Doboj Jewish community were safe, but some were still trapped in their homes without electricity, water or telephone lines.

Doboj is a town in Bosniaâ€™s Republic of Serbia region, which has a small Jewish community. It was especially hard hit by the floods.

The mayor told local media the city centre had been submerged and at least 20 were dead.

Israel is due to send more aid, including water pumps.

More cities have been submerged and cut off by the record floods, which have left more than two dozen dead and thousands homeless.
