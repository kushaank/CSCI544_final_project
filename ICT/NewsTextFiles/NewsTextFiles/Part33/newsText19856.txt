
NEW DELHI: After party’s drubbing in the Delhi Lok Sabha elections, a group of MLAs of the  Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) have told the party  leadership to take the initiative to again form the government in the national capital, probably fearing that if fresh elections are held as demanded by the BJP most of them won’t  be able to retain their seats.

The Congress and the BJP have said that they  are ready for fresh polls.  AAP MLA from Rohini Rajesh Garg, Mongolpuri MLA Rakhi Birla, Sangam MLA Vihar Dinesh Mohaniya and party’s Lok Sabha candidate from South Delhi Col (Retd) Devinder Sehrawat were quite vocal about the government formation.

Besides, several volunteers have also echoed their views based on the feedback of people from various constituencies but a decision will be taken by the AAP’s Political Advisory Committee (PAC).

In a meeting led by Arvind Kejriwal after the May 16 results, the MLAs strongly pitched for government formation as the people were angry with Kerjriwal stepping down as Delhi Chief Minister in haste.

The BJP managed to win all seven seats with a vote share of 46 percent while the AAP got a vote share of 33 percent. The AAP has 27 MLAs in the 70-member Assembly, all of them first-timers.

“You may call it a wild thought but we floated an idea that the AAP should again form the government for people are angry with us as our party resigned in just 49 days,” said Garg.
