
Prince Harry visited the Colosseum in Rome for the first time on Monday,    exclaiming “It’s amazing”, as he concluded a trip commemorating the 70th    anniversary of the Battle of Monte Cassino.

The Prince was greatly impressed with the scale of the giant arena, built    nearly 2,000 years ago, according to Laura Ciglioni, the cultural heritage    guide who showed him around.

His visit lasted less than 10 minutes, with the prince saying that he wished    he had a lot more time to explore the monument, the world’s biggest Roman    amphitheatre.

“It will have to wait until next time,” he said.

Tourists were surprised and delighted when they recognised the prince.

The visit had not been on his official itinerary and seemed to have been    arranged at his specific request.

When President Barack Obama visited the Colosseum in March during an official    trip to Rome, the entire amphitheatre was closed to the public, but for    Harry’s visit it was business as usual, with tourists milling around inside.

Wearing a pale blue checked shirt and jeans, Harry, 29, arrived for a private    tour of the amphitheatre as a group of about 20 Canadians and Americans were    at the same point of a guided tour.

They stood transfixed, with broad smiles, as Harry stood a few yards from    them, listening to the guide explain how the Colosseum hosted gladiatorial    fights, animal hunts and other spectacles for crowds of up to 50,000 people.

Mrs Quenneville, who was on holiday with her husband, son and daughter, added: "I’m    all jittery now."

Alyshia, 21, a student, said: "It was unbelievable – better than the    Colosseum."
