
Stouffvile firefighters  announced support for Liberal incumbent Helena Jaczek in Oak Ridges-Markham this weekend.

Jaczek is seeking re-election in the riding of Oak Ridges-Markham, which includes Whitchurch-Stouffville.

Jaczek "is a strong supporter of public safety and our local firefighters," Bell said in a media release issued Sunday.

Jaczek is not alone.

"Thanks to #Georgina firefighters for canvassing with me in #Keswick today!," tweeted Loralea Carruthers, the Liberal candidate in the riding of York-Simcoe, Saturday.

Ms Carruthers is a three-term York Region District School Board whose district includes Whitchurch-Stouffville.

The Ontario government agreed to provide firefighters coverage under the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act for six additional cancers presumed to be work-related.

Premier Kathleen Wynne and Labour Minister Kevin Flynn made the announcement late last month at a Toronto fire station.

Coverage will be retroactive to Jan. 1, 1960 and apply to full-time, part-time and volunteer firefighters and fire investigators.

The move came after the provincial firefighters association started lobbying the Liberal government a few years back to have the six cancer types added to workplace legislation.

Progressive Conservative leader Tim Hudak's plan to slash about 10 per cent of the provincial public service would mean fewer firefighters, water inspectors, teachers, personal support workers, nurses and therapists, the Liberals said Friday.

Election day is June 12.
