
Gov. Idris Wada of Kogi on Monday warned students of tertiary institutions in the state to shun cultism and other social vices or face the full wrath of the law.

Wada gave the warning in Lokoja while inaugurating  three blocks of hostels built by the state government at the main campus of the Kogi State Polytechnic, Lokoja.

The governor recalled the recent killing of two students of the Kogi State University by suspected secret cult members.

He said that government would therefore not fold its arms and allow criminals, in the guise of students, to continue to perpetrate acts inimical to growth and progress of the state.

Wada said that the institutions were purposely established to produce new crops of educated and responsible leaders who will take the state to the next level.

“Anything contrary to this is unacceptable,’’ he stressed.

According to the governor, the hostel project was embarked upon as part of efforts to improve students’ welfare and provide a conducive learning environment.

He said this would enable the school to produce quality graduates.

The governor urged the students to make proper use of the facilities and protect them so that government could do more.

Earlier, the Rector of the polytechnic, Prof. Mathew Ajibero, appealed to the state government to assist the school to furnish the hostels.

Mathew also urged the government to assist the school in the provision of water and completion of its road network.
