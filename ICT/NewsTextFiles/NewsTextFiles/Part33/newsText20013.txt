The violence has compounded government's apparent weakness in combating militias which helped oust Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 but now defy state authority.

The special forces are the best trained troops of Libya's nascent army. They have been deployed since last year in Benghazi to help stem a wave of car bombs and assassinations, but struggled to curb the activities of heavily-armed Islamist militias roaming the city.

Staff at the air base confirmed its authenticity.

Haftar and other militias have demanded that a parliament, paralyzed by infighting step down.

Haftar, once a Gaddafi ally who turned against him over a 1980s war in Chad, fueled rumors of a coup in February when he appeared on television in uniform calling for a caretaker government to end the crisis in Libya.
