
MONROEVILLE -- The last of the students hospitalized after a stabbing rampage at a high school was released Saturday.

Franklin Regional High School sophomore Greg Keener was released from Forbes Hospital, hospital spokesman Jesse Miller said.

The 15-year-old was one of 20 students wounded when authorities said a classmate wielding two kitchen knives rampaged through the school on April 9. A security guard was also wounded.

The hospital said Keener's family asked for privacy as he continues to heal.

Alex Hribal, 16, has been charged as an adult with 21 counts of attempted homicide and aggravated assault.

He is scheduled for a June 4 preliminary hearing.

Defense attorney Patrick Thomassey has acknowledged Hribal stabbed the victims and seeks to have his case sent to juvenile court, where he would face incarceration until age 21.

Thomassey has argued that Hribal's mental state should be considered in determining whether he be tried as a juvenile or in the boy's defense if he is tried as an adult.
