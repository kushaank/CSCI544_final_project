
Philippine officials in Saudi Arabia are seeking intervention from Saudi authorities for an overseas Filipino worker who was reportedly scalded by her abusive employer.

The OFW is now under the custody of the Philippine Embassy in Saudi Arabia, according to a report posted Monday on Arab News .

“We will request immediate police and medical intervention,” the report quoted an embassy official as saying.

The report said the OFW was taken to a hospital six hours after her employer allegedly poured boiling water on her—only to be brought back home later to continue working.

Arab News quoted a relative of the OFW as saying the OFW arrived in Riyadh in March to work as a domestic helper.

She reportedly had communication problems with her employer since she could not understand Arabic or English. She was allegedly beaten up and scalded, and sometimes not given food.

Despite her injuries, the employer did not immediately bring her to a clinic for medical treatment. But once she was brought there, she managed to contact her relatives.

Images of the OFW with severe burns were posted on social networking site Facebook last Saturday, the Arab News report said.
