
HAVANA, May 19 (Reuters) - This year's Cuban sugar harvest is all but over at 1.6 million tonnes, similar to the previous season but 200,000 tonnes short of the official forecast after unusually rainy and hot weather impeded production.

"Production topped the last harvest by 40,000 tonnes and various mills remain open to increase the volume," the National Information Agency reported on Sunday, citing a statement by the head of the Cuban sugar workers union, Jose Perez Perez.

"The president of the (state-run) sugar group, Orlando Garcia, made a similar statement in a letter sent to Santiago de Cuba," the information agency said.

Just five of the Caribbean island's 13 sugar-producing provinces have met their plans with heavy rainfall across the country putting in doubt any significant increase in output before the last mill closes.

The sugar harvest begins in December with the "winter" season and runs into May as the summer heat and rains begin. January through March are the key months as dry and cool weather usually increase yields, but not this year.
