Attending the workshop were representatives from throughout Micronesia and Hawaii who are included in the strategy.

The BRP was developed to evaluate invasive species risks to marine, terrestrial and freshwater eco-systems in Micronesia and Hawaii and to make recommendations to remove or minimize and manage these risks.

Secretariat of the Pacifc Community deputy director of the land resources division Ken Voconasinga said, "The plan involves having countries being prepared to address any invasive species that comes in it involves organizing monthly stake holders within its jurisdictions because it is not a one agency activity organize within the communities and then being to have systems in place to be able to detect early detections of incursions of alien species."

The Department of Defense provided $3.7 million for the development of the BRP, as well several hundreds of thousands of dollars came from in-kind support from government and non-government organizations.

Input for the BRP is from Guam, the federal government, CNMI, Palau, FSM, Yap, Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei,  the Marshal Islands and Hawaii.
