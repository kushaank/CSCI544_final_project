
New Delhi, May 19: Congress leader Kamal Nath reportedly expressed his desire to become the Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha as both Sonia and Rahul Gandhi were not keen to hold the post.

After the poll debacle in the recently concluded Lok Sabha election, Congress, with only 44 Lok Sabha MPs, is in the midst of rethinking its House strategy.

One former Congress minister, on the condition of anonymity, was quoted as saying, "We are getting indications from Rahul Gandhi's core team that he may not want to be the leader of Opposition. Rahul would want to focus on organisational revamp."

Now, it seems that Kamal Nath once again may save the party's face as it has been struggling to form the Opposition in the lower house of the Parliament with 44 seats only.

Kamal Nath, who held the portfolio of the Union parliamentary affairs minister, was one of the only two from the party to win in this Lok Sabha poll from Madhya Pradesh. He got 559,755 votes at Chhindwara to the 443,218 for his Bharatiya Janata Party rival, Chandrabhan Kuber Singh, a local MLA.

The other man to retain his seat in the rout was Jyotiraditya Scindia, the Union power minister, from the family's Guna seat, defeating the BJP's Jaibhan Singh Pawaiya by 120,792 votes.
