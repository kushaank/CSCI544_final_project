
Kuwait will hold parliamentary by-elections on June 26 to replace five lawmakers who quit over a row about questioning the prime minister in parliament, a senior government official said late on Sunday.

Some Kuwaiti media have said the resignations of the five in April and May could lead to the dissolution of the 50-member assembly. By setting a date for by-elections, the government is signalling it wants to push ahead with the current parliament.  In recent years, the Gulf state’s parliaments have been repeatedly dissolved over procedural disputes or for challenging the government, in which members of the ruling family hold top posts.

Requests to question ministers have sometimes led to dissolutions because the ministers want to avoid such grillings or votes of no confidence.

Three of the MPs — Riyad Al Adsani, Abdulkareem Al Kandari, Hussein Quaiqaan — resigned on April 30 after parliament voted to cancel their interrogation of Sheikh Jaber Al Mubarak Al Sabah over issues such as housing and corruption.

They were joined on May 4 by former parliamentary speaker Ali Al Rashed and Safa Al Hashem, the only female MP in the National Assembly.

The five do not represent a unified bloc in Kuwait, where political parties are banned. Kuwait’s parliament is the most powerful in the Gulf Arab region but policy is determined by the government, which said Shaikh Jaber, a senior ruling family member, was not responsible for the issues lawmakers wanted to question him about.
