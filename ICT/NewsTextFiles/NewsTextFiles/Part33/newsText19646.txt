
Police assisted by Kenya Red Cross personnel have exhumed six bodies from a secret grave in Machakos County.

This follows a discovery of a second secret grave Monday a few metres from the one found on Saturday.

The grave was discovered by a herds boy in Kitengela who informed the area Chief.

The first grave was discovered by a man who was looking after his goats on the border of Machakos and Kajiado Counties.

The police said they will begin exhuming bodies from the secret graves in an abandoned quarry Monday.
