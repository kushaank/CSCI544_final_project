
Medicines made by Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH and Intermune Inc. have actually slowed the progress of a lung disease that has no cure and generally kills people 3-5 years after detection, according to two researches.

Boehringer Ingelheim's nintedanib and Intermune's pirfenidone do not reverse damage caused from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which is a lung-scarring ailment whose cause is relatively unidentified.

According to the reports in New England Journal of Medicine, these medicines have shown signs in slowing the ailment's ability causing breathing problems in patients.

Both the researches were discrete, and each was financed by the firms that created the treatment.

On 16th May, Intermune announced that it would offer the drug to some patients in the United States without any cost, a move that is perceived to boost the sales of the drug. However, both the drugs have not been approved by the U.S. medical regulators for sale.

As per the report of Coalition for Pulmonary Fibrosis, which is a non-profit support group for patients based in Washington, IPF has actually been detected in approximately 128,000 people in the U.S. with 40,000 people dying every year from the disease.

National Heart Lung and Blood Institute has said that the ailment causes deep tissues in the body to become excessively rigid and thick, or even scarred with the passage of time. The ailment tends to obstruct the functioning of the lungs to pass oxygen into the bloodstream, thus restricting the amount the brain and other organs get.

It must be noted that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected the drug produced by Brisbane, California-based Intermune in 2010. The company in February said that it has plans to file for a U.S. drug clearance in the third quarter according to their research.
