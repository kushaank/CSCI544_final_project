
JACKSON, MI (WLNS) - It's no secret many Michigan cities were hit hard from the recent recession and because of that many businesses left the state.

But as the state continues to recover 6 News Joe Khalil tells us how some business and community leaders in Jackson are working to restore their own city from within.

When it comes to Michigan cities the story of Jackson is a common one.

It's seen its heyday come and go, but today its people are working to help Jackson re-emerge.

"The conditions are right here and you've got great leadership in terms of the community coming together. So, I would expect this to be successful,” said Governor Rick Snyder.

Governor Rick Snyder came to celebrate the launch of the Anchor Initiative, a partnership of 20 Jackson businesses including Consumer’s Energy, Michigan International Speedway and Allegiance Health. The Together they will serve as the city's anchor and catalyst for growth.

The group is appealing to developers to come to the city’s downtown and helping build Jackson’s young professional’s network.

They say the key to revitalization, "the road out led me to South Bend, Indiana."

Leslie Youngdahl for one.

An idea many of Youngdahl's classmates shared. But after college she moved back to her hometown to work, live and invest locally.

"It's important that you get experience outside and explore and see the world so that you can come back and make your community even better,” said Youngdahls.

The governor says creating an environment in which young professionals want to stay in Michigan cities is vital for the state's future.

In a candid moment he shared his own experience, having to leave home to seek opportunity.

"There was no place to live in downtown Battle Creek. There were very few jobs. So although I grew up in a wonderful town, I had to leave."

To reverse that trend the governor says cities can take their cue from Jackson.
