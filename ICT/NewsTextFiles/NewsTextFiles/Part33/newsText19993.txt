Some 82 percent of those surveyed by Gallup feel that WHO contributes to protecting people’s health. More than half of the respondents (51 percent) think the organization contributes most by “promoting health services for the poor,” followed by “protecting people from disease” and “responding to public health emergencies,” with both at 42 percent.

The Global NGO Barometer 2014 by WIN/Gallup International Association interviewed 66 306 people in 64 countries about 16 leading nongovernmental and non-profit organizations. Organizations in the survey include: CARE, Codex Alimentarius, Food and Agriculture Organization, Greenpeace, ICRC, Médecins sans frontiers, Oxfam, Save the Children, SOS Children’s Village, Transparency International, UNHCR, UNICEF, WHO, World Vision and World Wide Fund for Nature.
