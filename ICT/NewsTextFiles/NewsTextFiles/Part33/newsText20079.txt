
UPPER MERION — With the most recent polls showing York businessman Tom Wolf leading the field in next week’s Democratic gubernatorial primary by a comfortable margin, the frontrunner showed no signs of slowing down near the finish line Saturday as he pressed the flesh at the Upper Merion Farmers Market at the township building.

“This is really fun. Not to mention the weather here. It’s perfect,” said an upbeat Wolf between greeting potential voters.

According to campaign spokesman Mike Nicastre, the last minute blitz through suburban counties and Philadelphia is designed to sway undecided voters to cast their ballots for Wolf and to encourage the candidate’s supporters to get out to the polls.

Montgomery County Commissioner Josh Shapiro was on hand, enthusiastically introducing Wolf to his constituents.

The latest Franklin and Marshall and Harper’s polls show Wolf with respective 17- and 35-point leads over his closest opponent, U.S. Rep. Allyson Schwartz of the 13th District, but Wolf sees an opportunity to cement his lead and perhaps gain more support in the waning days of the campaign, including election day; Tuesday, May 20.

“We’re all seeing the same (poll) numbers, but I’m working hard right through the end. I’m going to actually be in Philadelphia on election day. I’m not going to go back home to vote until (late) in the afternoon,” Wolf said before being whisked away to the next event.
