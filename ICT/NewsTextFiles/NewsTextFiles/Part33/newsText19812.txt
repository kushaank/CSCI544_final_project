MANILA, Philippines - The Armed Forces of the Philippines on Monday branded as "absurd" the accusation of various rights groups that the military was responsible  for the death of the newborn baby of the daughter of the late Communist Party of the Philippines Roger Rosal.

AFP spokesman Brig. Gen. Domingo Tutaan Jr. said Rosal's daughter, Andrea, was never in their custody when she was arrested by authorities in Caloocan City weeks ago.

"Bakit kami i-be-blame eh wala sa amin ang custody nya? It (arrest) was so ordered by the court. Absurd and kanilang kine-claim. She was arrested when she was already seven months pregnant. And bakit sya inaresto kasi may kaso syang murder," Tutaan said.

Tutaan also noted that when she was arrested, she was afforded medical attention because of her condition.

"Yung inaresto siya, seven months pregnant siya," he said.

Col. Demy Zagala,  public information office chief, said the military sympathizes with Andrea and her family "for their loss.

"To blame anyone for the death of this infant is both callous and unfair. This child is innocent and her death should not be exploited by anyone," Zagala said.

In a statement, women's rights group Gabriela blamed the AFP for the death of Andrea's new born baby Diona Andrea while confined at the Philippine General Hospital.

"Since her birth last May 17, baby Andrea has been confined at the Neo-natal Intensive Care Unit of the Phil Gen Hospital due to hypoxemia or blood oxygen deficiency.

"The AFP and the Aquino government virtually murdered baby Andrea when they refused to grant earlier requests for hospital detention for Andrea," Gabriela secretary general Joms Salvador said.
