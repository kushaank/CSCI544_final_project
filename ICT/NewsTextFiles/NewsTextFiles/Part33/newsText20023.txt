
Internal sabotage, an impression of lack of governance by the Akhilesh Yadav government, the policy of Muslim appeasement and frequent changes of candidates were held as key factors responsible for the Samajwadi Party debacle in Uttar Pradesh.

SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav called a meeting of all SP Lok Sabha candidates on Monday to discuss why it did so badly. Most candidates said they faced a lot of resistance from SP MLAs or ministers.

“Candidates from Jaunpur, Sultanpur, Pratapgarh, Ghazipur, Bhadohi, Phulpur, Lucknow, Sambhal and Maharajganj told the leadership local SP legislators and ministers didn’t cooperate with them and even worked against them in some cases. We noted these complaints, and will take stern action after verifying them,” a senior SP leader said.

The performance of some SP ministers also led to the defeat of SP candidates in their constituencies. This was most pronounced in Azamgarh, where Mulayam Singh Yadav was himself a candidate. The unpopularity of local ministers made his victory difficult.

“Dear Mr. Satish Chandra,

We continue to be impressed with your abilities, and your analysis of the Indian election results.

Please do understand that we at the CIA, and our sister agency RAW in New Delhi are your friends. We are interested in spreading our shared ideals of free market capitalism and democracy throughout South Asia and the world. USA is a friend of India. We deeply regret your continued hostility towards RAW.

We would still like to use your abilities for our common good, as a external consultant. Of course we will provide adequate consultancy fees ranging from US$ 25,000 up to a maximum of US$ 500,000 per week. Additionally, we will provide travel (first class), luxury hotel accommodation and reimburse your daily expenses at Arlington, VA, New Delhi or other undisclosed foreign locations. We will provide you with a secret alias, passport and diplomat visa arrangements for assignments in other countries or when required. We will also provide you with a CIA trained attractive female operative during foreign assignments.

Awaiting your positive response to our offer.

Sincerely,

LOL. Hilarious. I gave you a "Dislike" for this comment. Go figure.

With our friends in New Delhi, the CIA always strives to cement the blossoming ties between our two great nations - yours (India) and ours (USA). We at the CIA, have nearly accomplished our common goal of having the right people elected into your Lok Sabha, including our collaborator, Mr. Narendra Modi. It confounds us how Mr. Satish Chandra saw through our top secret activities.

Mr. Chandra has radical ideas about printing large amounts of your currency (Indian Rupee) to enable the GDP growth of your great nation shoot up to over 30% per annum. Our friends at RAW performed extensive simulations with the C-DAC's PARAM-Yuva supercomputer to confirm that India's GDP can indeed grow between 32.3% - 38.4% per annum should Mr. Chandra's idea is implemented.

We look forward to join hands with Mr. Chandra. As you can see, we have made him a very generous offer that we hope he accepts. This is not our first offer.

At the very least, we do hope that he helps us identify the nuclear warheads that radical elements in India may have emplaced in New York and Washington DC.

this satish chandra has lost mental balance. He blames cia for not letting him peee using Microwave signals.

Dear Mr. Charak,

You grossly underestimate Mr. Satish Chandra's intellectual abilities. I can assure you that your skepticism is entirely ill-founded. You are exactly what Mr. Chandra calls 'inferior Indian n!gger'

Sincerely,

I believe he has the same message which he goes around posting on different comment boards, irrespective of what is the subject under consideration.

The only good use of his presence here is to have some fun.

On the contrary, Mr. Satish Chandra is sheer genius.

fucking scum bag. Atleast do not use two ids altogether. You are a fukig noob. Now thier is a dick in your ass as the results have been declared. Micheal hayden cia. Fucking shit head satish chndra got 2 accounts with different profile . hhaha. Fck your mother the retard from Cia.

The above post may be an attempt by the CIA to have a torrent of abuse directed at Michael Hayden because of the "torrent of abuse" that RAW routinely directs at me that I have referred to.

“It is a matter of deep concern that almost all, if not all, senior officers of the Indian army have been 'educated' in United States defence establishments which allows their loyalties to be compromised. In the case of Dalbir Singh Suhag there is an additional factor. I have said Sikhs are traitors to India and played a major role in the British killing over 10 million Indians in just the ten years after 1857 -- their primary loyalty is to the Anglo-Americans, not India: ‘Source of Manmohan Singh‘s ‘Deep Love‘ for Bush‘ : SourceOfManmohanSinghsDeepLoveForBushDOTblogspotDOTcom -- and that is why no Sikh was made army chief until recently when J. J. Singh and Bikram Singh -- who recently returned after getting a military medal from the Americans without getting the requisite permission from the Indian government -- were made army chiefs in quick succession thanks to a Sikh traitor as prime minister given this post by a white Christian woman and now another Sikh, Dalbir Singh Suhag, has been made army chief; the head of India’s nuclear forces is already a Sikh. The Defence Minister is a Christian as was his predecessor and the previous head of India’s nuclear forces was a Christian -- all of them by definition loyal to the Anglo-Americans. Overt colonial rule over India is almost complete; Indians are too stupid and lethargic to do anything about it. My concern here is not religion (Sikhism is a branch of Hinduism like Buddhism and Jainism) but national security because of their being loyal to foreign enemies (possibly because both Sikhs and Christians are low-caste Hindu converts). This is also the reason India’s nuclear forces have so far failed to obey me (below) to trigger India’s nuclear warheads emplaced in Washington and New York with a warning that additional U.S. cities will be similarly destroyed if there is any retaliation or sign of retaliation, which will immediately make India the supreme military and economic power in the world.

In a letter dated July 27, 1982 to Indira Gandhi as prime minister I referred to an act, by American Jews, that was “the equivalent of an annihilatory nuclear first strike on India”. In her reply dated July 29, 1982 she wrote “Dear Mr. Chandra, I have received your letter dated July 27, 1982 and am passing it on to my Principal Secretary to deal with it. Sincerely, Indira Gandhi”. In December, 1982 I wrote to her “There was sudden, terminal, overwhelming violence against me during a seminar at Harvard University and rather similar occurrences earlier… India can expect sudden, annihilatory violence … with nuclear weapons … against its population … unless it can mount a decisively superior force to stop it”. Following my advice, India’s strategic program, including the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme and the Centre for Advanced Technology, was started to give India victory in a nuclear war with the United States and because of my influence on her, Indira Gandhi as prime minister was assassinated by CIA-RAW and later when Rajiv Gandhi realized the truth of what I had written to her after the American invasion of Iraq which was the first Gulf War, he was also assassinated by CIA-RAW. In the past few years, I have had India’s nuclear forces emplace nuclear warheads in Washington, New York and other U.S. cities and India is now in a position to destroy the United States without being destroyed. In fact, India is in a position now to destroy the United States without itself suffering a single casualty by triggering its nuclear warheads emplaced in Washington and New York with a warning that additional U.S. cities will be similarly destroyed if there is any retaliation or sign of retaliation.

OK, Shiv,

Your audience is quite civilized but this guy is a nutcase. Please save this blog from this kind.

who the f*** is this guy. He needs mental asylum.

My comment above was deleted twice by CIA-RAW and I had to repost it.

A couple days ago I posted a comment on outlookindiaDOTcom. A couple hours later I found that there were 4 ‘Dislikes’ on my comment and 0 ‘Likes’. A few minutes later, I found that the number of ‘Dislikes’ had been reduced from 4 to 3; the number of ‘Likes’ was still 0. CIA-RAW, which has kept me under 24-hour surveillance with the U.S. National Security Agency satellites for the past 37 years (see below) had done this with microwave signals from satellites; ordinary users can INCREASE the number of ‘Dislikes’ by pressing the ‘Dislike’ button but there is no way they can DECREASE the number of ‘Dislikes’. CIA-RAW routinely controls the number of hit-counts on my blogs, to take another example and can and does put false numbers, usually a small fraction of the actual number, in the hit counters. Note that falsification of vote counts in Electronic Voting Machines does not require the machines to be defective or physically tampered with; it is done electronically via microwave signals from satellites which leave no trace. CIA-RAW can do a lot more than change vote counts with microwave signals from satellites; they can alter the contents of any webpage at will but they can do a lot more than that also; just as microwaves make cell phones do whatever they do, CIA-RAW can use microwave signals from the U.S. National Security Agency satellites to make any digital equipment do whatever it wants; see IndianAirForcePilotsMurderDOTblogspotDOTcom .

This is what I said when asked if India is just a pawn. “Yes, it is a pawn, a slave, a society suffering from mass-psychosis. Despite the recent revelations about M. K. Gandhi being a homosexual who reveled in his "slavery with a vengeance" to the white man, who engaged in a fake 'freedom struggle" with the British managed by the Intelligence Bureau, the entire Indian government went to his memorial on his death anniversary this January 30, 2012 to pay tribute. India is a very sick society. (I had urged that all his portraits in government offices, etc. be burned). … By saying that India is suffering from mass-psychosis, I am being generous and kind of giving it the excuse of being ill (of the several hats I wear, I am also a mental health professional) but a country of 1.2 billion people being so terrified of much smaller numbers of people from half way around the world cannot really be excused. … ” (see RAWsTraffickingOfIndianChildrenDOTblogspotDOTcom ).

WARNING: DO NOT BE DISTRACTED BY THE TORRENT OF ABUSE RAW ROUTINELY POSTS ON WHAT I SAY. THESE FILTHY CRIMINALS WORK FOR THE CIA -- RAW IS A BRANCH OF THE CIA AS I HAVE DESCRIBED IN WhatYouShouldKnowAboutRAWDOTblogspotDOTcom -- AND DO ALL THEY CAN TO INJURE INDIA. THEY CAN DO THE MOST DAMAGE TO INDIA BY INJURING SATISH CHANDRA WHOSE TOE NAIL CLIPPINGS ARE WORTH MORE TO INDIA AND THE WORLD THAN THE REST OF THE BILLION-PLUS INDIANS COMBINED.

WARNING: CIA-RAW ARE CONSTANTLY COMMITTING VARIOUS KINDS OF MISCHIEF SUCH AS DELETING SOME PARTS OF THE COMMENT CONTAINING CRUCIAL INFORMATION, MOVING PARTS OUT OF SEQUENCE TO COVER UP CRUCIAL INFORMATION, REPLACING THE TEXT OF, SAY, PART 3 IN MY WORD-PROCESSOR DOCUMENTS WITH THE TEXT OF PART 2 SO THAT PART 2 APPEARS TWICE IN THE COMMENT AND PART 3 NOT EVEN ONCE, AS WELL AS DELETING MOST OR ALL PARTS OF THE COMMENT WHOLESALE MANY TIMES A DAY. NOTE THAT EDITORIAL STAFF OF A MAGAZINE CANNOT CHANGE THE CONTENT OF WORD-PROCESSOR DOCUMENTS IN MY COMPUTER BUT CIA-RAW CAN OPERATE MY COMPUTER BY MICROWAVE SIGNALS FROM SATELLITES AS THEY CAN OPERATE ANY DIGITAL EQUIPMENT. THEY ALSO SEND OPERATIVES TO SNEAK INTO MY RESIDENCE TO STEAL VALUABLE DOCUMENTS, ETC. The full text of the comment can be found at IndiasLegitimateRulerSatishChandraDOTblogspotDOTcom .

Indians as a rule are inferior Indian niggers unfit to talk about strategic matters, especially if it involves the White Master in any way, which it always does. That is why in his 'Mein Kampf' Adolf Hitler said "As for India, I would rather see India under the British than under any one else". It is not just that a handful of the British from half way around the world ruled India for centuries; a lot of other people from various countries did that for a thousand years before that.

A modern day Babar will start each day by killing a million Indians before breakfast every morning, though some think three million will be better (this number can be herded into fairly small extermination circles and then a neutron bomb exploded over them).

I am an Indian, but as far above the other Indians as they may be above cockroaches.

I am India's expert in strategic defence, the father of India's strategic program including the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program and the world's greatest scientist (my biography can be found in Marquis' Who's Who in the World, 2014 and earlier editions).

(April 19-21 ‘14) I had posted the following comment on outlookindiaDOTcom editor Vinod Mehta’s column ‘Delhi Diary’ last night. This morning I found it had disappeared. I reposted it. Less than an hour later I found it had disappeared again. As I prepared to post it again, my 59 minutes old comment appeared at the top, above about a 2-minute old comment by someone else, restored by CIA-RAW because of my reference in the comment to being suppressed on orders of the CIA. (In comments via the Facebook commenting tool, the most recent comment appears on top). This is a small example of hundreds of thousands of acts -- large and small -- of suppressing me that CIA-RAW have committed over the past 37 years. No matter which party or individual forms the government, it is the CIA which is India’s permanent ruler which all parties, government officials and Indian media obey; see my ‘What You Should Know About RAW’ (WhatYouShouldKnowAboutRAWDOTblogspotDOTcom ) and ‘India‘s Traitor Government and Media‘ (IndiasTraitorGovtAndMediaDOTblogspotDOTcom). The officials include not just civilian officials such as the prime minister and cabinet members such as Kapil Sibal but India’s service chiefs such as the current army chief Bikram Singh and recently retired air force chief N. A. K. Browne who literally sits at CIA-supplied terminals to make Indian Air Force aircraft crash using microwave signals from U.S. satellites and he can continue to do so sitting in the Indian embassy in Finland (see ‘Indian Air Force Pilots’ Murder’ : IndianAirForcePilotsMurderDOTblogspotDOTcom ). Nehru admitted to U.S. ambassador Galbraith that he was a lifelong British agent, Indira and Rajiv worked for the CIA as I know first hand from their direct participation in the CIA’s crimes against me and so do all Indian politicians.

(April 27-28 ‘14)  I have described how CIA-RAW have tried to have me run over while walking on sidewalks or crossing streets at intersections, assaulted by men in cars or bicycles, etc. At about 5:45 PM Toronto time as I walked eastward on the south side of Danforth Avenue, two  white men, perhaps in their 30s or 40s, came from the opposite direction. One of them suddenly veered toward me. To avoid a collision, I stepped aside. He kept walking then called out behind him "Relax. Crossing the street". When about 50 feet past me, both of them crossed diagonally to the other side and kept walking. There was no pedestrian crosswalk there and nothing to cross the street for and no other people nearby. People ask why doesn’t the CIA simply kill you. It is a CIA project to steal my work -- just my proposal about money they have stolen is worth hundreds of trillions of dollars in the short run and a lot more in the long run; see ’How India’s Economy Can Grow 30% Per Year Or More : How IndiasEconomyCanGrowDOTblogspotDOTcom -- while inflicting as much suffering and degradation on me as possible. With 24-hour audio, video and communications surveillance of all kind by satellite, stealing my work while starving me, they like it better than killing me. If they do kill me, they would like to make it appear as an accident or street crime rather than done by the CIA as part of a 37-years long crime unprecedented in human history and beyond description on which the CIA has been spending hundreds of millions of dollars per year for 37 years. India’s RAW participates, using CIA-supplied terminals, in all aspects of this crime including surveillance and attempts to kill me and make it look like a street crime. Former Union minister Mani Shankar Aiyar and current Union Minister Kapil Sibal personally participate in these crimes via these terminals as I have said. On April 26 ‘14 I found that CIA-RAW had created an account using my photograph with user name "Kaal 123" on Pakistan Defence Forum (I once had an account with user name "Kaal" or "Kaal 2009" on Pakistan Defence Forum but it has been banned for years) and posting material from my blogs in my name but including a sentence -- ‘If you encounter a Tamil and a snake, kill the Tamil first’ -- which I have never uttered in writing or otherwise; CIA-RAW had done this hoping I will not post my comments in the general Indian media; when I did not oblige, it banned this account it had just created. Several years ago, RAW made a call to my home phone and one of them asked his colleague "Kya Kar Raha Hai? (What is he doing?) and (again in Hindi) whether I had taken my (evening) walk, unaware that I could hear him.

Since I wrote the above, I have said that, instead of being machine-gunned and bulldozed into trenches, Indians in a position to obstruct India’s nuclear supremacy over the most powerful white country will be destroyed with the nuclear destruction of New Delhi (see my blog titled 'Nuclear Supremacy For India Over U.S.' ).

I have written (for example in my article titled ‘India’s Technological and Economic Emancipation’ in my blog titled 'Nuclear Supremacy For India Over U.S.' : nuclearsupremacyforindiaoverusDOTblogspotDOTcom ) about the continued control of Indian intelligence agencies by British and later American intelligence agencies after 1947. India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) was split off from the Intelligence Bureau which had continued after 1947 to be loyal to the British. Later the Americans supplanted the British and RAW functions as a branch of the CIA against India. As part of this relationship, CIA-RAW exercises extensive control over the Indian media and, among its various activities, engages in sabotage of indigenous research and development to keep India dependent on other countries for defence and other equipment (the nuclear deal is just another CIA-RAW operation of that kind, though of a scope and with consequences far graver than any such operation till now).

An example of this is a Bharat-Rakshak discussion thread about a black box installed by the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) in the indigenously developed Arjun tank that documented the sabotage of its engines during trials by the Army; such sabotage has been the basis of the Army's rejection, on RAW's prompting, of the Arjun tank in favour of imports (as I said in the above article, India‘s Army is the collaborator Army that helped the British rule India and, even after Independence, all its regiments and units have retained their former identities and regularly celebrate the anniversaries of their founding by the British). A CIA-RAW operative, who serves as a moderator on Bharat-Rakshak and controls the forum, recently locked away this discussion thread so that numerous posts that had appeared documenting the sabotage of the Arjun tank were covered up. The major metropolitan newspapers, on most of which CIA-RAW exercises extensive control, have made no mention of the black box -- which was like the flight data recorder in aircraft -- installed by DRDO in Arjun tanks and the shocking findings about the sabotage even though a report on this was provided to them by the Indo Asian News Service (IANS).

There is across the board sabotage by various means by CIA-RAW to keep India down technologically, economically and militarily. RAW's grip over India is comparable to the old KGB's grip over the Soviet Union, with the difference that whereas the KGB worked for the good of the Soviet Union, except toward the end, RAW has always worked for its imperialist paymasters. The role of politicians in governing India is insignificant compared to that of CIA-RAW but RAW has no place in the public's consciousness or in discussions of public affairs in India.

An important point about the sabotage of Arjun is that people on the Arjun discussion thread on Bharat-Rakshak were aghast at the Army's behavior and calling for Army brass being tried for treason, etc. but it will be a mistake to stop with the Army; it is RAW which is behind such sabotage not just of Arjun but of India's interests, technological, economic and other, in a lot of areas. RAW has operatives in the Army at various levels but it is necessary to go to the root of the problem. RAW has to be destroyed and I have suggested that a brand new external intelligence agency be formed with the help of military intelligence (RAW is supposed to be India's external intelligence agency but at least 90% of its activities are within India, against India).

The destruction of RAW does not mean simply disbanding the agency and letting its employees continue their service to the CIA through other organisations, old or new, or in other roles. It is a mammoth agency with just the number of joint secretaries in the hundreds. It is India’s real ‘government’ and the politicians and civil servants largely obey its dictates. It puts the words in the mouths of cabinet ministers, etc., and determines most policies that are, erroneously, attributed to them. Any one, even a prime minister, whom CIA-RAW considers inconvenient is eliminated, if necessary by death, as I have said regarding the deaths of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and, later, Rajiv Gandhi in my article titled ‘How India‘s economy can grow 30% per year‘ in my blog titled 'Nuclear Supremacy For India Over US' on blogspot ( nuclearsupremacyforindiaoverusDOTblogspotDOTcom )which can be found by doing a Google search with the title.

Over the past many years, I have shown how almost all terrorist incidents in India since 1983 have been carried out by outfits controlled by the CIA either directly or through intelligence agencies in the region, including India’s RAW. The Jain Commision of Inquiry, which went into Rajiv Gandhi’s death, acknowledged that the LTTE, which carried out his assassination, was created and controlled by RAW. It was an open secret that MQM, in Pakistan’s Sindh province, when it was known as a terrorist organization, was a creation of RAW. But the same is true of many terrorist outfits that operate in India.

Another example of RAW’s multifarious activities, that I have described in press releases, articles and letters to the press since 1987, is its spreading heroin addiction and AIDS first in India’s Northeast then elsewhere to provide the United States with a population to use as guinea pigs for AIDS vaccine development, after the CIA was assigned the task of roping in a population for this purpose. I have described how both Rajiv Gandhi (after being blackmailed with threats of exposure of the Bofors and HDW kickbacks by Swedish and German media at the CIA‘s instigation) and Vajpayee cooperated in this. But terrorism, etc., are the least of its activities; I mentioned those only because the existence of terrorism is publicly known. Its sabotage of India’s research and development activities, of which the sabotage of the Arjun tank is just one example, is among the deadliest of its activities.

The nuclear deal and its various aspects -- replacing indigenous production of uranium and reactors with imports, the capping, rollback and elimination of India’s nuclear weapons program, media control and buying up politicians, scientists, etc. for this purpose -- is just the largest and deadliest of such activities, leaving out the 24-hour satellite surveillance and all the crimes, at the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars per year for the past 31 years, against India’s greatest scientist, described in my article titled ‘How India‘s economy can grow 30% per year‘. The point is that all the tens of thousands of RAW employees are guilty of the gravest treason and deserve the death penalty. So do all those -- politicians, civil servants and others -- who are willing collaborators of CIA-RAW.

Dear Mr. Satish Chandra,

This is Michael Hayden yet again. In spite of retiring from the Central Intelligence Agency, I do remain active in covert operations.

My offer to you is valid. Do note that it is very rarely, if ever, that the CIA actively tries to recruit a civilian. Moreover as far as my memory goes, I have yet to see a package as attractive as yours being offered to a civilian.

I sincerely wish that you would accept our offer.

Sincerely,
