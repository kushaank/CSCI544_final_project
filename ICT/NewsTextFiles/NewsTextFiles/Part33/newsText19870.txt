
BANGALORE: Senior Congress leader and Union Railway minister Mallikarjun Kharge is likely to emerge as the party’s frontline leader in the Lok Sabha and will be the Congress party’s Dalit face at the national level.

According to party sources, the party high command is expected to project Mallikarjun Kharge, one of the top-most Nehru-Gandhi loyalists in the party who had won acclaim as the Union minister handling both Labour and Railway ministry during the UPA-II tenure at the Centre.

Kharge, who has never lost any election in over five decades, is an astute parliamentarian and a good administrator. He was made the Railway minister after his predecessor Pawan Kumar Bansal was forced to resign a recruitment scam in the Railway ministry was unearthed.

Almost all outgoing union ministers have either stayed away from the elections or have lost. Kharge bucked the Modi wave and retained his Gulbarga (reserved) Lok Sabha seat by defeating BJP rival Revunaik Belamagi in a keenly contested election.

According to party sources, central Congress leaders, who are seriously considering to revamp the party organisation at the national level, had suggested Kharge be assigned some important task.

“Kharge, who is well versed with both English, Hindi and Urdu, may be named as the Congress party’s group leader in the Lok Sabha,” said a senior Congress leader.

Kharge, who was a minister in the cabinets of Devaraj Urs, S Bangarappa, Veerapa Moily, S M Krishna, N Dharam Singh, also served as the Opposition leader in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly, before successfully contesting the 2009 Lok Sabha elections from Gulbarga.

It may be recalled that the Congress, in its worst ever poll performance, has secured only 44 Lok Sabha seats against the tally of 206 seats it had won in the 15th Lok Sabha. The party fell short of 12 seats to get the recognition as the main opposition party in the house.
