
Kenya: President Uhuru Kenyatta has said he feels “terrible” that his Government is about to pay Sh1.4 billion to Anglo Leasing firms but that he had no choice because it is in public interest.

Uhuru spoke about his agony during a press conference at State House on Friday when he said his view about the scandalous contracts, which he described as a scam in 2006 when he was Official Leader of the Opposition, hasn’t changed.

The President explained the controversial payments stand in the way of Kenya’s planned Euro bond that is expected to raise Sh132 billion to plug a shortfall in the national budget.

“There was no way we could go for this particular bond without first having cleared our international obligations. So I gave that directive,” said President Kenyatta.

Attorney General Githu Muigai has said that Kenya should just pay up, because it has exhausted the avenues for appeal for the suits it lost in Geneva and London.Â  Uhuru, who had investigated the scandal back in 2006 when he was the opposition leader, found it to be a costly scam.

Eight years ago, President Kenyatta – then Gatundu South MP, asked Parliament to stop architects of the Anglo Leasing scandal because they would continue to haunt even future governments and even terming the scheme as a “scam”.
