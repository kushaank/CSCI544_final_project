
(ANSAmed) - ROME, MAY 19 - The theme of immigration and asylum, on which European Mediterranean policies focus, will have two turning points at a European summit ending the Greek semester of EU presidency and at the Euro-African ministerial conference scheduled in Rome on November 26-27 during the Italian presidency, Italian Undersecretary for European Affairs  Sandro Gozi said on Monday during a forum at ANSA headquarters.

"Greece worked well on the Mediterranean but we are waiting for the summit in June for an overall evaluation and then there will be a ministerial conference which we will host in Rome", said Gozi. "There, the key theme of a common policy on immigration and asylum will be confronted. There is a need to develop a partnership, connecting economic cooperation to mobility policies, with southern Mediterranean countries. But this partnership only works if the EU forges it as an entity and not as single states. It is a transnational theme and those thinking they can close down in their national short-sightedness and confront it alone are doomed to a grave failure".(ANSAmed).
