
Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia and all the other members of the Commission -- B K Chaturvedi, Saumitra Chaudhuri, Syeda Hameed, Narendra Jadhav, Abhijit Sen, Mihir Shah, K Kasturirangan and Arun Maira – submitted their resignations to the Prime Minster's Office through Planning Secretary Sindhushree Khullar.

“The external world is changing rapidly. The structure of the economy and the role of the state in the economy are also changing. With an increasingly open and liberalised economy with a greater reliance on market mechanisms, we need to reflect on what needs to be the role of the Planning Commission in this new world,” Dr. Singh said, asking the panel’s members to reorient themselves to remain relevant.
