
THE ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST AFRICAN STATES (ECOWAS) has  learnt with deep concern the rapid deterioration of the political and security  situation in Kidal, which resulted in several casualties in the night of 17-18  May 2014.

The President of the ECOWAS Commission strongly condemns the  deplorable acts of violence in Kidal, which followed the visit of the Malian  Prime Minister to the locality. He particularly deplores the unfortunate loss of  life and injuries on both sides and presents his heartfelt condolences to the  Government and the bereaved families.

The President of the Commission takes this opportunity to reiterate the total  commitment of ECOWAS to the 18 June 2013 Ouagadougou Preliminary  Agreement to the Elections and Inclusive Peace Talks, in particular its core  principles relating to the territorial integrity, sovereignty, and secular  character of the State of Mali. He exhorts all parties to exercise maximum  restraint and to seek mutually acceptable sustainable solutions to the crisis  through peaceful means.

To this end, the President of the Commission calls on all the Malian  stakeholders to return to the spirit of the Ouagadougou Agreement and to  work towards the immediate implementation of the Guidelines recently  defined by the Malian President, H.E. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, to ensure the  effective commencement of inclusive dialogue with the armed groups.
