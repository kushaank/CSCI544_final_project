
Indiaâ€™s Tata Communications, which owns 67-percent of Neotel, announced today in a statement that the deal had received approval from both Neotel and Vodacom shareholders. The transaction is subject to approval by regulators.

Vodacom, which is South Africaâ€™s largest mobile operator by subscribers, issued a separate statement, in which it said that the acquisition will bring significant benefits to its business, including the opportunity to accelerate the roll-out of 4G services.

For UK parent Vodafone, the deal will strengthen its foothold in South Africaâ€™s fast-growing telecommunication market.

In todayâ€™s trading, Vodafone shares were down 1.2 percent at 214.49p as of 13:16 BST.

Vodacom is to acquire 100 percent of Neotel for ZAR7.0 billion ($677 million), Tata revealed in its statement. Vodafoneâ€™s subsidiary said that it planned to fund the deal through available cash resources and loans.

The deal will give Vodacom access to 15,000 kilometres of fibre-optic cables, including 8,000 kilometres of cables in Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town. Also, the deal will give Vodacom much-needed spectrum that will benefit the roll-out of the companyâ€™s LTE services.

Vodafoneâ€™s unit also expects the deal to help it achieve significant cost and capital expenses savings in South Africa.

Meanwhile, Tata Communicationâ€™s chief executive officer Vinod Kumar said that the company was satisfied with the outcome of the deal.

Vodacom, which is 65-percent owned by Vodafone, reported today that its full-year earnings per share had risen to ZAR8.96 ($0.87) in the year ended March, from ZAR8.72 a year earlier. This was lower than the ZAR9.56 median estimate of analysts polled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 8.3 percent to ZAR75.7 billion.

Vodacomâ€™s parent company Vodafone is to release its full year results tomorrow.
