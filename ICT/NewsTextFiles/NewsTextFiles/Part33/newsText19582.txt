
The Banking Standards Review, conducted by Sir Richard Lambert, is expected to announce a series of measures designed to restore public faith in bankers.

Sir Richard said the new organisation also needed to be run by non-bankers and that banks needed to focus on their customers.

The report will not focus on bankers' pay or bonuses and will lack disciplinary powers.
