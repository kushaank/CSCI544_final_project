
That’s what marine researchers have been trying to figure out for some time now.

California sea lions are born in the Channel Islands off southern California. When life is good, they remain with their mothers for almost a year.  They learn to fish and feed themselves before their mothers wean them and send them off into the world.

For some reason, in 2013 mother sea lions were abandoning their pups much too early, almost guaranteeing them an early death. It’s happening again in 2014. Something is very wrong.

With only half of 2014 gone, the Marine Mammal Center has already treated 100 abandoned pups.  Most of them are so young they’ve never been taught how to catch and eat a fish.  Without the help of rehabilitation centers, these pups have no hope of survival. Even with help, only 60 percent of the rescued sea lions at the center survive to be released again to the wild .

Between Santa Barbara and Sean Diego, five marine mammal rehabilitation facilities are seeing the same problem.  The condition of the sea lions pups washing up onshore is cause for great concern.

Theories abound as to what’s causing this sea lion catastrophe.  There have been sea lion die-offs in the past, which scientists attributed to causes like bacterial infection or the negative effects of El Nino.  This problem, however, is different.

The prevailing opinion of researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is that fish stocks are much too low and mother sea lions just can’t find enough high-nutrient forage fish to eat. They go off looking for food and never return.  Fish stocks are indeed shrinking, as any southern California fisher can attest.  In December 2013, for example, authorities required fishers on the West Coast to reduce their sardine by more than a third – from 18,073 metric tons to 5,446 metric tons — to avoid overfishing the species.

Another contributing factor may be  algae blooms or “red tides,” which create a dangerous neurotoxin buildup in the sea lion’s primary food sources, herring and sardines.  Such blooms are also killing sea birds that eat affected shellfish, anchovies and mussels. This buildup, domoic acid toxicity , causes frightening symptoms such as convulsions, seizures, tremors, foaming at the mouth, bloody discharge, paralysis and death.

Meanwhile, marine mammal rehabilitation centers work tirelessly, with dwindling funds, to feed the avalanche of desperate pups.  Because so many of these babies have not yet learned eat a whole fish, volunteers feed them a sort of fish smoothie by blending nutritious, high-fat fish like herring with fish oil and water.

It’s an expensive proposition. A single meal for one pup costs $10.  The Marine Mammal Center can go through 1,000 lbs. of fish a day at $1 a pound.  That’s $30,000 a month just to keep feeding all the animals in their care.

Remember the story of Hoppie , the sea lion pup found wandering in an orchard miles from water?  He’s apparently just one of the many pups who’ve lost a mother and didn’t know how to survive.  His story turns out well, however.

NOAA and other marine mammal scientists continue to investigate, while sea lions keep struggling to survive.  Let’s hope that Hoppie’s happy ending is an omen for the future.

Another species that man has polluted and poisoned.  We have overfished the ocean taking the feeder fish away from those who really need it.  We dump our trash, and sewage into the ocean expecting that it will just disappear and we won't see it again.  Well, we may not but these animals do and are suffering for it.  When are humans going to realize we aren't so important after all.

I don't have to have my own children to relate to the sadness of losing their mothers.  Animals are the same as human that they can be very depressed losing their loved ones.  I don't know if the mothers abandoned the babies or whatever reasons, it is us humans who create problems and should clean up our act to save other species and I'm grateful to have this group of activists to promote kindness and compassion for the helpless and voiceless.  I pray the baby seal lions will be strong and be able to re-join their species in their world soon.

Polluted water, oil spills, not enough food, water temperature increasing,  depleted oxygen levels, lots of reasons.

The ships are letting their  bilgewater out in the sea and the mothers maybe died. That's for sure the ships do it.

I am really angry reading this - yes I am sad but more angry because I know that, what we as a species are doing to the planet, is only going to get worse and that there isn't enough being done to help these poor creatures. Bless those who are helping them.
