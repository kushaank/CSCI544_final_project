
(JNS.org) The heads of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and the University of California (UC) statewide system issued dual statements condemning a recent pledge organized by several anti-Israel student groups, including Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace, that had called on UCLA student council candidates to promise not to visit Israel on trips sponsored by Jewish organizations.

In a letter last week, seven pro-Israel organizations  called on UCLA and UC to condemn the pledge.

“The SJP’s motive is clear: to manipulate the composition of the student government so it is filled with anti-Israel activists who support the SJP’s hateful agenda,” the letter stated.
