
TERMING the current system as a sham democracy, Dr Tahirul Qadri has promised genuine democracy in Pakistan through a revolution. Given his impressive religious credentials, one is thankful to him for championing democracy vociferously, for some religious leaders out-rightly reject democracy. One also agrees with his critiques of current Pakistani democracy and his desire for a better democracy. However, one disagrees with his preferred method, ie, revolution.

Before jumping into the discussion, it is appropriate to follow French philosopher Voltaireâ€™s advice, who famously said, â€œIf you wish to converse with me, define your terms [concepts].â€� Blending popular desires with academic definitions, one can say that genuine democracy is when elections are regular and credible; corruption is low; government services are high-quality; people feel secure and rights are respected.

If one reviews all events generally branded as revolutions, three features emerge. Firstly, revolutions refer to fundamental changes in political and/or economic systems, ie, from monarchy to democracy or capitalism to communism.

Secondly, they are led by people outside current power structures. Thus, palace and military coups are excluded.

Thirdly, these outsiders use extra-legal measures, eg, war or demonstrations, to achieve change since current legal structures disallow peaceful change efforts.

It is debatable whether one should call it a revolution if outsiders topple the elected Sharif government through demonstrations and instal another elected government since there would be no structural change in the political system; at most a more competent elected government would replace a less competent one.

More fundamental is the issue of what revolutions have achieved globally, for there is not one revolution which delivered enormously improved governance immediately. Take the highly celebrated 18th-century American and French revolutions. All they achieved was to replace monarchies by highly imperfect democracies no better or even worse than Pakistanâ€™s today. It was decades later by the middle of the 20th century that governance reached the high levels prevalent today.

Consider next the Arab Spring revolutions. Governance quality has either deteriorated or stayed unchanged. Ethiopiaâ€™s 1970s revolution which toppled Emperor Selassie actually produced massively worse governance.

The 1948 Chinese revolution created mixed results, with land reforms combined with starvation, death and repression. It was only after Deng Xiaopingâ€™s 1978 peaceful ascension that China started its development spree.

Iran certainly has independent foreign policies since its 1979 revolution but its actual governance is no better than Pakistanâ€™s. It lags behind Pakistan on the Transparency corruption index and on many sub-dimensions of the World Bank Governance index. Moreover, there is more openness and freedom in Pakistan.

This review provides the rather sobering conclusion that revolutions often usher in more authoritarianism and incompetence and in the best cases only end up replacing autocratic systems by highly imperfect democracies that takes decades to mature.

With such an enormous time lag between revolution and eventual maturing of democracy, it is debatable how much credit for the eventual maturing can be given to the original revolutions, since there were so many temporally closer events that also contributed to the maturation. It is to these intermediate events and the question of how imperfect democracies in the West became better democracies that we must consider next.

A review of Western history reveals that it was not further revolutions that transformed imperfect democracies into genuine democracies but a series of social movements that incrementally improved governance over the decades, eg, anti-slavery, civil rights, accountability and access to information, womenâ€™s rights and other movements.

Revolutions are the right tool for transforming authoritarian systems into nascent democracies since autocrats do not allow citizen-led social change. However, they are an inappropriate and excessive tool for refining imperfect democracies into mature democracies, just as a sledgehammer is the right tool for breaking a huge rock into small pieces but a chisel is the right tool for refining coarse rock pieces into perfect statues. Revolutions topple systems; social movements improve imperfect systems by working within them.

Does Pakistan require the sledgehammer of revolution or the chisel of social movements today? Those advocating revolution forget that Pakistan has had three already, one each that helped overthrow or weaken Ayub, Zia and Musharraf. Revolutions are justified where the system is autocratic and bans peaceful advocacy of change. Despite its flaws, there is ample space in todayâ€™s imperfect democracy for peaceful advocacy, as shown by the ease with which Dr Qadri holds long-distance rallies throughout Pakistan. Compare this with the crackdown on lawyers and the media under Musharraf. Or compare the situation under the Shahâ€™s Iran.

People justify Tahirul Qadriâ€™s long-distance revolution attempts by claiming that Khomeini did the same. However, in the Ayatollahâ€™s case, there was the â€˜smallâ€™ matter of his facing certain arrest and possible hanging if he returned. Pakistani democracy, despite being highly imperfect, places no such restrictions on Dr Qadri.

Thus, Pakistan needs a series of social movements to help improve its democracy. With his impressive oratory, widespread grass-roots network and apparent commitment to democracy, Dr Qadri can play an important role in strengthening social movements in Pakistan rather than attempting redundant revolutions. His focus should be on educating people about the virtues of democracy, organising them and applying increasing pressure on the government through demonstrations if it fails to implement genuine electoral reforms in line with global standards before the next elections.

The matters of State in an Islamic country is guided by the principals of Islam, not by any other means. Therefore, it is impossible to have transparent democracy in Islamic countries unless the basic religion goes through genuine reforms based on modern and future times .

Pakistan is a young democracy, and still has many miles to go before it can achieve a true democratic platform. After all, some nations such as the USA have yet to achieve this in some segments of the country's institutions - especially when it comes to transparency in voting rights, free media and yes even free speech.

Pakistan needs to look towards nations which genuinely practice democracy in the true sense, and not emulate those nations which are in reality fascist governments claiming to be a democracy.

The writer seems to be so narrow minded or hateful of India that he did not mention how the neighboring country has deep rooted democracy despite so many religions, languages, and regions. It is a wonder how EC conducts a mammoth exercise so brilliantly that the entire word admires its efficiency and transparency. The writer cites all sorts of countries but not India.

@Robert, It is not clear from your statement that if the matters of State in an Islamic country are guided by the principals of Islam, then why it is impossible to have transparent democracy in Islamic countries. In united states the framework provided by forefathers continued to guide all matters of state,  the principals of Islam will guide all matters of state similarly, what transparency has to do with it. FYI, Islam is and was the first religion to enforce transparency. It requires that all officials declare their assets to public and present accounts of every penny in treasury to public scrutiny. The exemplary Islamic rule of five caliphs demonstrate transparency, and above all the prophet SAV had completely open and public accounts of his dealings. Now, if you are thinking that there is an autocratic tendency in Islamic leadership, so that is not because of Islam, it is the confounding nature of power. Quran declare about basis of governance that, "their affairs of state are run by their mutual consultation" meaning democratically. Does that means they can change the basic principles of Islam by mutual consultation? No. But, application and interpretation of those principals has to be agreed upon.

Afghanistan is a young Democracy and the outgoing Govt has completed 2 successful terms.

Because if Democracy is indeed in the DNA, its easy. Pakistan was formed on the basis of one-man-one-vote not being enough, an integral part of any Democracy.

And about your EC, it has nothing to do with transformation from an authoritarian rule to democracy, it is only about development of an administrative system from manual to electronic or at most 'more transparent.

@MEDUSA  Before you achieve that status Military will take over. But your dream is aplaudable.

" Given his impressive religious credentials, ... " lolz, no need to read further.

Pakistan is blessed with a abundance of political leaders who stay comfortably in a western country, decry the western evil society, while "remotely" lecturing and advising their Pakistani followers back home to follow democracy as interpreted by them, in their glorious and infinite wisdom.

Till you get the Mullahs out of the Government business; there will NEVER be a true democracy in Pakistan.

I think there is little chance of any revolution in Pakistan given the deep level of divisions in the country. The only hope seems to lie in evolving a workable democratic system. But what is frustrating for us is the fear that the men like Dr Qadri and their patrons will not let this process complete.

Election alone does not make a country democratic, if so then Hamas,Iran,and all other Islamic countries that  have some kind of election will be called democratic-A genuine democracy must have the following ingredients: 1) Periodic Free and fare Elections without compromise,2) Each and every individual and group must have equal right.3) Every one should be under the same laws as passed by Parliament subject to Constitution.4) If the Constitution does not offer equality before law then it is not democratic.5) If the country is not secular then all other religious groups are prejudiced against and therefore it cannot be called democratic, state and religion does not mix in modern day democracy.6) Military must be subject to Parliament and constitution and civilian government.7) judiciary must be independent and interpreter of the law. They cannot be independent if they have to follow a constitution which accepts a religion as a state religion at the expense of other religious groups. Pakistan can never be a genuine democratic country in real sense under the current format.

@Robert depends if you look at it from a western capitalist definition of democracy! Islamic as well as true definition of democracy is devolution of authority & power! That is what Qadri says too! Islamic way of ruling has a mix of all be it socialism or communism... be it capitalism or a welfare state... it provides equal opportunity for all and if it doesn't let any one go too ahead of himself in wealth hoarding it also doesn't let masses lag behind in poverty! one thing is for sure, it doesn't allow corporations to hijack democracy, it doesn't let a hand full families enslave democracy, it doesn't let a global elitist group decide the future of wars and breaking or making of nations!
