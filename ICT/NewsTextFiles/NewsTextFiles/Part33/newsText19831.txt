
MOSCOW, May 19 (RIA Novosti) – Venezuela has announced it will file a formal complaint to the UN and other international institutions over US interference in the country’s internal affairs that has aggravated the political crisis in the country, the Tasnim news agency reported Monday.

"We will be making formal complaints at the United Nations, since [the United States] is violating the UN Charter,” Venezuela’s Foreign Minister Elias Jaua said on the Televen TV channel, according to the agency.

The diplomat added that Venezuela will also file complaints to regional institutions, namely the Organization of American States, the Latin American and Caribbean grouping CELAC and the South American bloc UNASUR.

Jaua noted that Caracas has prepared a "comprehensive file" with evidence against the US president, secretary of state and other US officials, who allegedly interfered in Venezuela’s affairs.

"In addition to constantly threatening to impose sanctions ... Enough already; it is not for the United States to take on authorities that belong to international organizations," Jaua said.

The US earlier proposed imposing sanctions against the Venezuelan government over the alleged mistreatment of street protesters who have been rallying against President Nicolas Maduro’s administration for the last three months.

In response, Maduro accused American authorities of supporting the unrest in the country, which has led to 42 deaths and 800 injuries.
