
PORTLAND -- John Halseth and Robin Castro were nervous Sunday, one day before a judge could overturn Oregon's gay marriage ban.

They were among 3000 same sex couples who were legally married in Multnomah County 11 years ago.

Monday at noon, a federal judge in Eugene plans to release an opinion that could overturn the state ban and make same sex marriages legal once again in Oregon.

The 9th Circuit Court could issue a stay pending appeal because this case has no defendants. That's because the National Organization for Marriage, based in Washington D.C., was late in filing a petition in the case.

"The 9th Circuit panel could agree with the National Organization for Marriage, that they should have been allowed to intervene as defenders because otherwise no one is defending the law," said Ryan.

Oregon's Attorney General and Governor Kitzhaber have both refused to defend the state's gay marriage ban.

"I'm even having a family event tonight and we will be making 500 boutonnieres," said Foren.

Both sides say they will try to appeal depending on which way the federal judge rules.
