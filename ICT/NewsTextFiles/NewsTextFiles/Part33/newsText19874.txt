
THE launch of local group The Calvinists’ debut CD this week will be a bitter sweet achievement for the Bantry lads, as it’s dedicated to the memory of the late band member Taidhg Burke Neff.

Bass player and songwriter Taidhg was killed in a car accident in Bantry in the early hours of a Sunday morning last October.

The CD was recorded just before the tragic accident, so it features the musician’s many talents.

The CD ‘King of Lies’ will be launched at a special event in the Frisky Whiskey bar in the Oliver Plunkett in Cork city on Thursday May 22 when the band will perform for the launch party.
