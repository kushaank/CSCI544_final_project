
Prince Harry has paid tribute to the veterans of one of the Second World War's bloodiest battles, and told ITV News it "makes no sense at all" that it is often referred to as the "forgotten campaign".

Speaking at the site of the Battle of Monte Cassino in Italy 70 years on, Harry said the series of assaults were a "huge ask" and deserve "as much recognition" as other veterans of the conflict.

Fifty-five thousand Allied soldiers are thought to have died in the battle, with a further 20,000 estimated German deaths.

Harry praised the courage of those that fought at the famous hilltop abbey for months on end - crossing paths with the walking wounded as the climbed up to fight.

"These guys were being asked, directed to walk through complete open ground, knowing that they were going to lose most of their friends and probably themselves as well," he told Royal Editor Tim Ewart.

Harry, who earlier had laid a wreath at a memorial service for those that lost their lives in the battle, added that he was privileged to share time with British, New Zealand and Polish veterans - as well as Germans who came to remember their own fallen men.

"Listening to their stories and the banter amongst them - German soldiers and British veterans together having a laugh - it's amazing."

"I've had a few invitations to go down to the Abbey and have the ground set out by them, which I think is an opportunity I can't possibly turn down, so I'm sure I'll be back," he added.
