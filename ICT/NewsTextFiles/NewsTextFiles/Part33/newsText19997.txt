
After placating disgruntled MLAs, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat on Monday dropped from his cabinet state tourism minister Amrita Rawat, wife of his political adversary and BJP leader Satpal Maharaj.

Hours later, he inducted Dinesh Dhanai, a disgruntled independent MLA Tehri as the new cabinet minister in place of Amrita Rawat.

The move is being seen yet another Rawat’s exercise to stem any kind of discontent among the legislators of the ruling Congress as well as its ally Progressive Democratic Front (PDF) which the BJP could exploit to topple the government.

Yesterday, Rawat had bestowed cabinet rank posts to 10 such MLAs who were being seen from the opposite camp apparently keep the flock together.

However, former Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna is unhappy with the developments taking place in the ruling Congress. But sources said Bahuguna is seeking either a cabinet berth or PCC president post for his close associate Subodh Unniyal, an MLA from Narendranagar seat. But Rawat is not ready to accept Bahuguna’s demand for time being.

Irrigation Minister Yashpal Arya currently holds the dual responsibility of the state PCC chief also. Rawat wants the post to be given to his close associate Kishore Upadhayay, a former state minister.

“Bahuguna is not certainly happy as no one from his group has been given cabinet berth,” said a Congress leader close to Bahuguna.

After the swearing in ceremony of Dhanai at Raj Bhavan, Rawat defended the move saying the reshuffle took place on the recommendations of the state party.

Congress which is 3 short of majority in the 70-member House, is sharing power in the state with 7-member PDF, a group of mostly independents.

 Reacting to her removal from the cabinet, Amrita Rawat crticised the Chief Minister claiming it will spell doom for his government.
