
BHOPAL: Rapid urbanization and change in lifestyle are leading to a rise in cases of itchy, flaky rashes on kids' skin, experts said. Called paediatric atopic dermatitis (PAD), skin ailment affects one in every 10 children in the city.

The condition affects young and old children. Experts attending a CME on PAD at  All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Bhopal, pointed out indoor allergies trigger the condition at most times.

"Relation between increased wall-to-wall carpeting, rugs and allergies has to be understood. It induces risk of dust, dust mites and other allergens impact health of the family, more specifically children," said Dr Anurag Tiwari, centre for skin diseases and laser therapy consultant dermatologist.

AIIMS Bhopal assistant professor dermatology Dr  Dinesh Asati said, skin allergies in children need early detection. "Delay in treatment leads to physical and psychological problems. Studies have shown children suffer on account of studies in case of delay in treatment," said Dr Asati. Triggers identified include intense itching, scaling, redness of skin, blisters and cracking of skin, among others. While there is a genetic predisposition to ailment, more studies are needed.

For children, who may have atopic dermatitis, one of first signs is nasal allergies or kid developing asthma down the line, said government homoeopathy college assistant professor Dr  Juhi Gupta. In her talk on alternative therapy on atopic dermatitis, she said homoeopathic treatment has been successful. "Our treatment focuses on improving body immunity with minimum medication," she said.
