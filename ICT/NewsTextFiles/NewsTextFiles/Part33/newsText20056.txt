
The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson has lost his mobile phone containing    personal contacts including David Cameron's contact details.

Mobile numbers for ‘most of the Cabinet’, Downing Street officials and key    civil servants were stored on the phone, sources said.

The loss of government contacts is being treated as a ‘serious security    breach’ by No.10.

It is also being investigated by the data watchdog, the Information    Commissioner, the Daily Mail reported.

Mr Robinson, 50, is a lifelong Manchester United fan and was off-duty to watch    a football match at Old Trafford when his phone disappeared. It is unclear    if it was mislaid or stolen.

Last night Robinson confirmed the loss, but played it down, telling the Mail:    "It was weeks ago and it’s all over."

A BBC spokesman added: "When Nick Robinson lost his mobile phone some weeks    ago he informed some of his contacts out of courtesy. The BBC takes its data    protection duties seriously and as a precaution the Information Commissioner    was also informed.

"There is no evidence that any of the data on the phone has been accessed or    compromised. The Information Commissioner has since told us that he believes    the BBC took the appropriate action."

Earlier this year during a TV debate reviewing Prime Minister’s Questions, the    discussion was interrupted by the soundtrack of Fat Bottomed Girls, by rock    band Queen, suddenly coming from Mr Robinson’s tablet computer.
