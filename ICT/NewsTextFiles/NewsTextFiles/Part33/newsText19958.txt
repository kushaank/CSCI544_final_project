
Amid escalating concerns that North Korea will carry out a fourth nuclear test soon, China's foreign minister may be coming to South Korea.

A government source said Wang Yi is likely to arrive in Seoul later this month for a three-day visit that would include talks with President Park Geun-hye and Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se.

They are expected to affirm their joint stance on the North's nuclear program, in that it poses a threat to regional security.

Wang will discuss plans for a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has yet to visit the peninsula since taking office last year.
