
CUTTACK: The massive win of BJD in assembly and Lok Sabha polls, Narendra Modi's failure to sway voters in Odisha, downfall of Congress and such events in 2014 elections have encouraged Ravenshaw University here to include a special paper on Odisha's political scenario in its curriculum.

The university authorities have decided to introduce 'political and social change in Odisha' for postgraduate students of political science. A team of faculty members are busy designing the content of the course, which will be introduced from this academic session, varsity sources said.

The decision was taken at a two-day seminar, organized by the varsity, to discuss curriculum reforms. Noted political scientists participated in the event, which concluded on Saturday, and proposed a special subject on Odisha politics.

"Our students study political economy and history of America. It's an irony that they know nothing about Odisha's political background. Electoral politics in Odisha is a very interesting subject and a lot of research work can be done on it," said Bishnu Mohapatra, a former faculty of Jawaharlal Nehru University.

Initially, it will be an optional paper. The authorities would make it a compulsory subject after assessing the response of students, varsity sources added.

"The syllabus will be an amalgamation of traditional and contemporary development in Odisha politics," said Ravenshaw vice-chancellor B C Tripathy. It is being prepared under Mohapatra's guidance, he added.
