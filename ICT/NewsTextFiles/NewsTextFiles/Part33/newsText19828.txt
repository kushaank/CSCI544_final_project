
SIR – David Cameron suggests that rather than switch to Ukip at this    Thursday’s European elections, Conservative supporters should stay loyal and    await the outcome of his negotiations to reform the EU, provided, of course,    that he wins a majority at next year’s general election.

SIR – My problem with the European elections is that I don’t actually know for    whom or what I am voting.

Boris Johnson’s idea of sending existing MPs to be MEPs seems a good one, especially    if all other member states did the same.

But we could go one step further and set up a virtual parliament using    teleconferencing. This would remove the need for the charade of moving    between Brussels and Strasbourg, saving millions.

It would also stop unnecessary expenses claims.

SIR – Unfortunately, Boris Johnson’s suggestion that British MEPs be drawn    from the pool of Westminster MPs would be illegal under EU law.

In the United Kingdom we have used proportional representation for European    elections since 1999, when the European Parliamentary Elections Act was    forced through against opposition from the House of Lords. Since then,    European Council Decision 2002/772/EC has forced all EU member states to use    proportional representation for elections to the parliament. This prevents    the UK from changing its system for the election of MEPs.
