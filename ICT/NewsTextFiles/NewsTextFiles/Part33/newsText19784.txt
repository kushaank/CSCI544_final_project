
Transactions at district treasuries and sub-treasuries across the State nearly came to a halt owing to ‘over loading’ of the Directorate of Treasuries and Accounts server. The staffers struggled to log on to the website to clear bills. As the server did not respond, long queues were witnessed at treasuries and sub-treasuries with people waiting to submitting bills, including those pertaining to salaries and pensions.

The State government has set a deadline to pay all bills before Monday (May 19). The government has directed the department to pay salaries of government employees up to June 1. It also wanted the department to clear the budget bills as well, so that it could be bifurcated before the appointment day.

To ease load on the server, bank transactions were put on hold. It, however, did not yield the desired results, as there was a mad rush to clear bills. It is estimated that 3 to 4 lakh bills will have to be cleared this month. These issues were brought to the notice of the government, she added.

Treasury Employees Association Seemandhra president Ravi Kumar said every government employee and department was anxious to clear their bills, but the server was dead slow. The could not generate a single token per hour, and lakhs of bills will be pending if the last date was not extended. According to rules, all bills should be either passed within five days or objection should be raised, he said.

“The government should extend the last date. The treasury staff would be blamed if something goes wrong,” he felt.

There are 23 district treasuries and about 360 sub-treasuries across the State. Salaries, pensions, contingencies and Budget bills are paid through these offices. Close to 3,000 employees are working in Seemandhra, and about 2,000 employees are working in Telangana in these offices.
