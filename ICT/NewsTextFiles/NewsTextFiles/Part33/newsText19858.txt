
New Delhi, May 19: As the party President Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi owned up to their mistakes in a press meet on May 17th, senior leaders of the CWC , which is the highest deciding body of the Congress party, decided that the entire team was to be blamed. Hence, when the duo announced their decision to resign from the party, the entire CWC decided to do the same.

All these are speculations, in the wake of the humiliation that the party is going through. According to reports, the Gandhis will offer to step down in a meeting today evening and it is almost certain that it would be rejected. Inside sources say that all 34 members of the CWC could quit as a sign of collective responsibility.

In an interview with a news channel, Kamal Nath said,"only internal democracy could end "the culture of patronage" He added, Why blame Rahul alone? He should not resign."

Most likely, the role of the key advisors to the party, including Jairam Ramesh, would be dissected by the party this evening. However, the glaring mistake that sticks right into the eyes is Rahul's campaigns, which failed to convince the voters.
