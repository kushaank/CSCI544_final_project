On Monday, DOJ announced it would for the first time ever bring criminal hacking charges against a foreign country, which has targeted U.S. nuclear, solar and metal industries.

“I welcome today’s announcement from the Attorney General and will continue to push for the long-overdue development of comprehensive cybersecurity legislation to combat these crimes,” King said.

King has urged Senate Intelligence Committee leaders to try again this year. He serves on that committee.
