Coal India Limited chairman and managing director S Narsing Rao is likely to take up a bureaucratic assignment in Telangana.

Telangana Rashtra Samiti chief K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR), whose party is set to form the first government in the nascent state carved out of Andhra Pradesh is said to be “very keen” on Narsing Rao joining the Telangana government as principal secretary or chief secretary.

“Well, I am considering a new assignment in Telangana. It is a new state and there is a huge scope,” the Coal India CMD told The Indian Express over telephone from Hyderabad, where he on a 15-day vacation and may quit Coal India on his return to Kolkata, where the company is headquartered.

He heads the single largest government-run coal company in the world and is from Medak, the home district of KCR. A Coal India official said Rao had accompanied KCR to meet Andhra Pradesh Governor E S L Narasimhan to discuss government cadre allocation for Telangana.

On the post Rao is likely to join, he said it was a “fairly senior” position.

Coal India’s annual output for 2013-14 is down by over 15 million tonne, and new projects are non-functional owing to lack of environmental clearances and land acquisition issues. Narsing Rao who took over as Coal India CMD in April 2012 for a tenure of five years has three years to go.
