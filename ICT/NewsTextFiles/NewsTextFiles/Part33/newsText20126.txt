
The board of AstraZeneca has rejected the improved $119 billion (Â£70 billion)    takeover offer from US    drugmaker Pfizer , a decision that has caused a sharp slide in the UK    company's share price as many investors think it effectively brings an end    to the protracted and increasingly bitter takeover saga.

In a statement on Monday, AstraZeneca's board said it "reiterates its    confidence in AstraZeneca's ability to deliver on its prospects as an    independent, science led business."

In response, Business Secretary Vince Cable said: "I'm not telling them    what to do, they have clearly come to a firm view on the offer that has been    put to them.

"We will stay, as a Government, very firmly in a position of keeping our    options open.

"We have a clear view of the national interest in protecting research and    development, jobs and manufacturing here, and we have sent out that message    loud and clear."

Pfizer Inc., which is the world's second-biggest drugmaker by revenue, has    been courting AstraZeneca PLC since January, arguing that their businesses    are complementary and would be stronger together.
