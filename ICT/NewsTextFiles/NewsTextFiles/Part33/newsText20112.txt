
The work of the UK and U.S. in sharing our lessons learned on the care and treatment of the war wounded has been ongoing for decades, and of the most unique aspects of the care and treatment of veterans in the U.S. is the support provided by Congressionally Chartered Veterans Service Organizations. One of our American VSOs is Joining Forces with their U.K. counterpart at the Blinded Veterans U.K. Brighton Centre this coming week!

This exchange program recognizes the importance of linking personnel and communities together and highlights the mutual commitment to share best practices of veterans support and rehabilitation.

We thank our VSO partners for their unique contributions to the Veterans here at home, and applaud their efforts to share their knowledge and expertise with our friends across the pond!
