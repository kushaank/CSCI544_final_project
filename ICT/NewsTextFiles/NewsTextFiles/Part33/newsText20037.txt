The government is about to face questions in parliament over housing affordability as Prime Minister John Key is accused of "staggering ignorance" about the extent of the problem.

The row has eclipsed last Thursday's budget after an OECD report rated New Zealand houses among the most expensive in the world.

Mr Key is denying there's a crisis and the Greens say that's making the situation even worse.

"The government's housing crisis denial will drive home ownership even further out of reach, fuelled by the prime minister's staggering ignorance of the extent of the problem," said housing spokeswoman Holly Walker.

"Sometimes you've got to wonder what planet he's on."

Labour leader David Cunliffe says Mr Key is out of touch with reality and the OECD report has confirmed what Kiwis already know.

"Property speculators and mortgage restrictions are locking them out of the dream of home ownership," he said.

"We have a housing crisis, yet the prime minister is in denial."

Mr Key on Monday said house prices increased faster under the previous Labour government than they have since National took office in 2008.

"In opposition they are screaming their lungs off, but in government for nine years they sat about and allowed house prices to double - there's just no credibility in what these people are saying," he said.

Labour's housing spokesman, Phil Twyford, says home ownership rates are falling and people at the bottom end of the market are living in garages.
