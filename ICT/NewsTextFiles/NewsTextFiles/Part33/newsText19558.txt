
With the Extended Umrah Tourism Programme visitors from 65 countries can stay for one month in KSA following Umrah.

This follows a speech in March at the Jeddah Economic Forum 2014 where HRH Prince Sultan revealed that the limited tourist visa programme “Discover! Saudi Arabia” had been suspended to allow the government to improve infrastructure before welcoming international visitors.

Raki Phillips, area director, sales & marketing, FRHI Hotels & Resorts, a group which has its entire KSA portfolio of three hotels centered in the holy city of Makkah, said that although the suspension of the limited tourist visa programme will impact demand, “the GCC customer drives a higher average rate and is a more frequent traveler than an international one, so hotels need to focus their efforts in attracting that customer”.

He added that the Extended Umrah Tourism Programme should “impact the hospitality industry very positively, in terms of occupancy and revenue” and that KSA should continue to focus on domestic rather than international tourism since this “drives increased spending, brand awareness, economic growth and job opportunities".

Chris Hewett, senior consultant at TRI Consulting, highlighted that last year: “Saudi Arabia issued approximately 1.1 million tourist from a total of 10.2 million, representing 11% of the total market”.

This means a suspension of the limited tourist visa is expected to have an impact on the demand in the Kingdom but this can be offset by increasing the number of religious tourist visas and with the Extended Umrah Tourism Programme.

Hewett added that although there is an opportunity to increase international visitors, the country “still perceived as a closed market” and therefore in order to increase the appeal from this market, “this perception needs to change”.
