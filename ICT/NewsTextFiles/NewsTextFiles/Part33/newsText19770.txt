
The Government is ‘on the right track’ in delivering better adoption support, children’s minister Edward Timpson has insisted.

In a speech at an Improving Adoption for London event, Mr Timpson said ‘expectations of what can be achieved when the ambition and commitment is there’ were being overturned.

But Mr Timpson added: ‘We need to keep up the pace and continue to push the boundaries to drive up performance even further.

‘Adoption scorecards that show how long it takes for each local authority to place children for adoption are vital to this endeavour.

‘It’s early days for the Adoption Leadership Board, but I’m confident that the board will thrive under Sir Martin Narey’s leadership and will galvanise real improvements by bringing together local and central government, the voluntary sector and academics as never before.
