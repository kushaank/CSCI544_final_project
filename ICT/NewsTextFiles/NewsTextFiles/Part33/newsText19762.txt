Rumors of a grand wedding in Florence and Paris have been circulating for weeks now, and after an Italian wedding was confirmed last week, it now appears that the couple will now marry at a chateau near Paris and hold their reception in Florence, Italy.

While the party is sure to be lavish, not everyone is happy that the power couple will be in the historic city of Florence.
