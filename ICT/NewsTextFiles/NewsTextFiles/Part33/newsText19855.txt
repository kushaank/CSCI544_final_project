
A day after calling on Governor E.S.L. Narasimhan, TRS president K. Chandrasekhar Rao met him again on Monday, this time complaining against the decision to continue common admissions in professional courses in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana for the next 10 years.

Sources said Mr. Rao took up with the Governor the “injustice” to Telangana students if the common admission for EAMCET and other exams was continued even after separation of the State. In that case, a student from Srikakulam stood a chance of getting a seat in a premier institution in Hyderabad if he secured a good rank. This would mar the chances of students from Telangana, he reasoned.

The Governor had on Sunday approved common admission procedure at a high-level meeting that approved expenditure fund of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Mr. Rao had met Mr. Narasimhan prior to the meeting to inform the latter that he was elected as the legislature party leader.

The TRS president was accompanied by two IAS officers -- Coal India chairman S. Narsing Rao and Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs M. Gopal Reddy – when he met the Governor on Monday. He was keen on inducting both the officers into the administration of Telangana. Hence, he sought the intervention of Mr. Narasimhan.

While Mr. Narsing Rao is an officer of Andhra Pradesh cadre, Mr. Reddy belongs to Madhya Pradesh cadre. The former was sounded out for the post of Chief Secretary of Telangana, it is learnt.
