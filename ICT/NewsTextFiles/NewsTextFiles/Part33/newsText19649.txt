Mystic - Sometime on the night of May 9, someone stole the new 12-foot by 18-foot American flag on the Liberty Pole near the drawbridge, the fourth time someone has stolen one of the large flags.

But thanks to Cardinal Honda of Groton, the $225 flag was replaced with a new 10-foot by 15-foot flag the dealership donated last week to the Mystic Flag Committee.

John Kennedy, the vice president of the committee, said Sunday that Stonington police are investigating the theft. He said it was evident that the halyard used to raise the flag had been tampered with. Kennedy said Cardinal Honda contacted the committee after hearing of the theft and offered to donate one if its new flags. Kennedy said it has been suggested locking the halyard but if thieves then cut the halyard it would be expensive to replace.
