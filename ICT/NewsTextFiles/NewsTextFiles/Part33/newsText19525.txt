
The global launch and unveiling of World Free Zones Organisation took place in Dubai on Monday in the presence of His Highness Shaikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai.

The new non-profit entity aims to transform the way in which many economies across the world operate. It will operate as an association for all free zones in the world.

It is expected that all free zones in the UAE will join the organisation by the end of 2014. There are 3,500 free zones in the world and 66 million people work in these free zones.

The event was also attended by top government officials, ambassadors and consul generals to the UAE.

The official office holders on the board of directors include Dr. Mohammed Alzarooni (UAE) as chairperson, Luis Pellerano (Dominican Republic) as vice chairperson, P.C. Nambiar (India) as secretary and Rose Hynes (Ireland) as treasurer.

The UAE has been a shining example of the dynamic role free zones play in economic and social development, and its diversity and vibrancy as a business hub has put the country on the world map.

“World FZO will further enhance the development of free zones in other parts of the world. With its headquarters here, Dubai and the UAE are positioning itself as a major player in the world economy in the run up to Expo 2020,” said Al Zarooni.
