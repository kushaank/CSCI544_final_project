
CARLSBAD, Calif.--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., the world leader in serving science,        today announced a new collaboration with the United States        Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS)        and Pennsylvania        State University (Penn State), has been formed to develop rapid        methods to detect E. coli in food. The collaboration was undertaken with        the aim of providing genetic testing tools to the food industry for        purposes of E. coli detection in meat products.

Traditionally, the industry has used serological tests, based on        detection of surface markers, to type bacterial strains. Analysis of        genetic material by DNA technology presents a more comprehensive data        set, which allows for the ability to more accurately distinguish closely        related strains from one another.

The collaboration will take advantage of the extensive collections of E.        coli strains housed at USDA-ARS and Penn State, which will be made        available to Thermo Fisher scientists for genetic analysis and        subsequent development of rapid DNA-based kits for commercial        distribution to food testing laboratories. DNA from approximately 200        strains will be sequenced using Thermo Fisher’s Life        Technologies Ion Personal Genome Machine (PGM). Commercial tests        will be developed on multiple Life Technologies brand platforms,        employing either next generation sequencing (NGS) or PCR-based        technology.

In July of 2011, Life Technologies’ scientists partnered with University        of Munster researchers to sequence the E. coli strain responsible        for that summer’s outbreak, which was followed within ten days by        shipment of PCR-based kits to European food safety laboratories.

As a first milestone in the collaboration, USDA scientists will submit        the DNA sequence information for roughly 58 E. coli strains in GenBank ,        the public repository of genetic data maintained by the National        Institute of Health’s National        Center for Biotechnology Information . These 58 strains represent        part of a complete data set of approximately 200 total E. coli O-type        sequences the USDA-ARS will eventually submit. The complete set will        contain the six non-0157 strains for which the USDA proposed testing in        its 2011 report Shiga        Toxin-Producing Escherichia coli in Certain Raw Beef Products .
