Saudi Arabia on Monday temporarily suspended activities at its embassy in Libya due to poor security conditions in the North African country.

"This isn't a closure of the embassy, but a temporary suspension of activities," Saudi Arabian Ambassador to Libya Mohamed bin Mahmoud told Anadolu Agency.

The Saudi ambassador, however, did not specify the duration of the suspension, saying merely that he and other embassy staff had already left Libya for Saudi Arabia.

A member of the foreign affairs committee in Libya's parliament, meanwhile, said the Saudi decision had followed an attack on Sunday on Libyan parliament headquarters in capital Tripoli.

"The decision sends a message to the world that Libya isn't safe," Amina Amtar told Anadolu Agency.

She said suspension of the embassy's activities did not mean that relations between Libya and Saudi Arabia were strained.

"Saudi Arabia knows well that Libyan authorities are keen on the safety of all diplomats," Amtar said.

Saudi Arabia is the second country this month to suspend the activities of its Libya embassy. Earlier this month, Algeria likewise suspended the activities of its mission in the restive Arab country.

Libyan authorities have struggled to restore law and order since Gaddafi's ouster and death in 2011 amid the continued refusal of armed militias – which had helped overthrow Gaddafi – to give up their weapons.
