An open letter to our president,

If there was ever a time to put boots on the ground, this is it. Vladimir Putin will not stop with Ukraine. He will continue to invade other countries like Hitler did and World War III will be upon us. Then some day we will look back at this moment in time and ask ourselves why we waited and did nothing. As we know, history always repeats itself.

One of the first things our president should do is send 20,000 U.S. Marines along with Army Rangers, Navy SEALs paratroopers and special forces and place them on the borders of Ukraine, backed up by large armada of drones and a huge navy task force adequate to take on any further aggression.

President Obama should support this action and give the OK. Then he should get out of the way and let our military leaders take over and handle the entire operation. Putin will then realize that he is now dealing with the might of the United States military and he will not be able to second-guess them.

My guess is that the rest of the world will then join us in this humane effort to save us all from a third world war. This action will make all Americans proud and we will again be respected by the entire world. Our exit strategy would be to persuade Putin to withdraw its troops and go home and then we will go home.

This will be President Obama’s last and only chance to save his legacy. He can still go down in history as a good president. I can only hope that at this very moment, our president has given this momentous order to our armed forces and set this in motion, before it’s too late.
