
Bhubaneswar, May 19: Biju Janata Dal (BJD) president Naveen Patnaik will take oath as chief minister of the state for the fourth consecutive term on Wednesday.

Naveen disclosed the date after meeting governor S.C. Jamir here today.

Before formally assuming the reins of the government, Naveen is scheduled to visit his Assembly constituency tomorrow to meet his voters.

Political observers in the state are, however, busy discussing names who are likely to make it to Naveen’s cabinet.

Responding to a query on cabinet formation, senior BJD leader Kalpataru Das preferred to remain diplomatic.

“Naveen will take the final decision,” he said.

The BJD swept the recently concluded Assembly polls winning 117 out of 147 seats, while the Opposition Congress got 16 followed by the BJP with 10.
