
The Corporate Whistleblower Center says, "We are urging employees of a physical therapy facility, or a rehab center to call us at 866-714-6466, if they have well documented proof of overbilling, or fraud involving Medicare. In many situations, the proof can be through eyewitness accounts of the fraud involving Medicare billing. What makes us unique is we will assist a potential whistleblower package their information, and then once we are satisfied the proof is sufficient, we will get the whistleblower, and their information to some of the nation's top whistleblower attorneys. No other group offers this thorough of service."

In April of 2014 the Justice Department announced, "Two companies that operate physical therapy clinics in Washington, D.C., Virginia, and Maryland, along with three individuals associated with the businesses, have agreed to pay the United States $2.78 million to settle allegations that the firms’ billings to Medicare and the TRICARE health care program violated the False Claims Act."

The settlement resolves allegations that, between January 2007 and August 2012, the companies submitted claims which falsely represented that the physical therapy services being billed were either rendered or directly supervised by the physical therapist identified on the claims by his or her National Provider Identifier (NPI) number. Allegedly the physical therapist identified on the claim had no involvement in the services rendered. The settlement also resolves allegations that Alliance Rehabilitation, LLC, and Active Physical Therapy Services, LLC, sought payment from TRICARE for physical therapy services that were not provided by the physical therapist identified on the claim.

Do not go to the news media with your whistleblower information. Any public revelation of a whistleblower’s information could destroy any prospect for a whistleblower reward with the DOJ.
