
A giant poster has been put up in Sheffield to help remove pollution from the air.

Researchers say the banner removes harmful nitric oxide from the air, absorbing the pollution from around 20 cars a day.

Pro-Vice Chancellor for Science at Sheffield University, Professor Tony Ryan, told BBC Radio 5 live's Breakfast about his idea.
