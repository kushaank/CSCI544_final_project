
The United Nations office in the Kenyan capital Nairobi has heightened its security following continuous threat of terror attack in the country.

UNON Director General Sahle-Work Zewde has directed several measures be taken including further restricting entry into their Nairobi Gigiri complex only to persons with official business.

“Unfortunately, Kenya has been a consistent target of terrorist groups over the last several months, the latest tragic attacks having occurred on May 16 at the Gikomba Market,” she explained in a communiqué to UNON staff.

And in the drive to restrict access to the UNON complex, Zewde also directed that guided tours of the facility be suspended and deliveries restricted to the hours 6pm and 10pm.

“Deliveries should be announced beforehand and the registration number and names of the driver provided to the Security and Safety Service in advance,” she underscored.

She also directed that the UN Petrol Station be shut down temporarily and alternative fuelling options sought.

“All Staff and all Agencies, Funds and Programmes with official vehicles should make alternative arrangements for fuelling their vehicles,” she stated.

Managers have also been encouraged to provide a flexible working environment by staggering work hours, through telecommuting and a compressed work week.

“This will, inter alia, reduce the congestion along UN Avenue,” she explained.

The UN recreation centre and commissary, Zewde added, would also forthwith only cater to UN Staff.

“Visitors will not be allowed, and access will only be granted to those with a valid UN Identification Card, duly programmed for the pedestrian turnstiles within the UNON complex,” she said.

US, UK and several other countries have issued travel advisory to their citizens travelling to Kenya particularly at the Kenyan coast over threats of terror.
