
NEW DELHI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister designate Narendra Modi on Monday thanked world leaders for their good wishes over main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party's landslide win in the general elections but there was no mention of U.S. President Barack Obama.

"I thank President (Vladimir) Putin for his good wishes. Looking forward to making our relations with Russia even stronger in the years to come. India-Russia friendship has stood the test of time. We will further strengthen our relations in a wide range of fields," Modi tweeted.

In another tweet, the 63-year-old three-time Chief Minister (CM) of Gujarat said: "Personally, I have a wonderful experience of working with Japan as CM. I am sure we will take India-Japan ties to newer heights."

He also thanked Nepalese President Ram Baran Yadav and Prime Minister Sushil Koirala for their wishes, saying he value the neighboring country as an "old and deeply valued friend".

However, there has been no mention of President Obama though he had called up Modi after his win.

Modi had been denied U.S. visa since 2005 because of his alleged role in the 2002 communal riots of Gujarat in which over 1, 000 people, mostly minority Muslims, were killed.
