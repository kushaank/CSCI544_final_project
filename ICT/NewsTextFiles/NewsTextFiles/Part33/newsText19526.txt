KUALA LUMPUR: The strong ties between Malaysia and United Arab Emirates (UAE) in numerous fields will be continued and further boosted, said Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak.

In his latest posting on his Facebook account, the Prime Minister also expressed his highest appreciation to the government of UAE for presenting a mosque complex to be built here.

The mosque is being realised via a cooperation agreement signed by Malaysia through 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) and the UAE's Islamic Affairs and Wakaf Authority (AWQAF).

The mosque, which will be built soon, was inspired by the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi and is expected to be able to accommodate 30,000 people at any one time.

Najib also expressed his appreciation at receiving the Etihad Award (Union Medal) from UAE on Sunday.

Â "I feel very honoured in accepting the Union Medal from the United Arab Emirates which was handed over to me by Abu Dhabi Crown Prince, Sheikh Mohammed Zayed Al Nahyan yesterday," he said.
