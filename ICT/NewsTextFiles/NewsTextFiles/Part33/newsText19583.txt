
YANGON — Myanmar aims to reduce its poverty level by an ambitious 10 per cent to 16 per cent by next year.

Myanmar’s Vice-President Nyan Tun made the announcement to some 8,000 workers at a rural development event in Yangon.

With many earning just US$2 (S$2.50) a day, the government wants to change that by various means, such as providing government loans to small local businesses, which ordinarily have no access to financial assistance.

The target for a 16 per cent poverty rate within one year might seem ambitious for Myanmar, but it sets a timeline for everyone to work towards.

Dr Lay noted that apart from the loan, the money has to come, “and it has to be on a sustainable basis and to make sure that the loans are being used properly”.

“Aside from that, they have to be taught ways and means to generate income; and the vocational training, the education, have to be done in many areas just to teach them and to cultivate them and to nurture them,” said Dr Lay.

According to the United Nations, Myanmar remains one of the poorest countries in South-east Asia.
