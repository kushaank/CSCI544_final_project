Representing Jordan at the meeting titled "Changing Economies, Changing Lives," Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Ibrahim Saif expressed the Kingdom's appreciation for the bank's efforts to enable the southern and eastern Mediterranean countries, including Jordan, to receive financial and technical assistance, particularly in the fields of supporting and developing small, medium and micro enterprises, infrastructure, energy, and water.

He pointed to the economic and financial difficulties Jordan is experiencing, most importantly in the energy sector and with the huge influx of Syrian refugees, stressing the need for more emergency aid from the international community.

Saif also reviewed the political and economic reforms being implemented in the Kingdom despite the surrounding circumstances, as well as the government's efforts to put in place an economic vision and an integrated strategic framework for economic and social policies until the year 2025.
