
Just when we thought we were making the first steps toward transparency in fracking — in the form of EPA indicating it might require frackers, at long last, to reveal the names of the chemicals they blast into the ground in order to extract oil and gas — three GOP state senators in North Carolina stepped in to put a stop to all that.

“The felony provision is far stricter than most states’ provisions in terms of the penalty for violating trade secrets,” says Hannah Wiseman, a Florida State University assistant law professor who studies fracking regulations.

The bill also allows companies that own the chemical information to require emergency responders to sign a confidentiality agreement. And it’s not clear what the penalty would be for a health care worker or fire chief who spoke about their experiences with chemical accidents to colleagues.

While 20 states have passed some sort of regulation requiring disclose of chemicals to the public, many have made like North Carolina intends to and protected the information as a “trade secret.” What makes this newest effort different — and more worrisome — Wiseman  told Mother Jones , is how far it takes the penalty. As EnergyWire reports , individuals who leak information about those potentially leaking chemicals face both fine and prison time.

Right now, North Carolina’s banned fracking until lawmakers can agree on regulations. But this latest move could indicate that the Republican-controlled government isn’t going to be nearly as tough on the industry as hoped.
