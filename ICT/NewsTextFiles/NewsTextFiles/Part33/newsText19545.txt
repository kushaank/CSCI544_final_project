
'End duty-free car imports for MPs'

A petition has sought to stop duty-free import of cars for MPs.

Lawyer Md Yunus Ali Akhand filed the petition at the Supreme Court  on Monday.

It also sought a rule on why the decision to allow imports of  cars without duty for MPs shall not be discontinued and current directives  allowing that be cancelled.

The cabinet, finance and commerce secretaries  and chairman of National Board of Revenue have been asked to reply to the  rule.

The petition sought a stay order on the import of these foreign  cars for MPs until the rule was issued and disposed of.

Quoting a report  published in the ‘Daily Manabzamin’ it said the MPs were first allowed duty-free  import of cars on May 24, 1988.

Indian MPs use 1300 cc cars whereas their  Bangladeshi counterparts use luxurious cars ranging from 3000 to 5500 cc, it  said.

Petitioner Akhand said the MPs do not pay duty for importing cars  but burden citizens with huge duties for the same.

The petition said the article 68 of the  Constitution lays down privileges for MPs.

Since there is no mention  about duty-free cars for them in this article, the subsequent government  directive is in conflict with the Constitution, said Akhand's  petition.

“According to article 7 of the Constriction, all powers belong  to the people of the republic. As per article 19, the state has been asked to  ensure equality for all citizens.

“Article 27 says all citizens are equal  in the eye of the law and article 31 says the state cannot do anything beyond  law.

“During taking oath they (the MPs) vow never to get influenced by  individual interest while discharging duty.
