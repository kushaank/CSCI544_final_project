
President Park Geun-hye gave an outline yesterday for a new national disaster management system that involves the dissolution of the Korea Coast Guard, which exposed many loopholes before and after the tragic sinking of the Sewol ferry. She also promised a full-fledged reshaping of the Ministry of Security and Public Administration.

Instead, the government will establish a new disaster control authority informally known as the national safety agency. The Coast Guard's lethargic response to the country's worst maritime disaster and the ministry's chronic red tape called for a massive reform of the maritime police. We welcome the administration's approach to national disasters.
