Suspects Qari Naseer, Mohammad Faizan and Mohammad Hussain were shifted from Mansehra to Abbottabad in an armoured personnel carrier escorted by police vehicles.

After hearing arguments of prosecutor Shahzad Iqbal in the rape case, ATC judge Anwar Ali handed over the suspects to police on physical remand for 10 more days.

The suspects will be produced in the court on May 30 after expiry of the remand.

Sub-inspector Gul Mohammad, investigation officer in the case, said police were investigating if the suspects were part of a gang and were involved in other rape cases and therefore, they sought extension in their physical remand.
