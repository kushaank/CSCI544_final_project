
Casablnca- News of confiscated illegal substances in Casablanca’s International Airport are becoming increasingly less surprising.

On Saturday A French woman originally from Togo was arrested in the Casablanca Mohammed V Airport in possession of more than 3 kg of cocaine.

Customs officials at Casablanca’s Mohammed V Airport arrested the French national coming from Sao Paolo after she was found carrying 3 kg of white powder.

Like other smugglers, the arrested woman invested a great deal of imagination in choosing how to make the substance pass unnoticed. According to Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), the smuggler carefully concealed a considerable quantity of cocaine inside a multitude of soaps and rollers her luggage contained, and put the rest in capsules she hid under her clothes.

However, the suspect’s concealment efforts failed as she could not act naturally while approaching customs at the airport. Her attitude, according to an officer there, aroused suspicion. She was subsequently subjected to a thorough search, eventually revealing the reason for her discomfort.

The French national has now joined a list of suspects in the same category, who are still waiting to be brought to justice.
