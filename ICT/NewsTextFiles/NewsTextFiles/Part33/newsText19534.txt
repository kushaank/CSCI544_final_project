
The Government's Plan Melbourne blueprint for population growth calls for a stronger focus on Victoria's regional cities, to ease pressure on Melbourne.

Revised population forecasts show 2.3 million people will live in regional Victoria by 2051, up from the previous forecast last year of 1.9 million.

Dr Napthine says moving jobs and economic opportunities to the regions, and improving services and liveability, is essential to manage the state's population growth.

"What we would like to see is better balanced growth across the state of Victoria," he said.

"A state of cities rather than a city state.

"So yes we will see growth in Melbourne but we're also seeing, and excited about, the growth opportunities in Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo, in Warragul, Shepparton and Latrobe City."
