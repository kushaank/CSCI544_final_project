Prime Minister-designate Narendra Modi is expected to appoint a minister from Bengal for sending two BJP MPs to Parliament.

Sources said “Asansol MP Babul Supriyo may get a berth in his ministry; he could be made minister of state for youth welfare”.

Supriyo’s presence at the meeting convened by Baba Ramdev on Sunday in Delhi and at Modi’s meeting on Monday are said to be clear indications of his selection.

It is said the senior leadership at the Centre would want Supriyo to be party’s face in Bengal and carry forward the success of his debut in active politics at the forthcoming municipal elections and the Assembly elections in 2016.

While Supriyo said he had no idea if he would be made minister of state, Ahluwalia said he had been hearing about his ministership in the media but had not heard from higher authorities in the party.
