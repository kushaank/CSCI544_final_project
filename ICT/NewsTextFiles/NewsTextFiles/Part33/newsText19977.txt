OSHA said Monday it fined the company $40,921 for exposing workers to dangerous silica dust levels and other hazards. The inspection disclosed 15 violations, 13 of them serious, OSHA said.

An OSHA violation is serious if death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard an employer knew or should have known exists.

Silica exposure can cause silicosis, an irreversible lung disease, and other health hazards. OSHA began the inspection Nov. 27, 2013, after receiving a complaint.

Serious violations included allowing three stonecutters to be exposed to silica at levels nearly three times the permissible exposure limit for a work shift; failing to implement administrative and engineering controls to reduce exposure; and failing to train workers on silica hazards. An OSHA violation is serious if death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard an employer knew or should have known exists.
