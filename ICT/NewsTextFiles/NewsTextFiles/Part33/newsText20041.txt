
Addressing a press conference here on Monday, Bali said while the state party leadership was overconfident of its position in the Lok Sabha polls, it failed to understand the well- planned marketing strategy of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

“Party failed to understand undercurrent in the masses and 'Modi wave' that swept the state,” said Bali adding that the BJP campaigning in the state was totally a false propaganda.

Being a senior cabinet minister, I take moral responsibility for party's defeat in the Kangra region,” said Bali.

He, however, claimed that he had informed the state leadership about party's weak position in Kangra parliamentary constituency, especially, because of the wrong selection of candidate.

The minister said the Congress would take the defeat as a challenge and will work hard to improve its position.

“The BJP during elections has made tall promises and people of the state will see how soon they fulfill them,” said Bali, hoping that the new government would work to curb price rise, generate more employment and keep the fuel prices stagnant.

When asked about a meeting held recently by dissident MLAs in Chandigarh, Bali said he neither attended the meeting, nor he has any information about it.

He termed statements of the BJP leaders, state government would fall very soon, baseless stating that the Congress government would complete its five-year term in the power.
