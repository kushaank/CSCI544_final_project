(ANSA) - Rome, May 19 - Communications authority Agcom on Monday reprimanded four Italian channels for breaching Italy's rules for balanced coverage in pre-election periods by giving too much exposure to Premier Matteo Renzi.      The authority told two channels with State broadcaster Rai, Rai3 and Rainews, Sky news channel Skytg24 and La7 to restore balance to their reporting ahead of Sunday's European elections.      Agcom also reprimanded La7 and Rai3 for not giving enough space to the New Centre Right, a junior partner in Renzi's coalition government led by Interior Minister Angelino Alfano.
