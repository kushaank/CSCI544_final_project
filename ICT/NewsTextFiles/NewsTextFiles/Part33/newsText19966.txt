
The 'Maids mafia shock' article (GDN, May 14) highlighted a painful aspect of the recruitment process. However there is another aspect to be highlighted - bluntly speaking, several families employing maids cannot afford them.

According to your article, there are 87,000 maids in Bahrain. The total working population of Bahrain nationals is 123,956, giving an allocation of one maid for 1.5 working Bahraini.

The cost of employing a maid is on average BD180 (considering basic salary of BD90, food, personal items, medical and amortised hiring cost).

The average monthly wage for a Bahraini is BD614 (CBB 2011 data).

Therefore the cost of having a maid cannot be covered by most families, resulting in non-payment of salaries, poor living conditions, malnutrition and several abuses.

1) Increase the level of minimum disposable income for work permits;

2) Transfer the sponsorship to an independent body constituted by foreign governments/embassies of foreign workers in conjunction with Bahrain's Ministries of Labour and Social Development, as well as Immigration.
