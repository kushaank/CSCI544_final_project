
After 20 years of negotiations, the Philippines and Indonesia have resolved their territorial dispute over a resource-rich area in the Pacific where they have overlapping claims.

Following the conclusion of talks that started in 1994, Philippine Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario and Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa will soon sign an accord called the “Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and the Republic of Indonesia Concerning the Delimitation of the Exclusive Economic Zone Boundary” in the Mindanao Sea and Celebes Sea,” a Department of Foreign Affairs statement said Monday.

An Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is a 200-nautical mile area of jurisdiction mandated by a United Nations law.

Manila and Jakarta’s successful resolution of their sea claims came amid heightened tensions in another disputed body of water, the South China Sea, where the Philippines, China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan are locked in decades-long territorial conflicts.

China’s “indisputable” claim over nearly the entire waters has made it impossible for its smaller Asian neighbors with less military force to reach a settlement to the long-running disputes that have sparked several military confrontations in the past.

“This is a significant contribution to, and an example of, reasonable efforts to build a stable and peaceful regional community, in consideration of the interests of countries concerned and in accordance with international law,” he said.

Garcia said a clearly defined maritime boundary would promote more cooperation and advance both nations’ common interest of managing and preserving the resources in the EEZ.
