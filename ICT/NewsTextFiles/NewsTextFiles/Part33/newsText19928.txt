The ruling by a Pulaski County circuit judge was in effect for less than a week, as the state attorney general—who has voiced his personal support for marriage equality—has for a stay with the state supreme court, which the court granted on Friday. Even as it stood, most of the state’s county clerks refused to issue licenses to same-sex couples. Some clerks expressed concern and confusion over a separate law that may make it illegal for them to do so.

But early on Monday morning after the judge’s historic decision, Barrington and officiants from other denominations, as well as some judges and several laypeople licensed to perform wedding ceremonies, were at the Pulaski County Courthouse offering their services to same-sex couples. Among the dozen whom Barrington married was a couple who had driven from Oklahoma. There were dozens of joyous supporters on hand offering hugs and taking pictures of the couples, she said, and only one protester who didn’t stay long.
