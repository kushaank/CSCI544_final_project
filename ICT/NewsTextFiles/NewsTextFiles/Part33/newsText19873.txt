
Samsung has partnered with JCDecaux Airport to rebrand London Heathrow Terminal 5 as Terminal Samsung Galaxy S5 for a new campaign to launch the smartphone.

The two-week campaign, which kicked off on 19 May, marks the first time Heathrow has allowed a brand takeover of Terminal 5. The initiative was executed with the help of marketing agency Cheil UK.

T5 has been temporarily rebranded as 'Terminal Samsung Galaxy S5'

Samsung said it has taken over the signage, wayfinding, website and every digital screen at the terminal to promote the launch of its Galaxy S5 smartphone. All signage throughout the terminal, including all entrance and drop-off locations, in the lounges, at security and at the gates has been rebranded for the initiative, according to the electronics company.

However, a Heathrow spokesperson said that the terminal's signage and passenger wayfinding has not changed.  The spokesperson said: "Samsung have rented advertising space in Terminal 5 with a tongue-in-cheek campaign using the line: 'Terminal Samsung Galaxy S5'."

The rebranding also applies to all 172 digital panels in the main terminal, gate rooms and baggage reclaim areas, which feature the temporary terminal name and images of the Galaxy S5 phone.

Signage in the airport lounges directs passengers to Dixons Travel stores where they can try out the new smartphone.
