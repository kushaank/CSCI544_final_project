
Corvino will also retire from his position as executive vice president of Yale New Haven Health System. His retirement will mark a 43-year career in health care.

“Frank’s countless contributions, leadership and unwavering commitment to patients, staff, physicians and the community have made Greenwich Hospital and Yale Haven Health System stronger and created a lasting legacy,” said Marna Borgstrom, CEO of Yale New Haven Health System.

Corvino joined Greenwich Hospital in 1988 as senior vice president and chief operating officer. He was promoted to president and CEO in 1991 and assumed the role of executive vice president with Yale New Haven Health System in 1998.

Corvino has been a pioneer in health care, embracing advances and opportunities. His recognition of the value of being part of a system brought Greenwich Hospital into the Yale New Haven Health System in 1998.

Reflecting his vision about the importance of a modern, comfortable environment to provide patient care, Corvino launched two $70 million campaigns, resulting in the opening of the Leona and Harry B. Helmsley Medical Building in 1999 and the Thomas and Olive C. Watson Pavilion in 2006.

Yale New Haven Health System will conduct a national search for Corvino’s replacement with the goal to have his successor in place before the end of the year.
