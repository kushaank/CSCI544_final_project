
After a yearlong national search that ended back home, San Jose City College's interim leader has been named its permanent president.

Since joining the college in June, Byron D. Clift Breland has helped expand career and technical-education programs and also created class schedules to better accommodate working adults.

Rita Cepeda, chancellor of the San Jose Evergreen Community College District, lauded Breland's vision and dedication. "His extensive experience as both an administrator and instructor will serve our students and faculty well into the future," she said.

Breland, 43, previously worked in administration at the University of Maryland at College Park, the University of Southern California, the University of California-Irvine, Santa Ana College and Long Beach City College.

He holds bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Maryland, College Park, and master's and doctorate degrees from USC.

"Together," he said, "we are creating a strong pipeline for local employers that will enrich our community and fuel the growth in our region's economy for years to come."
