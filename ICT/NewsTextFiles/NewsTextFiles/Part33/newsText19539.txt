SYDNEY – Prime Minister Tony Abbott has suffered a backlash after an austerity budget that sparked street protests, with polls Monday showing support for his government plunging.

The conservative leader’s first budget since coming to office last September — handed down a week ago — took the ax to health and education spending in an attempt to slash the country’s deficit. Over the weekend there were street marches in major cities and a meeting of state premiers, including from Abbott’s Liberal Party, vowing to fight 80 billion Australian dollars ($75 billion) in school and hospital funding cuts.

One poll in the Sydney Morning Herald showed the Labor opposition now has a 12-point lead, reversing a 7-point deficit ahead of the September election. It showed that 74 percent of the 1,400 people questioned last week felt they would be worse off under the spending cuts. A poll of 1,216 voters in The Australian newspaper gave Labor a 10-point advantage.

Abbott, who has blamed Labor for the “mess” it left him, is aiming to bring the deficit down from its current AU$49.9 billion to AU$29.8 billion next year and to reach a surplus around the end of the decade.
