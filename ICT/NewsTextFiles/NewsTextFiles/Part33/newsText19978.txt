
Jury selection began today in Sanford for a suspect in a 20-year-old cold case homicide.

David Lee Hedrick, 54, is charged with first-degree murder for fatally stabbing a woman, the lone employee in a computer store near Apopka in 1991.

The body of Betty Clair Foster, 50 of Altamonte Springs, was found by a customer. She had been stabbed several times in the neck and chest.

Hedrick was arrested two years ago, more than 20 years after Foster was killed, when his DNA was matched to five blood samples found at the store, according to the Seminole County Sheriff's Office.

His DNA had not been in any law enforcement database until a few months before his arrest. That's because he'd only recently been convicted of a crime.

That was an unrelated tax case in which he was accused of collecting $72,000 in sales tax but failing to pay it to the state.

Foster had been a part-time employee at the store, MyComp Computer Corp., and worked as a receptionist.

Authorities said at the time of Hedrick's arrest that they were not sure what motivated the crime.
