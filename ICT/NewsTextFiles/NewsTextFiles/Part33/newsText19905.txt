
Members of the Jamaican and Caribbean diaspora in Washington, DC last Wednesday received an update on recent developments at the Institute of Jamaica from its executive director, Ann-Marie Bonner.

Bonner, who was in Washington, DC on business and consultations with the Smithsonian Institute, took the opportunity to make the presentation at the Jamaican Embassy.

Bonner emphasised that the Institute, which has been in operation since 1879, will continue with its mission of promoting Jamaican literature, art, and science.

Bonner and the members of the audience were welcomed by Ambassador Stephen Vasciannie, Jamaica’s top envoy to the United States and permanent representative to the Organisation of American States.

Ambassador Vasciannie noted that the Institute had, over the years, helped to record and preserve some of the richness of Jamaican culture, and indicated that the mission was willing to assist the Institute with its efforts in the United States.

The following day, Bonner presented copies of Jamaica Journal, the flagship publication of the Institute of Jamaica, to Ambassador Vasciannie during a courtesy call at the embassy.
