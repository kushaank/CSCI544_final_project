
Honduras is to incarcerate prisoners in government and other public buildings because its infamously violent jails are full to breaking point, the president said Monday.

The Central American country is one of the most dangerous places in the world and has the highest homicide rate at 79 per 100,000 inhabitants.

"We are fitting out some higher-security spots in military facilities and some lower-level ones in other public buildings," President Juan Orlando Hernandez told RHN radio.

Honduras has 24 jails, holding in total almost 13,000 inmates -- nearly twice what they were built to house.

The president said that in his first 100 days in office -- his term started January 27 -- "more than 1,200 criminals have been arrested," forcing special measures to deal with the surging volume in the justice system.
