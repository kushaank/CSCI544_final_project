
A local court here on Monday directed the Sadashivanagar police to investigate the allegations against Energy Minister D K Shivakumar levelled by a woman journalist of Kannada news channel TV9, who along with her colleague had carried out a sting operation against the minister.

Hearing a private complaint by Shwetha, the VII ACMM court observed that the police had not probed the matter properly.

The court directed the police to investigate the allegations against the minister and ascertain his role in the alleged manhandling of two journalists--Shwetha and Shreyas.

Shwetha in the complaint stated that she had included Shivakumarâ€™s name in her complaint, but the police ignored it. Instead of registering a case against the minister, the police registered a case against unknown persons, she added in the complaint.

The police arrested Shwetha and Shreyas on March 11 after their attempt to conduct a sting operation against the minister to expose alleged corrupt practises in his ministry went awry as they were caught by Shivakumar himself.

The police arrested them following a complaint filed by the minister. However, the police delayed in entertaining a complaint by the journalists.

Shwetha moved the court against the police action.
