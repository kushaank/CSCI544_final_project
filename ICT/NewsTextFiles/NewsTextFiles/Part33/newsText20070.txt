
There is a growing push by inflation hawks to get the Fed to raise interest rates. We should recognize that inflation hawks are not willing to rely on honest arguments.

I just watched Alexander Payne's new film Nebraska, written by Bob Nelson and starring Bruce Dern and Will Forte. I don't really know what the writer and director had in mind, but the story is interesting and to me a bit conflicting.

When Dern and Forte stop in Dern's hometown of Hawthorne, we see a place that has been virtually shut down by a dead economy. Most of Dern's rather large family, now old like him, just sit around with their adult children and watch television. As Dern's sister in law "It’s tough for the young folks to find work nowadays."

So, here we have a group of Americans who are all at the bottom of the empire's totem pole, and what do they do? They fight among themselves and hold forth the notion what the elites who run America have taught so well: Every man for himself… PROPERTY RIGHTS!

Number one, we know that under Clinton-Gore the sanctions against Iraq were draconian to say the least. Their Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, when asked by a journalist if after 500,000 children died due to the sanctions, was the price worth it, she responded: "I think this is a very hard choice, but the price, we think the price is worth it."

It is time perhaps for many good and decent Americans to get off their duffs, shut off the boob tube and walk past the tavern. As Chris Hedges so poignantly urges, it is time for citizen protest. Elections are fine and dandy. Now is the time for a push back from this empire to the Main Street America we all cherished.
