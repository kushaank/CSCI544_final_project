
Tom Wolf is one of four people whose name will be on the ballot Tuesday for a chance at the governor’s seat.

Monday, he was joined by fellow democrats, including Mayor Rick Gray, as he toured local businesses in downtown Lancaster; encouraging voters to think fresh.

Wolf will be facing off against fellow democrats Allyson Schwartz, Rob McCord and Katie McGinty in Tuesday’s primary.

He says it’s crucial people exercise their right to vote.

Whichever candidate wins the primary will secure a spot on the November ballot, running against the incumbent, Tom Corbett.
