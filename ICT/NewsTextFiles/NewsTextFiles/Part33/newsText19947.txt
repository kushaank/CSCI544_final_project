
Kenya ’s shilling fell to the lowest in nine months on concern that a spate of attacks in the capital, Nairobi, and the port city of Mombasa may undermine tourism in East Africa ’s biggest economy.

The currency depreciated 0.2 percent to 87.72 per dollar by 5 p.m. local, the weakest level on a closing basis since Aug. 12. The shilling has dropped for five straight days, the longest streak since the period to April 16.

Kenya has faced a growing number of attacks since sending troops to fight Islamist militants in neighboring Somalia in October 2011. On May 16, at least 12 people died and 99 others were injured in twin explosions at a market on the outskirts of Nairobi’s city center. The deaths add to the 54 people who have died nationwide since al-Qaeda-linked militants stormed a Nairobi mall in September and killed at least 67 people.

Tourist arrivals fell to 1.4 million last year from 1.7 million in 2012. Foreign governments including the U.S. and U.K. have this month warned their nationals about elevated security risks in Nairobi and Mombasa .
