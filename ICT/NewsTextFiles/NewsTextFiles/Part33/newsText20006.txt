
PATNA: JD(U) MLAS will meet the Bihar governor on Tuesday and announce the new chief minister of the state after Nitish Kumar remained adamant on not withdrawing his resignation.

Nitish was asked by the JD(U) legislature party to choose the new chief minister, Basisth Narayan Singh, state party chief, said, after the meeting of the JD(U)LP ended.

"Nitish will not be chief minister, but we will continue to work under his direction," he added.

Earlier on Monday, JD(U) president told the media that Nitish Kumar's decision to quit was 'final' and that he took the right decision in the light of the political situation of the country.

"The decision (Nitish Kumar's resignation) is in favour of the nation, the party and Nitishji. It was a difficult decision but is final and right," he said.

On Sunday, amid a high drama no decision could be taken at the two-hour JD(U)LP meeting where MLAs in a chorus demanded that Nitish should stay. Nitish had at that time promised to introspect and reconsider his decision.

Sharad Yadav also made it clear that his party will have no ties with Lalu Prasad's RJD.
