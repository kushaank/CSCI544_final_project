
BJP leader Sushma Swaraj, who is reportedly not on best of terms with Prime Minister-elect Narendra Modi, held a meeting with the Gujarat chief minister Monday. The meeting took place at Gujarat Bhawan, where Modi has been camping since Sunday, sources said.

The former Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha had discussions with Modi soon after holding parleys with BJP President Rajnath Singh at his residence. According to reports Sushma is in the running for a cabinet berth. The MP from Vidisha is keen on a top 4 ministry, but Modi may offer her HRD.
