
LAHORE â€“ Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif on Monday sprang into action against manufacturers of prohibited kite twines after a 28-year-old man was killed by a stray kite string in Lahore.

Rashid, a resident of Gulfishan town of Sheikhupura, lost his life when the kite string fell on him during bike-riding in Badami Bagh area late on Sunday. The victim died on the spot due to profuse bleeding. The incident prompted the chief minister to take the notice.
