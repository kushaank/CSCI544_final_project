
President Park Geun-hye issued a statement on Monday, 34 days after the ferry Sewol sank off the southwestern coast.

She took responsibility for the government's mishandling of the worst maritime disaster in decades, saying, "Ultimate responsibility for the poor response to this incident lies with me." She also offered an apology in her nationally televised address for all the suffering people endured.
