
On average the French embassy  in Qatar grants French citizenship to around 25 people in a year,  Ambassador Jean-Christophe Peaucelle said yesterday.

He was speaking to Gulf Times on the  sidelines of a ceremony at his residence which celebrated the granting  of French citizenship to four people, who originally hailed from  Lebanon, Algeria, Russia and Romania.

Peaucelle said that the new French citizens,  Salima Tami, Alina Mezzi, Valentina Chenviere, M. Fady Bakhos, were a  good example of the diversity and the richness of a common history.

In three of the cases, citizenship was granted because they were married to French citizens.

The fourth person lived in France for a long time and got citizenship mainly because of that reason.

The ambassador explained that there was a way  of becoming a French citizen. One way was by marrying a French citizen,  whereby after some years, you could become a French citizen.  Nonetheless, one of the most important criteria was the ability to speak  French.

“You need to speak French. We do not grant  French citizenship to people who are unable to speak French. At least,  they should be able to manage communicating in the language. We are not  asking for a perfect speaking, but this is important,” Peaucelle said.

In other cases, it was possible for people  who lived or served in France for a long time to apply for citizenship.  In such cases, the office of citizenship in Paris studies the case and  decides.

“We at the embassy receive the application  when someone applies for citizenship. We have an interview with the  applicant and assess the candidate’s motivations. We check whether they  can speak French, then we send the application to Paris [to the Ministry  of Justice,] which studies the case. In some cases, they ask for  further investigations,” the ambassador said.

I agree to receive newsletters from Gulf Times.
