
The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and a local chapter of the Million Mom March filed the lawsuit Monday. It accuses the attorney general’s office of failing to comply with the 2002 law regarding smart guns, the name given to guns that contain technology that only allows them to be fired by their owner.

Under the law, three years after smart guns became available anywhere in the country, all guns sold in New Jersey would have to use the technology.

The lawsuit claims the attorney general hasn’t reported to the governor and legislature every six months on the availability of smart guns, as required by law.
