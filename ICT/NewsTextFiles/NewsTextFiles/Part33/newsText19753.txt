
Mayor Bill de Blasio has demanded two newspapers apologize for their characterizations of his wife’s comments on motherhood.

The Democratic mayor, whose family played a significant role in his election, on Monday called the newspapers’ stories “deeply disturbing” and “offensive” and criticized their “misunderstanding” of the first lady’s remarks.

His wife, Chirlane McCray, told New York magazine in an interview published Sunday that she struggled adjusting to motherhood after the couple’s first child, Chiara, was born.

McCray said she loves her daughter but had been working since she was 14.

“It took a long time for me to get into ‘I’m taking care of kids,’ and what that means,” she said.

On Monday, both city tabloids ran stories about the interview and put McCray’s picture on their front pages.

The Daily News ran a headline of “Didn’t want to be a mom,” which de Blasio said was inaccurate and wasn’t reflected in the magazine piece.

Requests for comments from the Post and the Daily News weren’t immediately returned on Monday.

De Blasio said he thought “a lot of hardworking women in this city are offended” by what they read in the newspapers Monday.

De Blasio, who took office in January, has had rocky relations with the city’s media, particularly the tabloids. The Post, which often has conservative leanings, has frequently attacked the mayor and repeatedly called him Che de Blasio for his leftist leanings. The Daily News, meanwhile, has run a front-page campaign objecting to de Blasio’s plan to ban carriage horses from the city.

De Blasio and McCray celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary last week.
