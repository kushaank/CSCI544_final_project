
TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu has questioned the rationale behind YSR Congress leader Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy meeting Prime Minister-designate Narendra Modi.

“What is the purpose behind the visit? Whose interests the YSR Congress leaders want to protect by meeting Mr. Modi?” he asked. Mr. Naidu, who made snide remarks against Mr. Reddy, however, refused to elaborate when reporters asked him whether he would seek action against the YSRCP leader. Mr. Naidu said he would not blame anyone and firmly believed that the law would take its course.
