
THE Education Ministry has denied reports of a drive to recruit Egyptian teachers.

Egyptian websites had been circulating report that the ministry was planning to hire 805 Egyptian teachers.

A ministry statement said no official recruitment announcement had been made in the Press either in Egypt or any other Arab country, because teaching vacancies are filled primarily from qualified Bahraini applicants.

The ministry has already announced in the local Press about vacancies for the 2014-2015 academic year and has conducted interviews and assessment tests of applicants for these jobs.

Moreover, the ministry annually substitutes qualified Bahrainis to replace expats whose contracts have ended.

The statement pointed out that the ministry usually co-ordinates with Egypt on the possibility of providing the ministry's needs in some disciplines when needed, in order to avoid delays with the start of the school year.

This is usually done through co-ordination with the cultural attach≈Ω of Bahrain in Cairo who receives from the Egyptian Ministry of Education a preliminary list of candidates to be used when the need arises.
