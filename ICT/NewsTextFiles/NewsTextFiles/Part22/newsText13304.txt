
TRAVEL software firm Datalex yesterday reported an 18pc increase in transaction revenue.

The Dublin-based company, whose shareholders include billionaire businessman Dermot Desmond, described its financial position as robust at the end of last year, with net cash reserves of $16.9m (â‚¬12.32m).

Datalex is a provider of E-commerce and retail software solutions to the global travel industry, with customers including JetBlue, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, WestJet, Air China, Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Australia, HP Enterprise Services, SITA and Aer Lingus.

In its interim management statement, the company said it had signed a number of new customers since the start of the year, including Brussels Airlines (a member of the Lufthansa Group) and Air Transat, a Canadian airline.

More customers are expected to sign up by the end of the summer. Datalex also said it would be opening a new office in Beijing, above, in the middle of the year to support existing business in the region.

Company chiefs said the performance to date in 2014 meant they were confident they would meet their plans for 18pc to 20pc earnings growth this year.

"With the new customer deployments currently under way and and the new customer signings to date in 2014, we believe our business is well positioned for sustained growth," the statement said.

Stockbroker Davy said the statement revealed strong growth. "Given its strong first four months of the year, the company is confident that it is on track for full-year adjusted EBITDA growth of 18-20pc," Davy said.
