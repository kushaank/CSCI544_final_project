MANILA, Philippines – Ending 20 years of negotiations, the Philippines and Indonesia will soon sign an agreement to draw a boundary between their overlapping exclusive economic zones (EEZs) in the Mindanao Sea and Celebes Sea.

Described as a triumph for international law, this will make it clear for Filipino and Indonesian fishermen, among others, which parts of the sea they can explore and exploit for resources.

“The conclusion of the negotiations attests to the friendship, patience, goodwill, and commitment of the governments of the Philippines and Indonesia to peacefully address maritime issues,” said Foreign Undersecretary Evan Garcia, who led the Philippine team in negotiations.

In a statement on Monday, May 19, the Philippines' Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) explained that the the two countries have finalized the text of their agreement and the chart on the EEZ boundary.

Philippine Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario and his Indonesian counterpart, Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa, will sign the agreement – the fruit of a series of meetings since June 1994.

The EEZ is an area 200 nautical miles from a coastal state's baselines, or edges, within which the state has the sovereign rights to explore and exploit, and conserve and manage natural resources, among others.

The rules for setting the EEZ boundary can be found in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the same convention that the Philippines invokes in its historic case against China over the disputed West Philippine Sea (South China Sea).

The case between the Philippines and China is different, however.
