
Switzerland has consistently resisted some of the more blatantly progressive-populist-socialist impulses that have gripped many of their continental neighbors — joining the 28-members of the European Union and their unified currency system springs immediately to mind — and the Swiss once again just declined the growing trend to implement their own top-down minimum wage in a national referendum over the weekend.

Swiss voters resoundingly rejected on Sunday a proposed minimum wage that would have been the world’s highest, a move widely seen as reflecting an aversion to state intervention in the liberal economic policies that are the bedrock of Switzerland’s prosperity.

Trade unions had sought a minimum hourly wage of 22 Swiss francs, or $24.65, in what they said was an effort to ensure fair salaries for workers in the lowest-paid sectors, such as retailing and personal services. Switzerland has no national minimum wage.

The Swiss cabinet, known as the Federal Council, and both houses of Parliament urged voters to reject the measure, saying it didn’t take into account regional and sector differences that might merit different pay. They also said the minimum wage would make it more difficult for low- and unskilled job seekers to find work.

Business lobby Swissmem said state control of pay would be a “flawed experiment” with the potential to undermine collective wage agreements in place in most industry sectors. Opponents also said Switzerland’s employment system, which relies heavily on apprentice programs, would be undermined by the minimum wage. The youth unemployment rate in Switzerland is 3%, compared with 23.7% in the surrounding euro zone.

In other words, THE SWISS AREN’T STUPID!

Now, if only we could get people in this country to be even half as smart as the Swiss on economic matters.

This is misleading.

Adjusting to purchasing power parity, $25 in Switzerland are the equivalent to $14 in the USA.

The median hourly wage is about $37 an hour .

The unemployment rate in Switzerland is a ‘whopping’ 3.2% .

The youth unemployment rate in Switzerland is 3%, compared with 23.7% in the surrounding euro zone.

This is misleading.

Which is still way too high for the minimum wage to be anywhere.

Utopia DENIED!

Even more interesting.

Switzerland has also achieved budgetary surplus in every fiscal year since 2006.

…they need more illegal immigrants!

Told you so folks (when this news was first posted here a few weeks ago).

Nor will we buy a new fighter plane (The Grippen).

And in retaliation to the American attacks on our banking system (secrecy) the Swiss people will neither accept to buy American planes (or cars etc) in the future.

That’s the result of an irresponsible obama administration pissing off half the world, including the Swiss citizens.

Switzerland is a REAL democracy : WE THE PEOPLE decide !

It should be noted that in Switzerland, like neighboring France, “liberal economic principles” means liberty of free enterprise, or “laissez-faire” capitalism, where the government stays out of private businesses. “Liberals” in Switzerland do not embrace that government-controlled nanny state that “liberals” in the USA propose.

Alernate headline: Cheer up De Blasio- You still have a shot.

The Swiss went to the Austrian School!

Well then, they must be the Keystone Kops of trade unions. They need to take a lesson or two from the Fabian Socialists running our trade unions and go for incrementalism. They gave the frog a chance to jump out of the pot by going for too much too quickly. You have to lull the populace to sleep first.

The USA has been a ‘melting pot’ for a long time. That metaphor came to usage in the late 19th century. That didn’t stop America from becoming one of the most powerful economic forces in the history of human civilization.

Switzerland is a bit of a melting pot as well. 25% of the population is foreign born. The naturalization rates have been climbing and about 7% of the Swizz citizens are naturalized. Almost 30% of resident foreigners acquire Swiss citizenship. They have 4 official languages. There’s no such thing as a homogeneous religion.

On the other hand, you have countries far more culturally homogeneous than Switzerland with a high government spending/GDP rate (Sweden, Denmark, Finland, etc) and countries with plenty of demographic and cultural diversity like Singapore keeping very low rates of government spending. Or Australia, for example, another melting pot and their government spending/GDP ration is already lower than ours.

In other words, the idea that cultural homogeneity is an explaining factor on this is completely bogus. There’s not even a correlation, let alone a causation. In fact, the standard economic theory is that culturally homogeneous societies tend to be more tolerant of high levels of government spending and welfare.

amazing what a monoculture can accomplish.

That’s what liberalism means in most of the world.

Switzerland and India are smarter than the entire once free world, together.

Much of Europe has reformed their tax-and-spend ways. That’s the great untold story of the last 10 years.

Meanwhile, the U.S. has forfeited its competitive advantage at the same time.

Multicultural countries like the Switzerland, Australia, Singapore, Canada and the US are far less socialist in their economic practices than culturally homogeneous countries like Sweden, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Denmark, etc.

Erika, whatever happened to their vote on a “guaranteed income”? Do you know? I remember hearing a lot about it last Nov./Dec. In particular, news stories always mentioned the vote was “happening soon” but then they never reported the result. I presume it was defeated.

Switzerland is what we could have if we deported everyone that achieved below 1300 on the SAT and only let in those who score 1450 or more on the SAT.

@joana: good post above.

We should copy the swiss in all things. I would trade my passport for a swiss one anyday of the week.

Switzerland, Australia, even Canada–all have realized what it takes to be a successful society: strong property rights, limited immigration, federalism. Only the US thinks that massive 3rd World chain immigration leads to prosperity.

This is misleading.

It’s convenient these two comments follow one another.  Together, they prove that higher wages do not necessarily translate to a higher standard of living.

They also prove that not mandating a minimum wage does not hurt the average worker while also improving the job market.

The one thing that really stuck out to me was the comment about heavy reliance on apprenticeship programs instead of expensive collegiate programs. What happened to learning a trade from a master of it, where you learn what you actually need and gain experience at the same time? Makes a hell of a lot more sense than spending years learning skills irrelevant to any occupation, before starting working while hundreds of thousands of dollars in the hole.

That vote hasn’t happened yet.  Nobody knows when it will happen.

somebody  page coolpubica and give her the bad news. not long ago she was debating the matter vigorously, splaining to the mortals here how Switzerland is this bastion of socialism :)…swizterland, of all countries in europe :)..

Well at least they don’t know chocolate, or weapons.

The question was rhetorical; meant to illustrate my point.

Man those Swiss sure are racist and really hate poor people.

Who knew.

Will my liberal friends still say we should be more like the Swiss? Of course they will, then call me a lair when I mention this vote.

switzerland doesn’t really follow the american conservative-liberal paradigm. It’s characteristics would infuriate both.

Which probably means it is doing something right.

That is actuallly quite accurate about Switzerland.

I have lived on Switzerland periodically for the better half of two decades.

Switzerland is like America with very diverse regions and cultures. You can go from “liberal” french speaking Geneva to ultra-conservative german speaking Appenzell Innerrhoden (which reluctantly gave women the right to vote in 1991!). Most of the country though is very protective of its Swiss identity.

Immigration is a HUGE issue here, but the good guys are winning. The rise of the rightwing Swiss Peoples Party and the recent EU immigration vote are clear symptoms of this.

Unfortunately, I can’t say the same with the US, with worthless RINOs like Boehner & Co pushing for amnesty.

So who actually came up with this?  Obviously there was enough of the PTB over there in order to get it put to a national referendum.

Whoever was behind this will be back.  They won’t be going away.  Socialists never just “fade away”.

Things liberals would hate about Switzerland: no Minimum wage, lower taxation, gun policy, immigration policy, minaret ban, mandatory service.

Things conservatives would hate about Switzerland: Health Care System, Defense spending, Gas Tax, Carbon Tax, gun policy (no conceal carry, gun registry, other restrictions that would never pass here on a national basis), capital punishment banned, assisted suicide legal, nimby-ism which keeps real-estate prices back-breakingly high.

I’ve seen a few swiss articles on HA within the last year or two and most posters wade in to laud swiss economic policy.

However, I also think most of these posters have never lived there for any period of time and I think if they did, 85% would hate it and would want to come back to the US.

The term liberal means “unencumbered by government”, or “at liberty”, the correct classical usage of the word, completely unlike the current American and euro-socialist usage, which means “government regulation against business, and utterly libertine personal behavior”.

After Seattle raises its minimum wage to $15 per hour, maybe all the workers who lose their jobs can move to Switzerland.
