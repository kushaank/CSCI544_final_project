
Chinese state media has stepped-up its propaganda assault against  GlaxoSmithKline, with a leading newspaper accusing the British drugs giant  of evading about £10 million in taxes.

The prominent placement of the article included details that suggest they may  have been leaked from a police investigation into the company’s China  activities that concluded last week.

The article suggested that GSK may come under investigation, rather than the  executives allegedly involved in corruption. That could ultimately threaten  GSK’s ability to operate in China, a market expected to drive growth for the  drugs industry for years to come.
