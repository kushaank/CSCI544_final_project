
Chile exported 59,424 tons of prunes during the 2013/2014 season, which ended in March, to different international markets, the most important of which were Russia, Mexico, Germany, Italy and Poland.

Exports decreased by 23% when compared to the previous year (76,726 tons), a drop that was due to climatic factors that affected the crop.

Andres Rodriguez, executive vice president of Chile Prunes Association, explained through a release note that the country didn't accumulate the necessary chill hours in 2012 and that it had been too hot in spring during flowering, which affected the 2013 crop and resulted in a slight drop.

Russia received 50% less fruit (8,546 tons versus the 17,259 tons it received in the previous season), while exports to Mexico increased by 11%, with a total of 9,011 tons exported compared to 8,084 tons in same period last year.

In the case of Europe, 4,554 tons of dried plums were exported to Germany, 15% less than in the previous season. There were also decreases in the export volumes to Italy and Poland, 35% (2,337 tons) and 27% (4,608 tons) respectively in the 2013/2014 campaign.

However, despite the higher temperatures that affected the 2013 harvest, Chile Prunes Association stressed that the prunes that were exported had a good size and an excellent quality.

"We expected a high harvest in 2014 after having a 23% drop in exports in the 2013/2014 season, however, due to the frosts in Chile, growth was less than expected. Chile has a marketable volume of 63,126 tons, 62,568 from the harvest and 558 tons from carry over, which equates to nearly 56,182 net tons of finished product," added Rodriguez.
