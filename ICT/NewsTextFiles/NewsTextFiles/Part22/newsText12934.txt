
Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall arrived in Nova Scotia, Canada on Sunday for the start of their four-day royal tour.

It was previously feared that the visit abroad would be called off following the death of Camilla's brother Mark Shand last month , however the Duchess put on a brave face as she arrived alongside her husband at Halifax Stanfield International Airport.

Smiling widely, the 66-year-old royal cut an elegant figure as she stepped off the Canadian Forces Airbus plane wearing a cream dress and pale grey Fiona Clare tweed coat. The Duchess accessorised with twin flower brooches and a black clutch bag that was given to her by a Canadian friend when she last visited the country.

Charles and Camilla were greeted by a host of dignitaries and the waiting press, and were given a particularly warm welcome by two young girls. The Duchess was presented with a bouquet of flowers by Molly Jane Lenihan, nine, and her three-year-old sister Grace Elizabeth.

The endearing youngsters had worn matching purple dresses for the special occasion.

While at Government House the Prince of Wales, whose mother the Queen is still Canada's head of state, was appointed to the Privy Council. The swearing-in would have held a special place in Charles' heart as it came 57 years after his father Prince Philip was given the same honour.

The royal couple will travel across three provinces in four days, starting with an official welcome on Monday morning local time. The event will fall on Victoria Day — the country's national holiday to mark Queen Victoria's birthday.

Charles and Camilla will watch military personnel take part in the Grand Parade, after which the Prince will deliver a speech and lay a wreath at a cenotaph outside Halifax City Hall, in memory of those who died in WWI.
