ZURICH--The Swiss government's plan to spend billions on new fighter jets was rejected by voters on Sunday.

A total of 53.4% of Swiss voters weighed in against the purchase of jets from Swedish company Saab AB, according to results reported by Swiss television.

Switzerland's government had long planned to pay 3.1 billion Swiss francs ($3.5 billion) for 22 Gripen fighter jets from Saab. However, opponents of the purchase managed to get it placed before voters in one of the country's regularly held popular referendums this weekend.

Critics of the plan to buy the new jets argued that it was a waste of money for a neutral country that can rely on neighbors to help protect its airspace. Proponents, including the country's military chief, Ueli Maurer, had pitched the purchase as a way for Switzerland to start being able to actively patrol its own skies around the clock.

Currently, the age and condition of Switzerland's fleet of jet fighters limit active air patrol to between about 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, with an hour-and-a-half break for lunch. Switzerland's neighbors are generally able to rely either on their own military to rapidly respond to air threats at all hours, or on assistance from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Switzerland isn't a NATO member, and much of its jet fleet is scheduled to be retired in 2016.

On Sunday, Mr. Maurer said in a statement that the vote result will cause a "security gap." He said various options for ensuring the Swiss military's "operational readiness must be considered in the next few months."

Debate over the plan to buy the Gripen jets grew heated as Sunday's vote drew near, reflecting uncertainty in this country of eight million people about how strongly to back up its famed neutrality with military might.

Saab's involvement in the Gripen vote came under fire earlier this year, when opponents of the purchase argued that the Swedish company was meddling in domestic Swiss affairs by contributing to the "yes" campaign. Saab subsequently pulled 200,000 francs it previously contributed to the Association for a Safe Switzerland, which advocated for the Gripen purchase.

In an interview on Sunday, Saab Chief Executive Hakan Buskhe said the Swiss vote won't force the company to change its financial forecast for this year, or its long-term outlook. Mr. Buskhe said existing agreements to sell the next-generation Gripen jet to the Swedish and Brazilian governments mean that Saab feels "stronger than ever."

"I don't feel that we are losers," the CEO said.
