
Amman, May 18 (Petra) –– Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh on Sunday discussed with member of the Canadian House of Commons and the Canadian Liberal Party, Marc Garneau, developments in the Middle East, including the Palestinian issue and the Syrian crisis.

Judeh and Garneau, who is on a tour of the Middle East, noted the deep Jordanian-Canadian ties and agreed to further cement relations and pursue consultation on various issues of common interest.

Judeh talked about a meeting of the Friends of Syria group of 11 nations, which was held in London on Thursday, and stressed the need for expediting a political solution to the Syrian conflict.

The minister said Jordan, as a host to over 600,000 Syrian refugees, is bearing the huge burden of providing services to the displaced people, urging the world community to live up to its responsibility of assisting the Kingdom in that vital humanitarian endeavour.

Judeh also said the Palestinian cause remained the central regional issue, stressing that failure to find a just and comprehensive solution to it would keep the region and the world in a cycle of insecurity and instability. He said a Palestinian state is a higher Jordanian interest as all final status issues are linked to vital Jordanian interests.

Jordan, he reiterated, backed US Secretary of State John Kerry's efforts to make progress along the negotiating track to arrive at a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian cause.
