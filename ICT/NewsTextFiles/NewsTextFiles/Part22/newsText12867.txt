
The first ships for the contract will be delivered in 2016 and will join Atlantic Towing’s current fleet of eight offshore support vessels in Atlantic Canada. The new contract means 100 new jobs at Atlantic Towing’s offshore fleet home port of St. John’s, NL.

“ExxonMobil has been a valued customer and we are proud and honored to have the opportunity to support the Hibernia and Hebron operations offshore Newfoundland and Labrador with the highest standard of safety and service,” said Wayne Power, Vice President, Atlantic Towing.

The new ships, to be designed and built by Damen Shipyards Group of the Netherlands, will deliver a number of environmental benefits including Clean Design designation with a diesel electric power plant, the latest environmental control equipment, wave piercing bow design, and enhanced crew comfort.
