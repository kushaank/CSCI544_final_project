
Thanks Ira de Silva from London, ONTARIO – CANADA.

I am sure just because Canada did not attend, there were many who support Sri Lanka’s efforts in combatting TERRORISIM & keeping them at bay.

WHAT RIGHT has Canada to dictate terms HOW WE CELLEBRATE our freedom?.   What if OSAMA BEN Laden & his departure is to be scelebrated by Canada, DOES THAT seems right to USA & EU members who faught 9/11 aftermath.

Canada is so obssesed with TAMIL TIGER votes, they will allow now  saying they will FLY the terrorist FLAG in Toronton schools too. This is the PROBLEM by ALLOWING  Tamils to SETTLE in large numbers in the MAIN CITY of Ontario & Canada.
