
In addition, scientists from Defence Research and Development Canada's (DRDC) navigation warfare group provided key scientific and technical support.

GAJT has been developed by Calgary-based NovAtel under an industrial research contract with DRDC.

Canadian Army Land Requirements director colonel Andrew Jayne said the army needs accurate, secure and reliable access to GPS to conduct operations 'throughout the full spectrum of conflict in all potential theatres of operation'.

"With the ever-increasing demands on the electromagnetic spectrum and threat of harmful interference, technologies which contribute to the assurance of position and timing information are a critical enabler of army ... operations in today and tomorrow's operating environment," Jayne said.

"GAJT has been developed by Calgary-based NovAtel under an industrial research contract with DRDC."

DRDC navigation warfare group leader Mike Vinnins said: "GAJT is a great example of a technology with its roots in research that has evolved through years of work into a product that the CAF (Canadian Armed Forces) can use to their advantage."

During testing, the DRDC's data logging equipment was used to record the performance of the LAV III's navigation systems.

DRDC defence scientist Scott McLelland said the move enables the personnel evaluating the test data to visualise the impact of GAJT in jammed and non-jammed environments on the LAV III's recorded position, as it travels along a predefined route.

Developed as part of the Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) innovation programme (BCIP), GAJT is designed to nullify jammers, and provide anti-jam performance to large, multi-component controlled reception pattern antenna (CRPA) systems at lower costs.
