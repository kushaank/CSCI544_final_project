SANTIAGO. Francisco Carela Castro, one of the defendants in the criminal assassination attempt on the lawyer and journalist Jordi Veras, confessed during yesterday's hearing that he and Adriano Roman planned the attempt where Veras was shot in the face as he was entering Channel 25 in June 2010. The attempted assassination of Jordi was planned in the Rafey prison, on orders of the former husband of Miguelina Llaverias, Adriano Roman, according to the statements by Francisco Carela Castro.

In addition to Francisco and Adriano Roman, there are several others in jail with regard to the case. Engels Carela Castro, Roberto Zabala Espinoza, Arturo Jose Ferreras, Franklin Gabriel Reinoso and Candy Caminero are all under preventive custody.

In the middle of his statements, Franicisco Carela Castro asked for pardon from Jordi as well as his family for the harm he caused.

In the meantime, Mario Breton, who acted as a witness in the trial, stated that he served as the intermediary between the killers who attempted to extort three million pesos from Jordi's father, lawyer Negro Veras, in exchange for information regarding the attempted murder, which the jurist refused to pay.

For his part, Negro Veras seemed pleased with the statement of the defendant in the assassination plot, "The reality has started to come out regarding the attempted murder of my son, the country had the right to learn the truth of the incident," said Negro.

Magistrate Annely Torres, the presiding judge of the First Collegiate Tribunal of the Judicial District for Santiago, set for today, Friday, at 10:00 in the morning, the continuation of the trial against the network of killers-for-hire.

The short postponement was due to a petition by the Justice Department because of the absence of a witness in the case. The presiding judge of the tribunal ordered a warrant issued against the witnesses who left the courtroom yesterday.
