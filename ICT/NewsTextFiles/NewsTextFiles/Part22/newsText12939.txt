
Almost 30 revellers were hospitalised at DJ AVICII's gig in Toronto, Canada on Saturday night (17May14).

Fans flocked to the sold-out show at the 20,000-seat Rogers Centre but concertgoers began falling ill before the DJ had even began his set.

According to local reports, 29 fans were taken to hospital suffering from side-effects of alcohol or drug use.

Emergency Medical Services (EMS) commander Peter Rotolo told CTV News, "Unfortunately we have a few kids... excessive alcohol and partying and they can't handle it."

Five people were said to be in a serious condition.

Despite the drama, the show went on as planned, with Avicii taking to Twitter.com after his set to thanks fans for a fun night.
