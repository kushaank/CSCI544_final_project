
An intensive training program in Maskwacis aims to help aspiring aboriginal entrepreneurs this month.

Professor Norman Cornett, a teacher, art critic and the subject of a National Film Board documentary, will give a class of 20 men and women a five-day lesson on creativity in the marketplace, May 26-30.

He said the goal of the Change it Up! program, formed last year by the Classroom Connections learning foundation, is to build bridges between the aboriginal community and the business community.

“What we’re endeavouring here is (for students) to become self-employed, independent, and able to make this work for themselves,” Cornett said.

Students will range in age from 20-42 and they hope to crack into a wide range of industries.

Cornett, who has collaborated with aboriginal artists, activists and chiefs, will bring in aboriginal writer and former Edmonton poet laureate Anna Marie Sewell to share her experiences on the final day of the session.

“Her writings will serve as the catalyst for their creative thinking,” Cornett said.

In January, Classroom Connections launched Change it Up Trades to help unemployed Maskwacis youth get into skilled trades.

Change it Up! pilot projects originated in Chipewayan Prairie First Nation and Montana First Nation.
