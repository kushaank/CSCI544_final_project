Chinese Farmers’ Art got its start in the 1950s when the communist party encouraged rural communities and members of the army to engage in the making of art. Notably, the farmers’ vision of the Communist paradise was straightforward, appealing in both its intensity and insightfulness, a characteristic inherent in the best folk art. In the 1980s as China began to expand its influence worldwide, Chinese Farmers’ Art began to be shown internationally. This is the first time Farmers’ Art is being shown at the United Nations.

Following the exhibition, the works on view will be auctioned off for the benefit of the Farmers’ Art communities.
