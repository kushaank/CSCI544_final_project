
OTTAWA -- Victoria Day celebrations will include a touch of royalty in some parts of Canada, with Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, embarking on a tour of the country that started with their arrival Sunday in Halifax.

Their visit is expected to cost Canadian taxpayers more than $720,000.

Arriving in Halifax on Sunday evening, the pair will spend most of Monday in Nova Scotia by laying a wreath at the cenotaph in Halifax to honour Canadian military service then moving on to visit the local Military Family Resource Centre.

There will also be an official welcoming ceremony outside Halifax's city hall.

They will also visit the historic Pier 21, which welcomed around one million immigrants to Canada and was also the main departure point for hundreds of thousands of soldiers who took part World War II.

"His Royal Highness has been visiting Canada for over 45 years and it is always a delight and an honour to welcome him," Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a statement. "The Prince's knowledge and affection for Canada is exemplified by the work he does here through his charities and the tributes he pays to Canadians who are making a difference in their communities and country.

"It is a privilege for Canada to host The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall as we mark significant events in the lead up to the 150th anniversary of our country. Canadians in Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Manitoba will be delighted to meet with Their Royal Highnesses over the next few days and show their generous affection for the Royal Couple.

"I look forward to meeting with them in Manitoba later this week and wish them a successful tour."

After a brief stop in Nova Scotia's Pictou County, Charles and Camilla will set off for Charlottetown, PEI, to take part in Victoria Day festivities and mark the 150th anniversary of the 1864 conference that opened the door to Canadian Confederation.

Tuesday will see the Royal couple spend most of the day in Charlottetown, including a side-trip by Camilla to the greet students at Immanuel Christian School, before flying to Winnipeg.

Charles and Camilla will spend Wednesday in Winnipeg, meeting business leaders, visiting the Royal Winnipeg Ballet and spending some time with the Queen's Own Rifles regiment.

The cost of the trip includes $150,000 for an unspecified "legacy gift" that Charles and Camilla will receive during their visit.
