In particular, we are concerned by dangerous conduct at sea and intimidation of vessels and by recent mainland events that have resulted in the vandalization of private property.

“Canada encourages both parties concerned to seek an amicable resolution of disputes, in accordance with international law, and to avoid undertaking any confrontational or intimidating actions that would further escalate tensions in the region. We are concerned by actions that may jeopardize freedom of navigation, international trade and maritime security.
