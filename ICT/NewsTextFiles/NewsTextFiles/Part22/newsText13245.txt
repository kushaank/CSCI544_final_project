
WASHINGTON, DC – Uncle Sam is putting out a red alert. And this red alert is about the red army in China.

The Department of Justice unsealed an indictment accusing five members of the Chinese military with hacking into five U.S. nuclear, solar, and steel companies, and a labor union.

The indictment says the Chinese were looking for trade secrets and other sensitive information that would help state-owned businesses.

This is the first time the United States has formally accused employees of another country of committing cyber crimes against U.S. companies or organizations.

The Chinese government , of course, says the indictment is nothing but “fabricated facts”, and has stopped participation in the China-U.S. Cyber Working Group.

Oh, yeah, they also point out that the United States does its own large-scale cyber spying and wiretapping of foreign leaders, companies and individuals, not to mention American citizens.

Bottom line is that everybody hacks. Just don’t bellyache when you’re caught red handed.
