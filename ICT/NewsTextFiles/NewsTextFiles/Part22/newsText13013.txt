
Rain Lõhmus, founder of Hansabank and current shareholder of LHV Pank, says that it is time for Estonians to understand that the country’s current economic structure is not sustainable.

In an interview to Postimees, Lõhmus said that Estonia’s first quarter economic data proved that the Estonian economy was too depent on foreign markets, especially Finland and Swedish, and their specific sectors.

„Until now we have been very proud that we have re-focused our economy from East to West, but it was a long time ago.

Lõhmus said that the Estonian economy key problem is lack of balance and its exposure to risks.

„What happened was that Estonia is focusing on some selected Scandinavian sectors. When these do well, our salaries will be growing and we can build new shopping malls. But when things go badly, we’re in trouble. It’s a very narrow-minded approach,” said the banker.

Lõhmus added that Estonians seem to think that it is the state that must resolve major problems.
