
Former Palgravian Farley McGill Mowat was laid to rest during a private service in Port Hope last week. He had spent most of his 92 years as one of Canada’s most prolific and revered authors despite being once described by the New York Times as “Canada’s angriest young man.” Publicly, I suspect he might have reveled in the description but, privately was anything but an angry young man. He was too creative to be too angry all the time.

All of which raises an interesting question. Not one  of the many obituaries I’ve read about this remarkable Canadian author, whose works have been translated into 52 languages, whose works have sold more than 17 million copies, whose efforts resulted in scores of prestigious accolades including the Leacock Medal for Humour, the Mark Twain Award and the Governor General’s Award for Literature, not one of those obituaries made reference to Farley Mowat’s times in the Caledon wilderness living for a decade in a hand-built cabin which when first hammered together was without running water.

There is a reason why Mr. Mowat’s stone lies along the pathway of the Caledon Walk of Fame. He had risen to national and international prominence while living here, before leaving in 1960, before he bought the boat which led to the award winning book 'The Boat Who Wouldn’t Float,' his humorous account of living in Newfoundland for eight years.

In an interview with the late Toronto Star columnist Gregg Quill two years ago, Mowat lamented the loss of the Canada he’d known saying “his friends had left the stage.” Quill also wrote of Mowat reading a letter to the newspaper praising the author’s writings. “Mowat is tickled pink that his work hasn’t been relegated, like so much of the Canada he loves, to some dusty hole in the collective memory."
