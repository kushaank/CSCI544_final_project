Chinese lenders may boost funding for the $27 billion Yamal       LNG venture to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) from       Russias Arctic if Europe an banks pull out over the       crisis in Ukraine, the head of project partner Total said.

There is a risk of a project delay, due for commercial       operation in 2017, should the political situation worsen, he       said.

Russias annexation of Crimea in Ukraine after       pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted drove       relations with the US and Europe to the lowest since the       Cold War. Totals reliance on Russia to meet growth       targets was thrown into relief by US sanctions against       Russian officials including Gennady Timchenko, a shareholder       of Yamal venture partner OAO Novatek.

Total and Novatek reached a final investment decision in       December, with the Russian company taking 60% of the venture       to produce 16.5 million tpy of LNG, and Total and China       National Petroleum Corp. at 20% each.

Were not affected by financing problems or       embargoes because for the moment there arent any, De Margerie told reporters in Paris after a shareholder       meeting. If there is, then there would be a risk of a       slight slippage. Chinese banks had already agreed to       fund half the project, he said.

Total has said it will stick with plans to raise its stake in       Novatek given Russias large oil and gas resources. The       company also says it will still negotiate a new venture with       OAO Lukoil for unconventional energy projects in Western       Siberia.

Total plans to boost Russian output more than 30-fold over a       decade, partly through Arctic project s, with output reaching as       much as 400,000 bpd of oil equivalent by 2020.
