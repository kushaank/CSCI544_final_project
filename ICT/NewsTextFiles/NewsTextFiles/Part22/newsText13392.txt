
Taipei, May 19 (CNA) A senior defense official said Monday Taiwan will never allow mainland China's military vessels to sail through its territorial waters.

Andrew Hsia, deputy defense minister, told legislators that the Ministry of National Defense has been closely monitoring mainland Chinese navy ships and government vessels and will never allow them to navigate beyond the middle line of the Taiwan Strait.

Hsia made the remarks in response to opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Tsai Huang-liang's comment that a Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) plan may allow Chinese ships to navigate in Taiwan's territorial waters, posing risks to national security.

MOTC earlier in the day said the proposal specifically excludes Chinese military and fishing vessels.

The MOTC statement came in response to a Monday report in the Liberty Times, which said the MOTC's changes to executive regulations would endanger national security by allowing all kinds of Chinese ships to navigate freely in the waters around Taiwan.

The MOTC stressed that the changes would only allow Chinese passenger and cargo ships to navigate through restricted waters, while a ban on military ships and fishing boats will remain in place.

Even if the MOTC agrees to permit Chinese government vessels and navy ships to sail through Taiwan's territorial waters on conditions, Hsia said his ministry will not give its consent.
