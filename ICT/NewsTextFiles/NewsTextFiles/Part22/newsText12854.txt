
The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall started their Canadian tour Monday in Nova Scotia’s capital.

Camilla donned a bright blue gown with the Nova Scotia tartan on it, and Prince Charles was all smiles as he spoke about Canada’s relations to the monarchy.

“Ladies and gentleman, it is the greatest pleasure for us to celebrate Victoria Day with you, it reminds us all about common bonds and common history,” he said.

Halifax local, Carol, said she got to shake the prince’s hand, during his walkabout.

Lucine, a woman who came to the prince’s ceremonial tree-planting in Halifax, said for her, the royal visit is all about fashion.

“An excuse to where my fascinator,” she said.

Prince Charles and Camilla wrap up their Nova Scotia visit Monday evening, moving on to Prince Edward Island on Tuesday, followed by their last stop to Manitoba on Wednesday.
