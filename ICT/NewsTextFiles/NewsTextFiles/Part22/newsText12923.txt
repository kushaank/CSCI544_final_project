A website glitch on Jim Prenticeâs campaign website temporarily exposed the personal information of his supporters on Monday.

The flaw on Prenticeâs site made it possible to learn whether someone had signed up to support the PC leadership hopeful by entering their email address into the splash page at jimprentice.ca. In some cases, it also showed phone numbers and home addresses.

A screen grab forwarded to the Herald of the Wildrose.ca website appeared to show a similar issue â showing a personâs postal code along with an email address.

However, Wildrose Party spokesperson Vitor Marciano said there was no such problem with privacy on his site.

On Monday, both Jim Prenticeâs and the Wildrose Partyâs respective websites were down for hours due to an issue with the website host, NationBuilder. The websites of Toronto mayoral candidates John Tory, David Soknacki, Olivia Chow and Karen Stintz, which are also hosted by NationBuilder, were also affected.

NationBuilder tweeted Monday afternoon that its servers were down due to a denial of service attack, which occurs when a server or website is made unavailable to users by attackers.

Itâs not known if the privacy glitch on Prenticeâs website is related to NationBuilderâs server issues. Representatives of NationBuilder did not respond to requests for comment Monday evening.

Corey Hogan, a PR consultant in Calgary, said he stumbled across the flaw on Prenticeâs site late Monday morning after a friend told him to look at the page. He entered a random email address to get past the splash page, and the next screen displayed the personal information of a woman he didnât know.

Anderson said itâs not yet clear how many peopleâs information could have been exposed by the glitch.
