
A Chinese woman hospitalised a police officer and then accused him of bullying her - before photos from an eyewitness proved otherwise.

Niu Tuan lashed out at traffic officer Zhang Mingtong after he gave her a ticket for illegally parking her car in southern China's Hainan Province.

According to onlookers, 35-year-old Tuan demanded that the officer tear up the ticket after claiming she had been parked for only a minute.

When 43-year-old Mingtong refused to comply she flew into a fit of rage.

Reinforcements were called to the scene to find Tuan, who remained unscathed throughout the incident, asking to make a complaint for assault.

She was taken to the police station but was later forced to admit she was in the wrong after pictures from an eyewitness were given to the authorities and posted online.

After being confronted with the images of the attack Tuan said she had been under a lot of stress.

The officer's colleague Ou Yinglin said that Tuan had slapped, punched and scratched the policeman while screaming throughout the attack.

He explained: "She was pretty hysterical and I am not quite so sure why she decided to just fly off the handle, but my poor colleague who wouldn't hurt a fly was pretty traumatised.

"It was good that somebody managed to take a few snaps because it proved who was the aggressor. I hate to think what would have happened to Zhang if it had just been her word against his."
