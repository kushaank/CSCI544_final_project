
The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall have spent the second day of their royal tour in Canada at a Military Families Resource Centre.

Charles and Camilla were introduced to one of the most unusual line-ups of their royal careers at the centre in Halifax, meeting volunteers dressed up as a banana, a carrot and a bunch of grapes.

Carrot John Marc Morel tells Prince Charles, "I'm all organic, you know!"

The volunteers' costumes were designed to promote healthy eating among children.
