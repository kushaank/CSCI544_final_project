Various financial centers with an orientation to guarding dynastic wealth have signed up to more tax information treaty sharing. Tax chasing governments have simply fuelled another accounting arms race.

Money is perhaps the most hyper-emotive, "uber-thorny" issue of everyday life. Discussion is further impeded by the   economic incoherence of western politicians who have erroneously   preached a doctrine of milk and honey for all through odd   government wheezes, confiscation and sleights of hand. Any   taxation discussions are marked by delusional debates promoting   ever more tax from anybody who has risen above the mean. That is   not to dismiss welfarism - a decent society finds a means to   provide a safety net of support. Alas, things like welfare   spending ends up being organized by governments - who are   singularly ill-suited to handle any cash at all, and certainly   have little, if any role to play in generating wealth through   innovation.

Western governments have spent indiscriminately for 60 years and   the â€˜blobâ€™ needs more cash, (as prudent management   appears anathema to the public sector) leading to ever more   aggressive ways to steal your money . The problem remains that, despite the   political cant, high taxes simply donâ€™t work. Even President â€œCustard Pieâ€� Hollande has somewhat realized this, as   France teeters on the brink of implosion. Remove the incentive to   earn more and people just donâ€™t bother. Hence Britain kills   economic growth at both ends of the scale: aspiring earners reach   top rate tax so quickly it dissolves their motivation, while at   the bottom it can be much more cost effective to stay at home and   bleed the system through benefits. Meanwhile the vast bulk of   (heavily taxed) workers and unemployed are stuck somewhere in   between.

In a desperate quest for more cash to feed Jabba the Hutt-sized   government, offshore banking has come under repeated fire. Facts   are routinely ignored as economic illiterates led by President   Obama rail against the inequity of cash kept offshore beyond   national tax frontiers. A mistaken belief peddled by deranged â€˜hopestersâ€™ like Mr Obama remains that somebody else   will solve governmentâ€™s chronic overspending. True, the   leprechauns / elves / gnomes of the private banking world have a   big pot of cash at the end of the offshore rainbow compared to   ordinary citizens but it is a droplet in the big government   ocean. Arch-taxer Democratic Senator Carl Levin notes that the   entire amount of tax being evaded by US citizens in offshore   accounts amounts to $100 million annually. The US government   borrows more every single hour, 24/7, 365 days a year!

Many economic illiterates make an elementary economic mistake.   Confusing the amount of tax liable (the tax due on interest   accrued) with the total account balance. Whatever way you look at   it, simply closing offshore banking only buys profligate   governments a few minutes more to indulge their spending follies.   (Unless you confiscate the cash of course, at which stage you   become an economic pariah akin to North Korea).

Which brings us neatly to ongoing tax arrangements between   various governments encompassing the west and many major   financial centers. With even Switzerland and Singapore signing up   to share data with American and other authorities, the mainstream   media is happily calling an end to the era of offshore banking.   As always, they are abjectly wrong. True the glamorous tales of   private bankers smuggling diamonds in toothpaste tubes may be a   Manhattan legend now, but private bankers will not die as a   result of high taxes - rather crackdowns provide new revenue   opportunities!

Higher taxation creates an economically nebulous "rentier" class of advisors and accountants, whose job   is not to produce any wealth but merely to use the law to protect   those who donâ€™t feel inclined to give their money back to   serially incompetent politicians. Raise taxes as France did and   capital spews across borders, closely followed by the wealth   creators themselves. Likewise, create more barriers to   individuals having offshore bank accounts and the rich will spend   more on specialist structures such as trusts. Finally, it ought   to be noted that America, in cocooning itself with all manner of   spurious laws to keep tax tabs on its citizens (FATCA et al)   across the world, has only served to further encourage cooperation from Swiss and Singaporean bankers et al. They see   the economic shift, and thus are orienting their services to the   new world in the east where economic growth is key to improving   prosperity, not spending more of other peopleâ€™s money on   unaffordable central government.

He is preaching a false dichotomy between business and government.  Today the reality is a fusion of the State and Big Business.

First, the bankers found that lending to government was the most profitable activity since the State can always find more ways to extract wealth from the people to pay the banks.  Then they gained the monopoly to issue the nation's currency through debt.

Privatisation of government assets has not yielded better results. In fact prices have gone up. Both the public and private sectors have a role t play. One is not better than the other.
