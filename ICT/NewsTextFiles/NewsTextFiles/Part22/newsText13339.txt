Federal prosecutors have charged five Chinese nationals with espionage, trade theft and computer fraud, alleging the defendants hacked into U.S. corporations and stole thousands of documents over the course of eight years.

Among the alleged victims: SolarWorld, the German solar panel maker whose U.S. hub operates out of Hillsboro. An indictment announced Monday says that hackers stole thousands of documents in 2012, when the company was pushing for tariffs on Chinese panels imported into the U.S.

The 56-page indictment spells out how hackers -- using online avatars such as "UglyGorilla" and "WinXYHappy" -- were allegedly able to access troves of information from SolarWorld, the United Steelworkers Union, Alcoa World Alumina, Westinghouse Electric Co., Allegheny Technologies and U.S. Steel Corp.

The document also details what prosecutors contend hackers stood to gain from the thefts, alleged to have occurred from 2006 up to this year.
