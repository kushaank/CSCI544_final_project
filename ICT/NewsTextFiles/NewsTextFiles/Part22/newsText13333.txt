
BEIJING, May 18-- China will suspend some of its plans for bilateral exchanges with Vietnam in response to the deadly violence against Chinese nationals in the country, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Sunday.

Hong Lei made the remarks while commenting on the possible repercussions of the incidents in Vietnam that have left two Chinese nationals dead and more than 100 others injured.

Hong said China has also lifted the level of security warning for Chinese tourists in Vietnam, warning its citizens not to travel to the country.

"The severe violence targeting foreign companies in Vietnam since May 13 has caused casualties and property losses for Chinese nationals. This sabotaged the atmosphere and conditions for bilateral communication and cooperation," the spokesman said.

He added that China will also consider taking further measures according to the situation's development.
