
Washington, May 19 (EFE).- The U.S. government on Monday accused five Chinese military members of a secret unit of hackers of conducting industrial espionage against U.S. firms.

"The range of trade secrets and other sensitive business information stolen in this case is significant and demands an aggressive response," Attorney General Eric Holder said during a press conference to announce the charges.

A federal grand jury in Pittsburgh indicted five People's Liberation Army officers for cyber-attacks on entities including Westinghouse Electric, Alcoa, Allegheny Technologies Incorporated, U.S. Steel, the United Steelworkers Union and SolarWorld.

The 31 charges filed against the Chinese hackers carry maximum prison terms ranging from 10 to 15 years, though it is highly unlikely any of them will ever stand trial.

"The indictment alleges that these PLA officers maintained unauthorized access to victim computers to steal information from those entities that would be useful to their competitors in China, including state-owned enterprises," Holder said.

China reacted to the indictments with outrage.

"The Chinese government, the Chinese military and their relevant personnel have never engaged or participated in cyber theft of trade secrets," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Qin Gang said, calling Washington's accusation "purely ungrounded and absurd."

In addition, Beijing announced the immediate suspension of the activities of the China-U.S. Cyber Working Group, established last year.
