A total of 44 cities saw month-on-month price gains in new home prices last month, down from 56 for March and 57 for February, the NBS data showed. Among the 44 cities with rising new home prices, growth decelerated in 31 last month.

The average month-on-month price increase for new homes slowed notably to 0.1 percent last month from 0.3 percent in March. The biggest month-on-month price increase was recorded in the South coastal city of Xiamen, which rose 0.4 percent month on month from March.

Hangzhou, in East China's Zhejiang province, saw its new home price dropping the most of the 70 cities, down by 0.7 percent from March.

The other seven cities with month-on-month declines in new home prices were Ningbo, Wuxi, Wenzhou, Jinhua, Anqing, Ganzhou and Huizhou.

For existing homes, prices increased in 35 cities month on month in April, notably down from 42 cities in March and from 46 in February, according to the statement.
