The December 2013 blog post asserts that China’s “century of humiliation” beginning with the Opium War , and previous conquest of the empire by the likes of the Mongols and the Manchu , happened not because China was “backward,” but because it was corrupt and poorly governed.  Mingjing News republished the post [Chinese] on May 16.

CDT collects directives from a variety of sources and checks them against official Chinese media reports to confirm their implementation.

Since directives are sometimes communicated orally to journalists and editors, who then leak them online, the wording published here may not be exact. The date given may indicate when the directive was leaked, rather than when it was issued. CDT does its utmost to verify dates and wording, but also takes precautions to protect the source.
