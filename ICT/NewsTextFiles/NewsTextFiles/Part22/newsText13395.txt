WASHINGTON - The United States has brought first-of-its kind cyber-espionage charges against five Chinese military officials accused of hacking into U.S. companies to gain trade secrets.

The indictment accuses the hackers of targeting the U.S. nuclear power, metals and solar products industries. The alleged victims are brand-name companies including Alcoa and Westinghouse.

The indictment includes allegations of trade secret theft and economic espionage.

Attorney General Eric Holder and other federal law enforcement officials were announcing the indictments later Monday. Holder says in a statement that the U.S. will not tolerate foreign government efforts to sabotage American companies.
