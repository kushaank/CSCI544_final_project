GRAND RAPIDS, MI - City High Middle school has been ranked the 21st most challenging high school in the Midwest by the Washington Post, Grand Rapids Public Schools leaders announced Monday, May 19.

The school was the only West Michigan traditional public school to place in the top 25. Grand River Preparatory High School , a Kentwood charter school, placed sixth out of the 257 Midwest schools rated.

The Washington Post recently ranked the nation’s top public high schools on its list of “America’s Most Challenging High Schools” nationally, by region and by state. Only 2,063 schools out of over 20,000 U.S. public High schools earned placement on the Post's 2014 National High School Challenge Index.

America’s Most Challenging High Schools ranks schools through an index formula that is a simple ratio -  the number of Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate and Advanced International Certificate of Education tests given at a school each year, divided by the number of seniors who graduated that year.

City High ranked fourth in the state and 256th nationally. Grand River Prep ranked third in the state and 84th nationally. Three other Kent and Ottawa county high schools were ranked among the top 25 in the state: Black River charter school (5th in the state and 318th nationally), East Grand Rapids (11th in the state, 761st nationally), and Lowell (16th in the state and 953rd nationally).

City, located at 1720 Plainfield Ave. NE, is an International Baccalaureate Middle Years and Diploma Programme.

Utica Academy for International Studies in Sterling Heights was first in the state, second in the Midwest and 69th nationally.
