The Saskatchewan Teachersâ€™ Federation (STF) and the Government-Trustee Bargaining Committee have reached a tentative collective bargaining agreement.

The pact includes a total compensation increase of 7.3 per cent over four years, as well as a $700 pro-rated payment in the first year. There will be funding for teachers in years three and four, in recognition of associated fees, upon the establishment of a new teacher regulatory and disciplinary body in Saskatchewan.

The agreement deals with articles that are required by legislation to be bargained provincially by the committee and the STF. A commitment has also been made to address other important matters that fall outside of the agreement and bargaining process, including issues such as student and teacher time, and developing a common understanding of the expectations put upon teachers.

The two sides had a tentative agreement last fall, but teachers voted 73 per cent against the deal.
