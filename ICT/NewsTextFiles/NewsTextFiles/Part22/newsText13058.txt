
On May 23, the Chilean director Alejandro Jodorowsky will release his first film in over two decades: The Dance of Reality, an autobiographical movie shot in the directorâ€™s own hometown.

Though the film was based on his own experiences, Jodorowsky relies heavily on metaphor and myth to tell the story of his childhood, as seen through the lens of his belief that reality is created by the imagination.

An exclusive sneak-peek clip from the film can be seen here.
