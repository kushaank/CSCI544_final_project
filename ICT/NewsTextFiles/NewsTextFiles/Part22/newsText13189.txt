
Chester County Commissioner Terence Farrell is on his way back to the United States Monday after travelling in China for the past week.

Farrell travelled there to submit a �friendship agreement� to a municipality there in hopes of fostering business and economic development opportunities for the county in the future.

He has sent occasional dispatches about his travel and experiences from the road.

The following submission was sent Sunday evening Eastern Daylight Time, after Farrell flew from Chongqing to the capital of Beijing.

�On Friday, I signed the friendship and sister municipalities agreement with the mayor of Yongchuan District, one of 38 districts in the province of Chongqing. After much research by the Chinese, Yongchuan was chosen as the sister municipality for Chester County because of a perceived compatibility, particularly in the area of economic development.

�The agreement, which was ratified by the Board of Commissioners before my departure, is basically a statement of intent to further pursue �friendly exchanges, work together cooperatively to promote the cultural awareness, prosperity and development of both� municipalities.

�It was a BIG DEAL, and the Chinese officials pulled out all the stops to show its importance to them. I was given a tour of the city and environs, had a front row seat at the celebration of their annual tea festival, and had a place on the stage at their 4th annual Investment and Trade Fair.

�Before the actual signing ceremony, I spent an hour in �heartfelt and candid conversations,� as they would later be described to a general audience, with about 10 government and trade officials, each of us expressing our intent to continue to develop our relationship.

�In addition to Mayor Feng, the officials most notably included the Party Secretary of Yongchuan, Mr. Xiong. In China, it gets no better than that!

�After the ceremony, I was taken out to dinner at a top-quality restaurant where I was persuaded to try many foods for the first time, and in the Chinese tradition, offer and receive toasts throughout the meal. It is a day and night I will always treasure.

�When I return, we will roll up our sleeves and begin the hard work of developing specifics in fulfillment of the agreement. We have already begun discussions with the Chester County Chambers of Business and Industry and the Chester County Economic Development Council about taking a delegation back to China, Chongqing, and Yongchuan this fall to explore the possibilities.

�On Saturday, I flew to Beijing. I was met at the airport by Chinese friends. There was a brief moment of anxiety when I emerged from baggage claim, clearly marked in both Chinese and English, and did not see them. Thank God for cell phones! Mine works in China and we were soon united and on our way.

�Lots of traffic! An American style dinner that night (steak!), and a visit to the Forbidden City and the Summer Palace on Sunday. I can�t even begin to describe the vastness and luxuriousness of residences built for the Emperors 600-plus and 300-plus years ago. They are indeed cities, and even the many pictures I took do not do them justice.
