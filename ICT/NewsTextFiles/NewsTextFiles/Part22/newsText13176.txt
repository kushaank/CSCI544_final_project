
BEIJING and DALLAS, May 19, 2014 /PRNewswire/ Century Bridge Capital announced today that it has invested $60 million in two joint venture real estate developments for middle-income, residential projects in Zhongshan and Wuxi, China.

Commenting on the investments Century Bridge CEO, Tom Delatour, noted, "The two investments are consistent with our established strategy and reflect the characteristics we believe are essential for successful joint venture residential developments in Tier 2 and 3 cities in China. Both are in-fill sites located in vibrant submarkets within cities experiencing dynamic economic expansion. Like all the markets we target, they are also experiencing increasing levels of affordability, with annual disposable income growth exceeding home price growth. In addition to benefiting from adjacent infrastructure and accessible amenities, the projects themselves are designed to meet the needs of middle class buyers in these areas. As is the case with the underwriting of urban real estate developments globally, where market conditions vary from region to region, country to country, city to city and submarket to submarket within individual cities, understanding and documenting the trends, local economics and purchaser profiles on a submarket basis is critical. Both the Zhongshan and Wuxi investments are based on a rigorous assessment of these factors."

Wuxi Major city at forefront of China's transition to higher value-added production and manufacturing. Foreign companies include General Electric, Bosch and Siemens.

Established In-fill Location In Xidong New City, a growing neighborhood of 150,000 residents, in the Xishan Industrial District of Wuxi, adjacent to the Wuxi East High-Speed Train Station with close proximity to educational resources, retail amenities, local subway transportation as well as hospital facilities.

Jingrui Holdings, apart from developing in Shanghai, has primarily focused on projects in Tier 2 and3 cities. As a Hong-Kong listed national developer with more than 20 years experience, their history of success and level of expertise in these markets makes them an ideal partner for us."

Its core group of real estate professionals have deep roots in the city and have demonstrated success with a variety of projects in the local market."

With 100 million people expected to relocate to China's cities by 2020, China's ongoing urbanization and infrastructure needs will continue to drive growth in the Tier 2 and 3 cities. Century Bridge Capital believes that this dynamic bodes well for continuing stability and investment opportunity in middle-class housing in solid submarkets within China's Tier 2 and 3 cities.
