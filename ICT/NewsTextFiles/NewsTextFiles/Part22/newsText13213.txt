Two Chinese men working at a controversial China-backed copper mine in Myanmar have been kidnapped by activists and monks who have threatened to kill them.

According to the Wanbao Mining Company three workers from a sub-contractor, two Chinese men and a Burmese national were taken on Sunday morning.

The firm is calling for the immediate release of the men, who were surveying a southern area of the mine project when they were set upon by activists and two local monks.

The Burmese man was later released, and that evening the two Chinese men were apparently beaten and threats made to kill them if work on the copper mine isn't halted.

"Wanbao vehemently condemns this unprovoked attack on our colleagues," Wanbao Mining Company said in a statement.

The firm says the activists, who claimed to be from a group called the "Student Network of Mandalay", had issued a number of demands and threats.

A spokesman for the company and local officials confirmed the incident.

"We strongly urge that our two colleagues be released soon," said Wanbao official Cao Densheng, adding that the company had asked for help from authorities in Sagaing Division, north-western Myanmar.

The mine has met with virulent protest from campaigners and local villagers who have raised concerned about its environmental impact and land-grabbing.
