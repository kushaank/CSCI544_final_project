
Vietnam is sympathetic toward Taiwanese and other foreign investors whose businesses have been affected by anti-China rioting in the country and has promised to help them resume production, Vietnamese government officials said in Hanoi on Saturday evening.

Do Nhat Hoang, chief of Vietnam's Bureau for Management of Foreign Investment under the Ministry of Planning and Investment, said at a press briefing that the damage to Taiwanese and other foreign companies had occurred as result of misunderstandings and provocation by lawless individuals.

Vietnamese authorities are sympathetic toward those investors and are taking appropriate measures to assist them in restarting production, Do Nhat Hoang said in response to questions by officials of Taiwan's Representative Office in Hanoi.

At the briefing hosted by Vietnam's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, assistant foreign minister Dang Minh Khoi said his government relies on the contributions of investors from Taiwan, China and other countries and has adopted a clear position on the riots.

Vietnam's prime minister Nguyen Tan Dung, meanwhile, has instituted four orders, allowing government agencies to take the necessary steps to ensure social order, security, a sound investment environment and the safety of all foreign investors, Dang said.

Last week, anti-China riots were held across the Southeast Asian country in response to a Chinese oil-drilling venture in an area of the South China Sea that is also claimed by Hanoi. According to China's official Xinhua new agency, two Chinese nationals were killed and more than 100 others injured in the violence.
