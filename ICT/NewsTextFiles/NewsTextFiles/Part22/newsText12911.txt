
A Finnair flight bound for New York from Helsinki was forced to land in Halifax, Canada Sunday night. The flight, AY 005, was grounded by a technical fault and is still on the ground, the airline says.

National carrier Finnair said that the pilot reported losing power in one of the planeâ€™s engines, following which the motor shut down completely. Airline officials say they have no information on how long it will take to identify and repair the fault.

Communications chief Arja Suominen confirmed that the pilot lost power in one of the engines forcing the plane into an unscheduled landing, although she said it is possible to fly the aircraft with one engine.

Suominen said however that for safety reasons pilots usually land their craft at the nearest airport in these kinds of situations.

Finnair later announced Monday that it was forced to cancel the return flight as the aircraft remains grounded in Canada awaiting parts for the repair.

The plane was carrying 245 passengers who were put up at a hotel near the airport overnight. Checks with Finnair Monday afternoon revealed that the plane -- and its passengers -- might not get airborne until Tuesday.
