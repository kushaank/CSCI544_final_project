
Royal Caribbean announced today when it sends its newest cruise ship, Quantum of the Seas, to China in 2015, it will do so as part of an epic 53-night journey.

Starting on May 2, 2015, Quantum of the Seas will depart the New York City area and head to Shanghai (Baoshan), China and stop at some of the most cosmopolitan cities along the way.

The Quantum Global Odyssey goes on sale to Royal Caribbean Crown and Anchor Society members first on May 20, 2014 and to the general public on May 22.

If 53-nights is a bit too much, you can also choose from five other mini-sailings built into the 53-night affair, ranging from three to 16 nights.

I understand I will be contacted by MEI Travel regarding booking a Royal Caribbean cruise and am interested in booking a cruise.
