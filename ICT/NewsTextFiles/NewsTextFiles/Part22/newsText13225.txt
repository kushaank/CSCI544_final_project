
  Cantonese opera virtuosi to perform in new production "Investigation to Redress a Wrong"

Hong Kong (HKSAR) - A new Cantonese opera, "Investigation to Redress a Wrong", one of the attractions of the "Chinese Opera Festival" presented by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, will be staged in early July. The new production is written in the traditional paichang (formulaic) style by Sun Kim-long, a well-known actor of the genre in Hong Kong. The cast includes Lee Lung, Lung Koon-tin, Wong Chiu-kwan, Lui Hung-kwong, Wan Yuk-yue, Lai Yiu-wai, Cheng Nga-ki and Sun Kim-long himself.

Paichang plays, or formulaic plays, are an important part of Cantonese opera.

Paichang's components include special percussive points, set tunes and characters, plots, and stylised movements. In the olden days, a paichang opera was often the brainchild of the impresario's assistant, who would pick out certain pieces to form one production. These formed the basis for what became the traditional Cantonese opera repertory as it is known today.

"Investigation to Redress a Wrong" follows the traditional paichang form and is therefore made up of segments such as "The Battle", "Seeing the Wife", "Reading the Petition", "Searching the Palace" and others.

The story follows Prince Gong, who runs into a gang of robbers while on a hunt and is rescued by Wang Yingcai and Wenyong, who become the Prince's new recruits. The ambitious Wenyong fawns over the Prince and becomes his godson, while Yingcai is despatched to Shanxi as a general.

Wenyong has long harboured lascivious desires for Yingcai's wife, nÃ©e He, and on the pretext of seeing Yingcai off, pushes him into a river. Wenyong then visits the Wang family home, makes advances towards Madam He and injures Wang's father in a fight. Family members flee and Wang's father later dies from his injuries.

The county prefect, who happens to be on an inspection round, takes up the case, but when he confronts Wenyong is killed in the family home. Madam He flees amid the confusion. Meanwhile, Yingcai has luckily escaped death, and on his way home, rescues his drowning wife who has thrown herself into the river in desperation.

The two file a complaint with the Imperial Commissioner, Prince Pingnan, who is on an official visit. However, Prince Gong wants to cover up for Wenyong, so Prince Pingnan sends Yingcai to search Prince Gong's palace armed with the gold tablet bestowed on him by the late Emperor, that gives him authority to override any other orders or ranks. Wenyong is found hiding underground.

Yingcai's wrong is redressed and the family is re-united.

"Investigation to Redress a Wrong" will be staged at 7.30pm from July 4 to 6 (Friday to Sunday) at the Theatre, Ko Shan Theatre.
