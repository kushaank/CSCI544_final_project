
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Senior Chinese official Wang Qishan has told the country's discipline inspection organs to be "strict, specific and genuine" when investigating officials.

Wang, chief of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), made the remarks on Monday at a symposium on the work of discipline inspection departments.

Wang urged disciplinary officials to improve their work methods and styles and shoulder responsibilities to uphold laws and regulations and resolutely stem the spread of corruption.

"More specific the responsibilities, more effective the work. The reform and innovation of discipline inspection should focus on uncovering officials' misconduct and enforce punishments for them," Wang said.

The senior official stressed that disciplinary officials should retain a firm belief in the Party and abide by the law.
