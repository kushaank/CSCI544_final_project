
Some 135 Chinese workers who were injured in the anti-China riots in Vietnam's central Ha Tinh province have been flown home Sunday morning, a Chinese embassy official said.

Qi Xiaofeng, the spokesperson of the Chinese embassy in Vietnam, told Xinhua that 135 wounded Chinese workers had been sent back home by two flights from China Southern Airlines and bound for southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu.

Two Chinese nationals have been killed and more than 100 others injured in the deadly anti-China riots starting in Vietnam last week.

China's Foreign Ministry said early Sunday that more than 3,000 Chinese nationals had been evacuated from Vietnam as of Saturday afternoon.

The deadly attacks against Chinese personnel and companies in Vietnam happened after China frustrated a series of provocative moves by Hanoi to disturb the normal drilling of a Chinese oil rig in the South China Sea.

The Chinese Transport Ministry said China is also sending five ships to Vietnam on Sunday to evacuate its nationals.
