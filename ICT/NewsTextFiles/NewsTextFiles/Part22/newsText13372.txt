
China has evacuated more than 3,000 citizens from Vietnam amid growing fears of an impending conflict between the two countries. In addition, Beijing is sending five ships to evacuate any more nationals from the country, China's state-run media reported. Two Chinese people have been killed and dozens more injured in a dispute over a Chinese oil rig in disputed waters. Anti-China protests were held in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City this weekend. Mobs have also set fire to foreign-owned factories, according to CNN. The trouble has been triggered by China's decision to move the Haiyang Shiyou 981 oil rig to disputed territory in the South China Sea. The rig is just 150 miles from Vietnam's coast.
