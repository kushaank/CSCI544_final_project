United Nations:Â  UN officials say Lebanon is desperate for help as tens of thousands of refugees from neighboring Syria continue to stream into the small country. It is projected to have 1.5 million refugees by the end of this year.

That's one third of Lebanon's population of 4.5 million.

UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Monday that over a million Syrian refugees are registered in Lebanon, and 50,000 new refugees continue to sign up with UN agencies each month.

In Geneva earlier, the U.N.'s humanitarian chief in Lebanon, Ross Mountain, told reporters that at this rate, Lebanon will be home to 1.5 million refugees by year's end.

Unlike Turkey and Jordan, Lebanon has no camps and the Syrians are scattered all over the country in informal settlements, living with relatives or renting homes.
