
Yesterday Switzerland said no in a referendum to buying 22 JAS Gripen fighter planes from Sweden. After almost ten years of efforts to make it happen, the deal has been called off by the Swiss voters.  So where does this leave the Swedish project - and who will foot the bill? That is what we are going to talk about with aviation-journalist Christer Åström.

Swedish defence minister Karin Enström regrets the results of the Swiss referendum. But the Green party wants the deal cut short.

"It is unfortunate, we've seen great advantages from the cooperation with Switzerland, and this cooperation would have been beneficial for both Switzerland and Sweden."

Despite the Swiss no, nothing has changed with regards to Sweden's need to continue development on Jas Gripen over the course of the next decade, Enström stresses.

There is a need to improve Swedish air defence, especially in light of recent development in and around Ukraine, and continued development of the Gripen system is the most cost efficient alternative, she told news agency TT.

Advocates of the Gripen deal are now looking to Brazil to secure a much needed partnership. Talks are underway and the final agreement is expected to be signed in December.

But further delay in securing a partner by the end of 2014 might mean that the Swedish deal turns out more expensive than planned, according to the Green party, who would rather see the deal cut short. A deal with Brazil is still far away, according to the party's spokesperson on defence issues.

The Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society (SPAS), welcomed the results of the Swiss referendum.

"This isn't just a no to Jas Gripen, but above all a no to extensive weapons investments," SPAS chairwoman Anna Ek told news agency TT.
