A congested and sometimes dangerous strip of U.S. 70 through James City is faring well in the N.C. Department of Transportation’s new Strategic Mobility Formula, with $113.7 million in state funding designated to make it safer by 2021.

That information was released this week along with data for 3,100 projects based on criteria contained in the new formula, including 500 new highway projects and 1,300 multi-modal projects.

All of the projects would cost a total of $70 billion in today’s dollars to complete but it was the scoring formula prioritizing them.

Tata was keynote speaker this week at a North Carolina Association of Metropolitan Planning Organizations convention in Wilmington attended by New Bern MPO representatives including Craven County Commissioner Steve Tyson, Craven Assistant County Manager Gene Hodges and New Bern MPO Administrator Maurizia Chapman and Jeff Ruggieri, New Bern development director.

Tata said the data show that based on current funding levels work on at least 370 projects could be scheduled during the next decade, more than double the number of projects DOT would have expected to schedule under the old formula for a 10-year period.

Both Tyson and Hodges, and Craven County Manager Jack Veit, who got similar information at a Highway 70 Corridor Commission meeting in Kinston on Thursday, said the chart shows scores for the James City section of U.S. 70 very high in every category compared to projects in locations elsewhere the state.

The $113.74 million is described as going to fund a $66 million Neuse River Bridge to Grantham Road section expansion and overpasses with exit ramps at Williams Road and Airport Road at $23.74 million each.

Tata said that the majority of the projects would occur at the local level, pending local input, and that NCDOT could do about 91 highway and aviation projects in the next 10 years on the statewide level with the 40 percent allocation provided under the new funding formula to address issues such as congestion.

These projects will make it easier for people to access job centers, education centers and health care centers while helping businesses more efficiently transport products through bigger cities to other parts of the state.

NCDOT will also move forward with an 108 additional major transition projects which were grandfathered in and not subject to STI, like the Slocum Gate project in Havelock.

Sixty percent of available funding is directed to projects at the regional and division levels. The remaining 40 percent goes to projects addressing statewide needs. The new formula is data-driven to increase transparency and minimize subjectivity in the project selection process.

A 90-day period beginning June 2 allows for public feedback on the newly released data during which MPO’s, Rural Planning Organizations and division engineers in the 14 transportation divisions assign their points to the projects.

NCDOT then combines the scores calculated by MPO/RPO members and division engineers to generate the total number of local input points for regional and division level projects which department officials rank after also figuring in project logistics.

Final project rankings generated by the new formula create the next State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) on which the public may also comment beginning in December 2014. It will be adopted by the N.C. Board of Transportation in June 2015.
