Nuance has opened its first Timebox store, a newly-developed fashion watches and jewellery store at Zurich airport.

Nuance’s head of Speciality EMEA,Nina Pan said the concept had been worked since June 2012 and would be rolled to other locations.

“When we kicked off this project, we dedicated a lot of resources to customer behaviour understanding, industry benchmarks and workshops with our key brand partners and design agency to get the best ideas on board. We’ve gone back to the drawing board time and time again to get it right, and the final result is stunning,” she said.

The store will offer a range of entry and mid-priced level watches both from international and Swiss-based brands, including Calvin Klein, Michael Kors, Emporio Armani, DKNY, Guess, Diesel, Police, Certina, Victorinox, Swiss Military, Mondaine, Luminox, Hanowa, Cover, Wenger, Candino and Jowissa.
