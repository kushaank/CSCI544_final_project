
China is ready to import agricultural products from Kyrgyzstan, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the KR Erlan Abdyldayev said today to journalists.

According to him, the KR has a certain imbalance in trade with China. "We are importing more than exporting to China. The problem we have set ourselves the Chinese party for the past few years. It was sympathetic. The day before the President of China said about readiness to encourage imports of industrial and agricultural goods from Kyrgyzstan. China is ready to open its market for us. First of all they would like to import the crop and livestock production. We signed an agreement on plant quarantine. This is the basic document to enter the Chinese market," the Minister said.

"I hope that we can offer high quality industrial products. China is willing to increase their imports from Kyrgyzstan. It is very important to us. Today, according to our estimates, the turnover of $1.5 billion, we import 95 percent, and only 5 percent is exported. Large imbalances occur," Erlan Abdyldayev said.
