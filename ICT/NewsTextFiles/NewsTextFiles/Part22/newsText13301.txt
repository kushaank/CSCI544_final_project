
CLEVELAND (AP) â€” The chief financial officer of a northeast Ohio telemarketing firm has agreed to cooperate in a case involving allegations that the company funneled illegal campaign contributions to two candidates.

Michael Giorgio of the North Canton-based Suarez Corporation Industries has pleaded guilty to seven counts, including conspiracy to commit campaign fraud and illegal corporate contributions.

The charges involve contributions made in the name of Suarez employees that prosecutors say Giorgio and company owner Ben Suarez actually made.

Giorgio's attorneys could not be immediately reached Monday.

Giorgio and Suarez had been scheduled for trial June 2 in Cleveland. The two men are accused of funneling about $100,000 each to the 2012 campaigns of U.S. Rep. James Renacci and unsuccessful U.S. Senate candidate Josh Mandel.
