As markets go, China is probably the closest it gets to being a paradise for car makers. Yet as a recent survey suggests, the country is becoming much more than just a place to sell cars. Chinese car buyers are at the forefront of a number of global trends that could shape how autos are sold—and used—worldwide.

The report from consultancy Capgemini, which surveyed 10,000 consumers around the world, found that Chinese consumers lead the pack for turning to social media—either to seek or give guidance–about cars. In China, 97% of respondents said they post, or intend to post, their vehicle experience to social media—much higher than the global score of 76% and ahead of other emerging markets such as India (91%) and Indonesia (94%).

When it comes to the willingness to buy a car online, the Middle Kingdom is also tops, with 61% of buyers here saying would be likely or very likely to purchase a car on the Internet. By contrast, only 28% of British consumers gave the same response.

This willingness to shop online for cars in China also suggests a greater openness to look past official dealers to so-called “nontraditional sellers” including department stores, online vendors or buying from manufacturers directly.

While in the U.S. around one-third of consumers said they would only buy from a dealer, in China that figure was just 14%. Perhaps of greater note to car sellers, Chinese appear especially keen to consider alternatives to direct car ownership.

While only around 40% of respondents around the world said they would consider shared ownership in the form of car pooling with other drivers, in China that figure was 68%–ahead of 59% in India and 50% in Indonesia.

Similarly, interest in the concept of “mobility packages”–where drivers purchase access to a car, accessories and servicing for a fixed price and for a predetermined period—was greatest among Chinese buyers at 68%, ahead of those in India at 67% and Indonesia at 61%.

Auto makers take note—a global transformation is taking place in how people buy and use cars and it’s taking root in China first.
