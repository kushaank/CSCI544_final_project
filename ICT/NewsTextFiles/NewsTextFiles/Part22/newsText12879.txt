
The search for a former Lunenburg man who moved to Saskatoon and went missing in February during his stag party there might be over.

On Saturday, a group of marine researchers working on the South Saskatchewan River found the remains of a male near the Wapiti Valley Regional Park, about 220 kilometres northeast of Saskatoon.

Media reports from Saskatchewan indicate the family of Gregory Myles MacIntosh has been alerted that the remains could be his. An autopsy is set for Tuesday.

Saskatchewan RCMP spokesman Sgt. Craig Cleary would not discuss the identity of the remains until that information is fully known.

“We definitely want to be 100 per cent positive on the identity before we speak to that,” he said.

Cleary had no comment when asked if the body had any identifying information. He said if the autopsy results are inconclusive, DNA testing could take months to verify the identity.

A Facebook page called Bring Myles Home said Saskatoon police called family members with the news on Sunday.

Originally from Lunenburg, MacIntosh, 28, was going to be married within two weeks of the party, which was held during the first weekend in February. He was last seen around midnight on a Saturday. After a disturbance of some sort, MacIntosh was asked to leave a bar and he then boarded a party bus going to another bar.

Police believe there was an altercation on the bus and MacIntosh got off and walked away before police arrived. Another man from the bus was subsequently charged with aggravated assault.

Some blood was later found on ice in the South Saskatchewan River and testing confirmed it was MacIntosh’s.
