
Beijing: China has proposed to accelerate the establishment of the Free Trade Area of Asia-Pacific at a meeting of economic officials from the Asia Pacific region in east Chinaâ€™s port city of Qingdao.

Sun Yuanjing, an official in charge of trade affairs under the Ministry of Commerce, made the proposal at a two-day gathering of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, officials.

Sun said Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation first formally started discussing the concept of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific at its summit in 2006, and China now wants to give the process another boost.

Sun noted that it could still take a while before the negotiations on the free trade area get started.

The official also said the envisaged free trade area will cover, rather than contradict, other free trade arrangements in the Asia Pacific region, like the US-proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership.
