
BEIJING—China has criticized the top official of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations for saying Beijing intruded in Vietnamese territory, and a Chinese official has demanded the group stay out of the dispute.

A foreign ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, said the ASEAN secretary-general was sending “wrong signals” about the dispute over China’s deployment of an oil rig to disputed waters in the South China Sea.

The secretary-general, Le Luong Minh, who is Vietnamese, told The Wall Street Journal on Friday that “we have to get China out of the territorial waters of” Vietnam.
