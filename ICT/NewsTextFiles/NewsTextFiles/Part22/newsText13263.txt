
One of the best things about Ocean City is that some things never change. Families visit the same restaurants, year after year. Kids experience the same rides their parents rode when they were kids. The wild horses of Assateague stay wild and the gorgeous ocean view never wavers.

But even the most stalwart lovers of tradition enjoy something fresh once in a while. This summer, thanks to tons of openings and events, both veteran beachgoers and O.C. newbies will find plenty that's new to love in and around Ocean City .

Everyone has their favorite beach restaurants and bars – but it's fun to try new spots, too. This year, there are plenty of new places opening – and some major renovations to old favorites – making it easy to add a little variety to your dining schedule.
