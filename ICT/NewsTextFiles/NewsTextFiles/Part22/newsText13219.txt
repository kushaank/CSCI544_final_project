
When a cheap smartphone is released in China, more often than not it gets a release in India as well, seeing as these markets are very similar. One such company that is leading the way is Huawei because they are a big deal in China thanks to aggressive pricing, and so they have plans to expand to the Indian market.

They have already launched three phones to the Indian market, one of which was the Huawei Honor 3C, which to us and many of you seems to have been priced correctly. You night wonder why we would be talking about this phone seeing as though it has been on the market for a little while now, but another online retailer in India will soon stock it which is Flipkart .

The new Huawei Honor 3C price in India at Flipkart is Rs. 14999, and while it has yet to be made available from the retailer, its release is imminent due to you being able to pre-order the handset. This is a great move for the Chinese brand and follows what Motorola has done by offering a handset via India’s largest online retailer.

We presume that the Huawei Honor 3C release via Flipkart will take place next week, as it has been reported that pre-orders should start to be shipped during the last week of May, so you might want to reserve your handset now because we are certain these will sell very fast.

Recap of Huawei Honor 3C specs for those of you contemplating this handset – 5-inch LTPS display, along with 1280 x 720 pixels, MediaTek MT6582 CPU, 2GB of RAM, 8-megapixel rear-facing and 5-meagpixel front facing cameras, 8GB of storage, microSD card slot, 2300mAh battery, and Android 4.2 Jelly bean, which is a little on the old side now.
