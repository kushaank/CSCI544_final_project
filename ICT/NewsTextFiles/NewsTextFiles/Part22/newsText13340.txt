
Former Kuomintang (KMT) legislator Chiu Yi criticized Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on May 18 for printing stickers that read "I am a Taiwanese," which were then distributed to nationals currently in Vietnam.

Chiu made the remarks on his microblog page following last week's anti-China protests over a South China Sea dispute. The protests turned into riots on May 13, causing severe damage to Taiwanese-invested factories in the Southeast Asian country.

The former KMT lawmaker said that the MOFA's decision to distribute the stickers was a mistake, as it did little to protect Taiwanese nationals or Taiwan-funded firms. He said that end goal for many of the protesters during last week's riots was to rob factories for money, and it did not matter if they belonged to China or Taiwan.

Chui added that a number of factories run by Japanese, South Korean and Singaporean companies were also targeted, and Beijing and Taipei should work together with Hanoi to resolve the issue and incurred losses.

According to China's official Xinhua news agency, two Chinese nationals were killed and more than 100 others injured in the violence.
