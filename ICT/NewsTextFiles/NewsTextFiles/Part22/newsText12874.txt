
The Canadian Government has confirmed it boycotted the victory day parade held in Matara on Sunday to mark five years since the end of the war.

Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird said that as with previous years Canada did not take part in this year’s event and the reason for this had been explained to the local media by Canada’s High Commissioner to Colombo Shelley Whiting.

Canada feels holding a victory day parade is not what Sri Lanka needs and instead there needs to be more focus on the reconciliation efforts.

Only an ignorant idiot or a puppet of the LTTE would say the country should not celebrate the ending of 30 years of terrorism, destruction of property, suicide bombings, inability to send children to school in the North etc etc should not be celebrated.

No civilized nation will participate in a “celebration” of mass murders akin to genocide.
