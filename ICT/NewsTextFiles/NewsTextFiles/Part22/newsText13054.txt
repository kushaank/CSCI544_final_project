Arcadio Santiago Rodriguez, who turned 90 in December, served heroically in World War II, Korea and three tours of Vietnam. The main unit that he served in was made up of men from Puerto Rico. The outfit was nicknamed Borinqueneers.

Veterans of the Army’s 65th Infantry Regiment, an all-Puerto Rican unit that proved its courage and abilities in combat and later became known as the “Borinqueneers,” are one step closer to being awarded the Congressional Gold Medal.

The House of Representatives on Monday approved Congressman Bill Posey’s bipartisan legislation to award the medal to the unit.

Posey, R-Rockledge, introduced the legislation with Puerto Rico’s Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi. The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest civilian award that Congress can bestow, next only to the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

The bill has now moved to the U.S. Senate for its consideration.

Arcadio Santiago Rodriguez, a 90-year-old from Palm Bay, said Monday that he  was pleased the measure appears closer to passing.

Santiago Rodriguez  served 30 years in the Army, including in the Korean War. He was recommended for the Medal of Honor, but was awarded the Silver Star for galantry and initiative.
