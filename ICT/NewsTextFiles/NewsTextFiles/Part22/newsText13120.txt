
The outgoing leader of Japan's most influential business lobby Keidanren called on the country's business circles Monday to continue making efforts to improve relationships with China and South Korea, with whom Japan is involved in disputes related to territory and perceptions of history.

Hiromasa Yonekura, chairman of the Japan Business Federation, also said he hoped that participating nations in the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade talks would reach a basic agreement through political decisions by the leaders of each country.

"We cannot run away (just because the relationships have worsened,) as China and South Korea are neighboring countries," Yonekura said during his last press conference before ending his term in early June. "I hope that political relationships will turn around through the promotion of economic exchanges."

Regarding the ongoing TPP negotiations in Singapore, Yonekura voiced hope that member countries would reach a broad agreement, calling the TPP "a milestone for creating a free trade zone covering the whole Asia-Pacific region."

During his four-year term, Yonekura, who is also chairman of Sumitomo Chemical Co., said the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami was the most memorable event, saying the business lobby was able to help the disaster-hit areas immediately by setting up hotlines with the governors of each prefecture and sending necessary supplies to the region.

Toray Industries Inc. Chairman Sadayuki Sakakibara has been appointed to formally succeed Yonekura as Keidanren's next leader on June 3.
