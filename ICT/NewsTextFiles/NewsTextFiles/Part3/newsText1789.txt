
Doha: The Qatar Exchange ended in the red area when trading closed yesterday at 12,788.23 points down 232.49 points, or 1.79 percent, from the previous closing of 13,020.72 points.

The volume of shares was fell to 21,221,373 from on Sunday 22,018,619 and the value of shares increased to QR947,162,141.89 from QR787,428,226.35 on Sunday.

Among the top losers were Industries Qatar whose share down 2.95 percent to QR181, Qatar National Bank lost 2.12 percent to QR185.00, Qatar Islamic Bank fell 3.54 percent to QR92.60 and Qatar Insurance decreased by 2.60 percent to QR75.

Meanwhile, Dubai’s index made its one-day decline in eight months yesterday and technical indicators suggest it will fall further, while most other Middle East markets also retreated.

Dubai fell 5.5 percent to 4,856 points, its lowest close in a month and biggest one-day loss since August 27.

“I think we’ll see more selling — the key is that Dubai broke and then closed below 5,000 points,” said Bruce Powers, technical strategist and president at WideVision in Dubai.

There was little apparent reason for Dubai’s sudden sell-off apart from declines on global markets due to jitters about slowing growth China.

Dubai’s drop trimmed its 2014 gains to 44.1 percent as 18 stocks fell by more than five percent including market heavyweights Emaar Properties and Dubai Islamic Bank.

The measure has still more than doubled from last September, but has now declined for four straight sessions, its biggest losing streak in that surge.

“For the past two weeks there were fewer stocks participating, which was a sign of underlying weakness in the market,” said Powers.

Dubai’s slump coincided with index compiler MSCI revealing which stocks from the United Arab Emirates would be included in its emerging markets index from the end of this week.

Last June, MSCI announced its intention to upgrade the UAE and Qatar from frontier market status, which should lead to a huge influx of foreign money and also helped woo back local traders.

“At the start of year, some people were saying MSCI was already priced in, but some investors actually continued to price that in right up until (Wednesday’s) announcement,” said Sanyalaksna Manibhandu, manager of research at NBAD Securities.

Neighbouring Abu Dhabi fell 2.3 percent to 4,870 points, its biggest drop since mid-March and lowest close in nearly eight weeks.

Elsewhere Saudi Arabia made its biggest drop —0.9 percent — since April 13 and Kuwait slumped to September 2013 levels.

Egypt escaped the gloom, rising 0.6 percent in its sixth gain in seven sessions to reach a 69-month peak.
