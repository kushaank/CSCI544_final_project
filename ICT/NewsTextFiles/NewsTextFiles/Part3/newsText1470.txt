LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - A felony theft charge against Nebraska linebacker Josh Banderas has been dismissed.

Lancaster County Attorney Joe Kelly said Monday night that Banderas will enter a pre-trial diversion program rather than face charges in the theft of seven bicycles last week. Banderas is eligible for diversion because he has no prior felony convictions.

Lincoln police on May 12 arrested Banderas and Nebraska track athlete Lucas Keifer in a pickup loaded with mountain bikes. A witness spotted them using bolt cutters to remove bikes from racks near university housing.

Banderas told police he and Keifer planned to sell the bikes. Each was charged with felony theft. The charge against Banderas can be re-instated if he fails to complete his diversion program. Keifer â€™s case remains open.

Football coach Bo Pelini has not commented.
