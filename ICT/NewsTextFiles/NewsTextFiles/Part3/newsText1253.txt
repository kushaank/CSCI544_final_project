Investigators now think over heating coal may have caused the fire and explosion which sent carbon monoxide gas through the mine’s tunnels in Soma, claiming 301 lives .

While the last of the dead were buried on Sunday the whole area around the mine was closed off. There are suspicions that the true death toll is not being revealed due to the employment of illegal workers.
