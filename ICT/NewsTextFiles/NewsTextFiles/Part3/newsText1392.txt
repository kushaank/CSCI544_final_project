
County health officials stated last week that two inhabitants of Calaveras County are the initially affirmed cases of pertussis during the year 2014.

Pertussis, which is commonly called whooping cough was believed to have been totally eradicated but during the last few years it seems to have resurfaced. There have been 495 affirmed cases in California in the whole month of March.

Whooping cough directly affects the lungs and throat as it is a bacterial infection which mostly affects adolescent and very old people.
