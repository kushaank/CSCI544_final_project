
Hijab-less women have been posting selfies on the My Stealthy Freedom Facebook page, risking punishment for defying Iran's strict dress code.

Women all over Iran are letting their hair down and staging a protest by posting  pictures of themselves on Facebook without their hijabs, risking imprisonment,  among other punishments.

The page has  garnered over 300,000 likes in just over two weeks and the woman behind the page has recently launched a Twitter  micro-blog.

Even at the beach.

Since the  1979 Iranian Revolution, women have been required to cover their hair with a  hijab, and some more conservative Iranians have taken note of the social media  protest and have staged a protest of their own, according to the news website  Euronews.

Hundreds of people marched through Tehran last week to call on  the government to enforce the dress code for women. They carried posters of a  stiletto shoe with a red strike through the middle, in an apparent response to  My Stealthy Freedom, according to the report.

Hardline Islamists see the  bare-headed protest movement as evidence of creeping Westernization. One poster  read: “We will start another revolution if the Hijab situation doesn’t change.” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has been more lax than previous leaders about  the dress code, allowing looser clothing to be worn in the hot summer months,  saying the emphasis should be on virtue rather than fashion.
