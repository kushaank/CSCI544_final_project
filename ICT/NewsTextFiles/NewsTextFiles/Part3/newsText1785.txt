
THE Sentinel reconnaisance aircraft will join US planes in attempting to locate the girls who were seized over a month ago by Islamist terror group Boko Haram.

THE first British military aircraft flew to Africa yesterday to help search for more than 200 kidnapped schoolgirls missing in Nigeria.

A Sentinel reconnaissance aircraft with Lincolnshire-based 5 (Army Cooperation) Squadron left RAF Waddington for Ghana’s Accra.

It will join US aircraft in attempting to locate the girls, who were seized on April 15 from a school dormitory in the north-east of Nigeria by Islamist terror group Boko Haram.

The Sentinel flies at high altitude and uses radar to locate moving targets and monitor activity on the ground.

Last week Prime Minister David Cameron promised Britain would “do what we can” to find the girls.

It came as Foreign ­Secretary William Hague urged west African nations to come together to defeat Boko Haram during ­international talks in Paris.
