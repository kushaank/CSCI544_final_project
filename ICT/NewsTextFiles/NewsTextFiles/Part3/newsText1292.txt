
Expressing concern over the activities of armed rebels and other terrorist groups in Africa, South African President Jacob Zuma on Monday called on the African Union to do more to bring stability to the continent.“The South African government reiterates its condemnation of all forms and manner of terrorism. South Africa believes that terrorism, in any form and from whichever quarter, cannot be condoned,” he said.

In this regard, Zuma said the AU’s Standby Force needed capacity, and South Africa was looking forward to the next African Union Peace and Security Council meeting to discuss the security situation on the continent.

“It is crucial to build a stronger and a well-resourced African Union to take forward the promotion of peace, security and the socio-economic advancement of the continent,” Zuma said.

Zuma’s statement comes in the wake of recent incidents involving the abduction of over 200 school girls in Nigeria and Kenya’s recent bomb attacks that left 10 people dead last week.
