MASON CITY, Ia – Volunteers flew in from all across Iowa yesterday to paint something special at a local airport.

Several women pilots from the Iowa chapter of the National Ninety Nines organization got in their planes yesterday morning and flew to Mason City to do some volunteer work.

Every year, they like to paint one compass rose at an Iowa airport and this year, they chose Mason City.

But the painted compass isn’t just for looks, it also serves the practical purpose of ensuring that the plane’s internal compass is correct.

The Ninety Nines also promote this career to young women.

“Female pilots that come together to do various different community service tasks. We do the compass rose, we mentor young women coming up, we have scholarship programs for female pilots that are applying,” says member Lauren Sherrick of Davenport.
