
It’s like an interplanetary re-telling of the famous tortoise and hare story. Nasa and the world’s other space agencies are pursuing a careful, long-winded programme aimed at landing astronauts on Mars by 2035. Private organisations, such as the not-for-profit Mars One , are claiming that they can do the same thing by 2025.

Over-caution could mean over-spending, and with space budgets around the world continuing to be under pressure, expensive programmes mean delays and even cancellation. On the flip side, trying to do things quickly could mean cutting corners and with space being such an unforgiving environment, that would almost inevitably cost lives.

With current technology, a voyage to Mars and back would take around three years. That’s a lot of time for things to go wrong, and to encounter unexpected difficulties.

At the Royal Institution in London last week, Nasa’s chief scientist, Dr Ellen Stofan, and deputy chief technologist, Jim Adams, outlined the agency’s plans for sending humans to Mars.

The private Mars One project intends only to send humans to Mars. It does not promise to develop the technology necessary to bring them home afterwards. Undeterred, 200,000 people reportedly applied to go.

At a small press gathering after the event, I wanted to pursue the points that Stofan raised. It seemed to me that such a statement belied some underlying concerns about the safety of the private initiatives.

Adams said that although Nasa does not have a regulatory function over private companies, he thought the agency would comment if it saw something that was clearly reckless.

“I’ve heard Charlie [Bolden, the Nasa administrator] say that, if they want our expertise or advice then we’re more than happy, but not our assets,” said Stofan.
