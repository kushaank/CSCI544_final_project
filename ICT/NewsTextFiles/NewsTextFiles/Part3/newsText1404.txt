
Hungary can now send bills to the European Commission for the post-Apr 15 period, after successful talks with the Commission earlier this week on what was interpreted by critics as a potential funding freeze. The Prime Minister’s office said that after Wednesday’s talks, Hungary can expect that its invoices pertaining to the period after April 15 will be received by the EU, although it was told to hold off on them earlier.

Hungary received another 150 billion forints (EUR 491m) worth of European Union funding on Friday and another transfer is expected next week, the office said, citing deputy state secretary Nándor Csepreghy.

At the end of April, the EC had asked Hungary not to send invoices for the period after April 15 until an assessment of its EU funding system reform is completed.
