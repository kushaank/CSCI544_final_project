
Opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) yesterday criticised Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for comparing her government’s mandate with that of India’s BJP in her congratulatory message to Narendra Modi, saying the Bangladesh PM has ridiculed herself with such a claim.

The BNP spokesman was addressing a programme of Dhaka city south unit Jubo Dal, the party’s youth front, protesting the filing of ‘false cases’ against its president Rafiqul Islam Mojnu and all other leaders and activists.

Fakhrul said though they had formed elite force Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) to check militancy and terrorism, the Awami League government is killing people and making them disappeared by using the force for its political purpose.

The BNP leader termed the current regime worse than autocratic one saying the Awami League government is not only repressing the country’s people but also killing them and making them disappeared.

He urged the nationalist forces to get united to oust the current government through a strong street movement.
