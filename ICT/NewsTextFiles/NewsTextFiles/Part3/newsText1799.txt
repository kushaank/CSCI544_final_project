
Services at Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College Hospital were halted for seven hours yesterday as nurses observed work abstention after some student nurses were beaten up allegedly by interns.

The injured student nurses, Proloy Chandra Bapari and two others, are taking treatment at the hospital.

The situation alleviated after some senior doctors reached the scene and broke up the fight.

Tanmoy Bhhattacharjya, deputy director at the hospital, said a four-member committee has been formed to probe into the incident, and submit a report within seven days.

Meanwhile, over 200 students of Sylhet Nursing College boycotted examinations yesterday and demonstrated before the hospital protesting the attack.
