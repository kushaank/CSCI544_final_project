
Taipei, May 19 (CNA) A Taiwanese business association in Vietnam on Monday expressed its displeasure with the anti-China riots in the Southeast Asian country last week that affected many Taiwan businesses operating there.

Liu Mei-te, chairwoman of the Council of Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce in Vietnam, lodged a protest over the riots to the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry during a seminar attended by representatives of foreign businesses in Vietnam.

The seminar, hosted by the head of the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Vu Tien Loc, was aimed at soliciting opinions from foreign businesspeople, and a report summarizing those views will be presented to the government as a policy reference.

Taiwanese businesses have played an important part in Vietnam's development for many years, Liu said, but the riots have destroyed established enterprises, making it less likely Taiwanese businesspeople will invest more in the country.

Liu expressed hope that the Vietnamese government will keep its promise to help Taiwanese and other foreign businesses that suffered losses during the riots resume operations.

How the Vietnamese compensate the affected foreign businesses will influence the willingness of foreign investors to put money into Vietnam in the future, Liu said.

A business representative from South Korea echoed Liu's remarks and hoped that similar riots would not happen again.

Anti-Chinese protests erupted in southern Vietnam on May 13 over a Chinese oil-drilling venture in an area of the South China Sea that Hanoi insists is in its exclusive economic zone.
