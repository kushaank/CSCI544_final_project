
Hishammuddin on MH370: 'What's the point of scrambling jets?'

(May 20): Malaysia continued to defend its military's inaction over an unknown aircraft, later identified as Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, after it went off course and vanished on 8 March as it wasn't considered a hostile object.

Defense and Acting Transport Minister Datuk Seri Hishamuddin Hussein told Australian Broadcasting Corp's "Four Corners" programme yesterday that no action was taken because the plane was deemed commercial and therefore not hostile. The plane which was to fly to Beijing, had turned back over Vietnam's waters and flown in a westerly direction over Peninsular Malaysia.

Military radar detected it over the Strait of Malacca but did not scramble jets to investigate, a point for which Malaysia continues to be criticized.

"If you're not going to shoot it down, what's the point of sending it (a fighter) up?" the Associated Press quoted Hishamuddin saying on the "Four Corners" broadcast.

The minister also added that had the Boeing 777 been shot down, "I'd be in a worse position, probably."

The Beijing-bound plane carried 239 crew and passengers, mostly Chinese nationals.

When releasing a preliminary report on the plane's disappearance earlier this month, Hishamuddin said he was informed of the military's radar detection two hours after it went missing and had relayed the information to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, who then ordered a search in the Strait of Malacca.

In the early days of the search, however, the military initially denied the air turn back and the bulk of search efforts was focused in the South China Sea. The delays in confirming the plane's change of direction has drawn public condemnation, especially from the families of the passengers over the wasted search for wreckage.
