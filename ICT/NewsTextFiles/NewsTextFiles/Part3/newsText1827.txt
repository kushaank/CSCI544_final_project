
Kenya: Against the backdrop of travel advisories slapped on Kenya by a number of Western countries, the Government is now courting new markets.

Yesterday, Tourism Cabinet Secretary Phyllis Kandie held talks with the Vice Chairman of the China National Tourism Administration Wang Zhifa.

Kandie said the visit by Zhifa and his delegation was a follow up from the Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang’s recent visit.

The CS said among the things discussed was a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the Kenyan and Chinese governments on creating and maintaining a tourism bond.

“The Chinese government is interested in Kenyan tourism and we will concentrate on tourism promotion and development,” said Kandie.

She said she would be travelling to China later this month for talks with her Chinese counterpart as a step in implementing the 2004 MoU.

Zhifa said China was committed to having more tourists from his country visiting Kenya.

“The Chinese tourists who have been to Kenya like the tourism products Kenya has to offer,” he said.
