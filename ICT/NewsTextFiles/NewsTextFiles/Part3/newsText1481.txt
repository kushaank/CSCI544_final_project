
STRIKE-hit platinum producer Lonmin has appealed to the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) to return to wage talks, warning on Tuesday that despite a preference for a negotiated outcome it was increasingly looking at "other options" to bring an end to 16 weeks of strike action in the sector.

The world’s third-largest platinum producer said on Tuesday that the company had lost more than a third of its production for the year, while striking employees had lost 32% of their annual wage.

Lonmin CEO Ben Magara told journalists at a briefing in Johannesburg on Monday the company still believed a negotiated resolution to the strike would represent the best outcome, but was becoming "sufficiently desperate" and could consider turning to the courts to rule the strike "dysfunctional".

Lonmin was beginning to question "whether this strike is benefiting anybody", said Mr Magara.

"Lonmin and Amcu leaders should jointly examine the will of employees, to bring an end to the strike and agree to discuss long-term solutions to problems facing the sector.

"Because what they are telling us in their thousands is very different to what Amcu appears to be hearing from its members," said Mr Magara.

Amcu members downed tools in January at Lonmin, Impala Platinum and Anglo American Platinum precipitating a four-month-long strike that shows no signs of drawing to a conclusion after talks broke down earlier this month.

The length of the strike prompted Lonmin to appeal to its workers to return to work last week, prompting fears of violence and intimidation on the platinum belt.

Lonmin has declined to provide details of the number of employees who have chosen to return to work since last week.

Speaking on the sidelines of a New Age business briefing on Tuesday, Amcu president Joseph Mathunjwa said members had clearly rejected the appeal from Lonmin to return to work, saying no further meetings were planned between the union and producers.

Mr Mathunjwa denied that Amcu was a violent union or that its members were involved in intimidating nonstriking workers.

Amcu intends to challenge the right of producers to sideline the union and communicate with striking workers in the Labour Court in Johannesburg on Tuesday.

Mr Mathunjwa said the union was convinced producers had violated the 98th convention of the International Labour Organisation — which addresses rights to association and collective bargaining.

Mr Magara said on Monday "Amcu is indeed our majority union and we respect that".

Lonmin would however strongly oppose the interdict, and did not believe that communication had violated the labour relations act.

"But outside the mechanics of the law we cannot understand Amcu’s objection".

Amcu members were employees first and union members second, said Mr Magara. "Without being our employees they would not be members of Amcu," he said.

Lonmin on Monday also dismissed 235 essential services workers.

"These are employees who have been absent since January 23, so the recent intimidation does not explain their absence," spokesman Happy Nkhoma said.

"A court order to this effect was obtained on February 27 requiring all essential workers to return to work by May 12."
