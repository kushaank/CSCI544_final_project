
The ICC’s former chief prosecutor says the Palestinians wouldn’t have much of a case against Israel.

In the dysfunctional state of Israeli-Palestinian relations, the “nuclear option” for the Palestinians would be joining the International Criminal Court as a member state and exercising that membership to launch war crimes investigations against Israel. At least, that’s the view of many in Israel, which, like the United States, is not a member of the ICC.

But he isn’t at all sure that if the Palestinian Authority were to join the ICC — or if Israel were to join, for that matter — the international court would actually play an active role in the conflict.

The Palestinian Authority did go to the United Nations, and its status has since been upgraded to non-member observer state, making it eligible to join the court. All the same, Moreno-Ocampo said ICC membership could be a double-edged sword for the Palestinians, since it would also open them up to investigation for alleged war crimes, such as rocket fire and bombings targeting Israeli civilians.

Moreno-Ocampo’s warnings may seem strange to those who see the ICC as an interventionist organization of busybodies, but he doesn’t see the international court as an institution that should necessarily be conducting many global investigations.

Twelve years after the international court was founded, it is hard to find many supporters. In addition to Israel, the United States, Russia, China and India have not signed or ratified the treaty that established the ICC. The small number of indictments that have led to trials have all been focused on Africa, leading to accusations of bias. There are also indications that the court has not been particularly effective.

Sudanese President Omar Bashir, who in 2008 became the first sitting head of state to be indicted of war crimes and genocide, has become the ICC’s most high-profile case, but he seems no closer to trial five years after the court issued a warrant for his arrest. Likewise, the ICC’s attempts to participate in the prosecution of senior members of the former Libyan regime have been rebuffed by the new rulers in Tripoli, and the court has not taken any substantive steps toward involvement in prosecuting Syrian President Bashar Assad, though he is directing the murder of tens of thousands of civilians in Syria’s civil war.

Moreno-Ocampo has no doubt that “Bashar will face a court” one day. “Who thought that one day Gadhafi would be brought down, or that his son or [Muammar Gadhafi’s intelligence chief Abdullah] Senoussi would be put on trial.” When I remind him that Gadhafi was brutally lynched and that the ICC has been kept out of the Libyan trials, he replies that the international court served its role by launching an investigation and issuing a warrant for Senoussi’s arrest.

The former chief prosecutor is certain the ICC’s impact will be felt over decades, not necessarily because of the cases that actually go through the court but because it is drawing a line between war crimes that can only be prosecuted by an international forum and cases that will be increasingly dealt with by the countries where the war crimes took place.

The ICC must investigate the multiple war crimes and human rights violations committed by the terrorist organizations the PLO-Hamas. They are too many to count.

Transferring a population (the settlers) to occupied land is a war crime. Cast Lead is a major war crime. And, speaking of the murder of civilians-- Israel has killed more civilians by a factor of 12 to 1. Nuremberg Redux.

With reasoning of Mr. Moreno-Ocampo regarding acts of terror and war crimes, it is natural that there will be zero cases for ICC. Nürnberg trial will not be necessary, because, even Nazi murderers, will not be guilty of anything.

He says: “But here, even if the situation is awful, you cannot disappear; you have the rule of law.” The law in the occupied territories is what the IDF, the occupier, says they are. I guess any authority, whether representative or not, is lawful, huh? That this guy was head of the ICC boggles the mind.

Everything thing Moreno-Ocampo said is absolutely correct. He is one of the precious few who engage in international law with genuine expertise and impartiality. His court, the ICC carries tremendous respect internationally.   Whether his successor is as good as Moreno-Ocampo was remains to be seen but there is no reason to suppose she is not.   The real danger is that the unprecedented political pressure resulting from an Israel-Palestine case (the whole undeveloped world will be crying out for a guilty verdict no matter what the law of facts) could be put on the new successor such that the whole court system breaks down. There is a real risk the ICC may not survive it.

they think everything is justified in the name of "resistance", but only they think so, the world has a higher standard and the pals will be prosecuted for crimes against humanity. Israel has documentation on every military move showing why they took specific actions.  pals going to court is like an attempted murderer who gets caught and injured and is now trying to sue the homeowner for defending himself.

If the court calls the Israeli regime's system sufficient to make it impossible for anyone else to prosecute the crimes it whitewashes and ignores, then it confirms the opinion that it is nothing more than a tool of 'great powers' to demonize and attack those who dare to oppose them.  If, on the other hand, the court lives up to what it is claimed to be, and issues indictments against the leadership of the Israeli regime and its armed branch, the US will launch a full scale assault on the court.  Either way, it will be a crisis for the court Ocampo loves to promote, with years of battling for legitimacy ahead of it.

The problem the ICC has is people like you. On the one hand, HATE Israel dream of hurting her in some way and hope and pray organisations that can hurt Israel use that power to hurt Israel.  On the other hand, Israel is completely innocent of all wrongdoing under the law.   Hence, the ICC has to chose between correct law or massive political pressure by people like you threating to damage the credibility of the Court with respect to genuine wrongdoers if you  not get your way with the ICC. If the ICC does not follow the haters, the haters will politically try to attack it and undermine its genuine work stopping real wrongdoers. But if the ICC gives in to purely political pressure, it will lose the confidence of the international community as being an impartial court and it will meet the same fate as the ICJ, disused, distrusted and largely ignored. Genuine war crimes like using rape as a weapon of war will then go unpunished for decades.   All thanks to your obsessive hate of Israel.

It may be a small step in the right direction. From the ICC we would get clarity on the legality of the settlements. Other advantages would be... better treatment of Palestinian children, prisoners, protesters. The Israelis would hate a light shining in on their murky activities.

The former Prosecutor's statements make perfect sense to anyone who appreciates that courts don't want to be seen as a tool or weapon of one side in a conflict, especially if they want their decisions to be respected and enforced.  In the US, courts are often reluctant to intervene in political disputes or in situations where they feel or both sides have not exhausted alternative means of resolution or recourse. His point that a number of  Palestinians could also face prosecution at the ICC is valid as well.

Israel is an Apartheid state. Anybody that sanctioned the use of Phosphorus on civilians should and must be held accountable. The shooting of unarmed men,women and children should and must be held accountable. The killing of unarmed UN personnel should and must be held accountable. Military personnel cannot and should use the old excuse they only obeying orders.

Actually Tommy nobody sanctioned the use of phosphorous against civilians. The use of phosphor flares to light up,a battlefield is legitimate under the rules of war. It is fired into the air and floats down under a small parachute. When it eventually lands it is burnt out and cold. It cannot be aimed and fired at anybody. Should the killing of men, women and children by suicide and car bombs also be held accountable. What about the firing of thousands of rockets into civilian areas and lets not forget the slaughter of babies in their sleep.

Which is why the leaders of the Palestinian Authority must be brought to justice for these and other atrocities against innocent civilians. This includes sending suicide bombers into buses, restaurants and malls those responsible for the firing of thousands of rockets and mortars into civilian area. The old excuse of "Resistance" should not and cannot be used as an excuse for these human rights violations.

I don't get this Haaretz journalist making a case in favour of Israel not joining the ICC. It's a disgrace! Israel has nothing to hide, palestinians don't have anything against Israel and they have their rockets targeting civilians. Why should Israel follow the lead of such a terrible example as the manager of Guantamo Prison? Regarding moral issues we're well above the US and we shall demonstrate it.

And while Israel ultimately won that war, it was never the same in terms of assurance of it's military dominance. The same can be said of legal aspects of Israeli policy in occupied territory. Things might not go so well as predicted at the ICC. And if things go badly, there is no recourse and no alternative.

That, indeed, Israeli colonization of the West Bank is a war crime. A war crime where the perpetrators (Bibi and his gang) are indeed being shielded from the consequences of their acts by their own courts.  I would suggest that this fits the very definition that Moreno-Ocampo describes as a crime that is prosecutable by the ICC.

It is the importnance of when the clock starts counting, from 2002 or now. Any settlement building  that happened before 2002 would be off limits for the prosecution that settlements violated int'l law prior to that because Palestinine was never a coutry then and the territory was disputed. I ti still diputed today and I think you will find it impossible to prove much of the settlement exapnsion following 2002. The ICC will never adjudicated the land dispute.

Who paid for his visit to Israel, I wonder?  A lot of hedging by him throughout his statement. Interesting he says good things about the Israeli legal system, when everything I read indicates apartheid practices abound. This alone makes me question his view of the ICC's possible actions. In any case, it will be interesting to see Israel try to defend itself, if indeed it has the guts to actually show up in the Court. My prediction is that Israel will call the Court clearly anti-Semitic and will refuse to cooperate.

Sadly you know nothing about war or war crimes, only how to support a football team.  No Israeli war crimes have been committed that have not been fully and justly dealt with under the Israeli Courts.  The fact that you disagree only proves you know nothing at all about IHL and have no idea how to find genuine, impartial and reliable opinions on the topic.
