
UNDATED (WSAU-Wheeler News) Â Wisconsin lawmakers are being asked again for emergency funding to fix the larger number of potholes created during the rough winter. The Urban Alliance and its president, Racine Mayor John Dickert, said many communities are struggling to keep up with needed repairs -- and his own crews are "absolutely slammed right now."

The Urban Alliance is a coalition of Wisconsin mayors. Dickert said the group's members estimate it will cost an extra $12-million to fix roads, water mains, and other infra-structure damaged by the extreme cold and deep frost. Earlier this month, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett made a similar request for state aid on behalf of his city -- but the Legislature's Joint Finance Committee never took it up a couple days later. Dickert says cities have no choice but to make the repairs -- and if the state doesn't help, the money would have to come from somewhere else.

Last week Governor Scott Walker said local communities were already given more state funds that should be used for fixing potholes. He said a four-percent funding increase for local road repairs was approved in the current state budget that was adopted a year ago. He told Wisconsin Public Radio it was a "pretty substantial increase" from previous years.
