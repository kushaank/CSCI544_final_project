
After a stepped-up campaign to save Kever Dovid HaMelech along with increased tefilos around the world, MK Miri Regev announced the second floor of the tziyun is not going to be given to the Vatican. Regev, who chairs the Knesset Internal Affairs Committee, announced that Public Security Minister Yitzchak Aharonovich told her there would not be any change in any portion of the tziyun complex during next week’s papal visit.

There has been a measurably increased campaign to stop the giveaway amid reports in the Italian and other European media that Israel secretly agreed to give the Last Supper room above the tziyun to the Vatican during the pope’s upcoming visit. Senior government officials including Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman denied any such deal exists but this did not dissuade the tzibur from holding events to pressure the government to cancel the deal. His deputy, Ze’ev Elkin echoed his words, stated emphatically there is no deal to give away any portion of the tziyun.

Aharonovich was apparently quoting messages he received from the Prime Minister’s Office which said “there will be no change in the status quo at the tziyun”.

The pope will be in Israel on Sunday 25 Iyar and Monday, 26 Iyar 5774.
