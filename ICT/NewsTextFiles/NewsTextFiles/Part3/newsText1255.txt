
COPPERBELT University (CBU) registrar Allan Ilunga has advised mining companies to take into account environmental concerns like land degradation and its negative impact on sustainable food production.

Mr Ilunga made the remarks in Kitwe last week when Deputy Minister of Transport, Works, Supply and Communications Panji Kaunda visited CBU on a sensitisation programme on Government’s affirmative action on youth employment.

Mr Ilunga said mines should not be allowed to dig pits everywhere because this has environmental implications for future generations.

“Agriculture is contributing much more than mining to our coffers, so we must pay more attention to it,” Mr Ilunga said.

And Colonel Kaunda urged universities to feel free to advise government on various issues because they are more privileged with knowledge and information from research activities.

He observed that in other countries, universities are big consultants for Governments and they are trusted to provide solutions to the many challenges that communities face.

“So even here, we need to change our mindsets as Government vis-à-vis universities. Here we treat universities as if they are just another secondary school,” Col Kaunda said.

And Professor Clive Chirwa, who is a lecturer in the school of engineering, urged Government to give universities a chance to come up with standards in the construction sector.

He said this is why some contractors apply their own standards from their countries of origin when they are awarded contracts in Zambia.

Prof Chirwa described this situation as chaotic.
