
NEW YORK — American telecommunications corporation AT&T plans to buy DirecTV for $48.5bn, gaining more than 38-million video subscribers at home and in Latin America and stepping up an acquisition-fuelled overhaul of the $110bn US pay-TV industry.

AT&T will pay $95 for each share of DirecTV, split between $28.50 in cash and the equivalent of $66.50 in stock, the companies said on Sunday in a statement.

That is a 10% premium to DirecTV’s closing price last Friday. Including net debt, the deal values the largest US satellite-TV company at $67.1bn.

AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson is embarking on the firm’s largest takeover in eight years to bulk up after competitors Comcast and Time Warner Cable announced their own merger, accelerating consolidation across the communications industry.

The purchase gives AT&T a national satellite-TV provider to combine with its existing packages of wireless, phone and high-speed internet service.

"Strategically, this makes a lot of sense for AT&T," Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson said in Provo, Utah. Gaining a satellite-TV provider "lets them go national with a video offering that matches their wireless reach."

DirecTV jumped 9.3% to the equivalent of $94.22 in Frankfurt on Monday morning after closing at $86.18 in New York on Friday. AT&T fell less than 0.1% to the equivalent of $36.73 after closing at $36.74 in the US.

The agreement was approved by both boards, and the firms expect the deal to close within 12 months, pending regulatory review and approval from DirecTV’s shareholders.

To help with regulatory approval in Latin America, AT&T said it plans to divest its 8% stake in America Movil.

With the transaction, AT&T said its high-speed broadband network will cover 70-million customer locations. That was one of the reasons for the deal because it helps customers watch TV on any device, DirecTV CEO Mike White said in a phone interview.

"Randall and I have had a relationship for a number of years. Over the last year, things began to change with technologies — AT&T started to be able to offer more broadband and better broadband. With it comes a continuing evolution for mobile video," he said.

In the joint phone interview, Mr Stephenson highlighted DirecTV’s relationships with content providers and head start in setting up a package of internet-delivered channels similar to a pay-TV bundle, known as over-the-top service.

DirecTV will still be based in El Segundo, California, and its service will be available on a standalone basis for at least three years after the acquisition closes.

The companies said the deal will add to free cash flow and earnings per share within 12 months of closing, and cost savings will top $1.6bn on an annual basis.

AT&T plans to finance the cash portion of the deal with cash on hand, the sale of noncore assets, committed financing facilities and opportunistic debt market transactions. AT&T had a market value of about $191bn as of Friday and had total debt of about $80bn and cash and equivalents of $3.6bn at the end of March.

Including debt, the acquisition is AT&T’s third-largest deal on record, behind the purchase of BellSouth for $83bn in 2006 and the deal for Ameritech, which closed in 1999, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The deal is also the third-largest for the communications industry in the past year, ranking after Verizon Communication’s $130bn deal for the rest of its US wireless venture and the pending $68bn purchase of Time Warner Cable, the data show.

At the $67.1bn deal value, which includes debt, AT&T is paying 8.15 times DirecTV’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) in the 12 months through March, according to Bloomberg data. That is in line with a median multiple of 8.11 times trailing 12-month ebitda for cable and satellite companies over $1bn in the past five years, the data show.

Comcast offered about 8.6 times ebitda for Time Warner Cable, the data show.

Comcast’s plan to acquire Time Warner Cable will create an even bigger provider of both TV and internet in the US. In March, Mr Stephenson called the Time Warner Cable takeover an "industry-redefining deal."

One of the main questions about the potential deals is whether regulators will allow them. Comcast’s takeover of Time Warner Cable has not been approved yet. A merger of DirecTV and satellite-TV rival Dish Network was blocked more than a decade ago.

AT&T had to abandon a purchase of Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile US unit in 2011 in the face of antitrust opposition.

Unlike Comcast’s acquisition of Time Warner Cable, AT&T’s purchase of DirecTV would eliminate a choice for pay-TV customers in some markets because AT&T’s U-verse landline video service competes with DirecTV. AT& T’s U-verse TV service had about 5.7-million customers at the end of the first quarter while DirecTV has 20.3-million customers in the US.

Mr White and Mr Stephenson confirmed AT&T will offer both U-verse and DirecTV in markets where the products overlap.

If this becomes a regulatory issue, AT&T could theoretically stop offering U-verse TV and only offer DirecTV along with U-verse broadband, but no decisions have been made because the companies did not feel the need to offer this condition yet, according to a person familiar with the matter.

To facilitate antitrust approval in Latin America, AT&T will sell all of its L and AA shares in Carlos Slim’s America Movil, and its designees to America Movil’s board will tender their resignations. An America Movil official declined to comment.

Mr Stephenson said he met with Mr Slim to discuss his plan to do the deal and reaffirmed they had a strong relationship.

America Movil is a direct competitor to DirecTV in countries including Brazil and Colombia. DirecTV’s Latin America operation includes Mexico, where it has a minority stake in Sky Mexico, controlled by Grupo Televisa.

Selling the stake in America Movil will reduce AT&T’s earnings by about 5c a share, according to the statement.

AT&T now projects 2014 per-share earnings growth at the low end of its earlier forecast for a "mid-single digit" increase.

Mr Stephenson said that he is offering "unprecedented concessions" to help ease the regulatory review process.

"There are sensitive areas for sure but they are all manageable," he said in the interview. "We think this will pass regulatory muster."

AT&T will not owe a breakup fee to DirecTV if the deal is blocked by regulators on antitrust grounds, the CEOs said. In AT&T’s failed effort to acquire T-Mobile, the firm paid out $3bn in cash plus wireless frequencies and a roaming agreement.

DirecTV will pay AT&T a breakup fee of 3% of the $48.5bn value, or about $1.46bn, if it instead agrees to be sold to another company, according to two people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified. AT&T said it would commit to abiding by the principles of net neutrality for three years, meaning it would not block websites or selectively speed up or slow down internet traffic.

Consumer groups have started speaking out against the merger. "The captains of our communications industry have clearly run out of ideas," advocacy group Free Press CEO Craig Aaron said. "Instead of innovating and investing in their networks, companies like AT&T and Comcast are simply buying up the competition. These takeovers are expensive, and consumers end up footing the bill for merger mania."

One of the biggest beneficiaries of DirecTV’s rally this year is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, thanks to a stake built by his deputy stock pickers at about half last week’s price. Berkshire had about 34.5-million shares as of March 31, a regulatory filing showed last week.
