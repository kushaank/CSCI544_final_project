
Local people in Chittagong city rescued a businessman from an abduction attempt hearing him shout for help when some men identifying themselves as army officers were trying to force him into a microbus on Sunday night.

One of the alleged abductors, Arif Ahammed, 44, a former army major, was caught with his car and handed over to police but the rest fled in the microbus.

The victim, Golam Rabbani, owner of a chemical supplying company, filed a case against two men including Arif and four to five unidentified people with Double Mooring Police Station yesterday. The details of the other man, Faisal Nawsal, 40, could not be found, claimed police.

Arif and Faisal intercepted Rabbani around 8:00pm and asked him to go with them, saying there was an arrest order against him, said the case statement. When Rabbani refused, they tried to drag him to a microbus standing nearby with four to five men inside it, but he started shouting, bringing his brother Golam Masud and locals who were nearby, it said.

Arif currently works as manager of human resources and administration at GH Haewae Co. Ltd, a garment factory in Chittagong EPZ. His colleague Kamal Uddin told The Daily Star that Arif was sent into retirement for suffering from some sort of a mental disorder.

Arif lives in Montague DOHS in Bayezid area of Chittagong city. Police sent him to Chittagong Medical College Hospital and said they would take him to court later.

The victim said police initially refused to register the case. "And instead of taking the abductor to court, they sent him to hospital," he told The Daily Star.
