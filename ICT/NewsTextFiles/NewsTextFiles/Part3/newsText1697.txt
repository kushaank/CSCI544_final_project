
Elio Motors, a manufacturer of three wheeled vehicles, have won a battle in Colorado and Illinois over an archaic helmet law.

Under previous legislation anyone under the age 19 was required to wear a helmet if operating a three wheeled vehicle, but this did not take in to account modern designs like the Elio, which are closer to cars than motorcycles in terms of function and safety.

Both the Colorado and Illinois House of Representatives passed bills last week to exempt this requirement. The bills also removed the requirement for drivers of “autocycles” to hold a motorcycle licence.

A cursory glance at the Elio show it to be, by all intents and purposes – a car, with a similar length, a full body and chassis, a steering wheel, brake pedals, and so forth. Though it may not be marketed as car, it certainly isn’t a bike.

In fact with a 5-star crash test safety rating, it’s a lot safer than motorbikes and many traditional four wheeled vehicles. It will also sell at an extremely competitive price when it hits the market in 2015, for just $6,800.

Though there are still a few legislative setbacks, Elio Motors CEO Paul Elio believes that these will all be sorted by time his flagship vehicle hits the assembly line in Shreveport, Louisiana.

The changes in legislation do not affect other three wheeled vehicles. Motorcycle owners are still required to have a valid license and wear a helmet when applicable.
