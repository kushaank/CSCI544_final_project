KONAWA — A man and woman have been arrested on suspicion of enabling child abuse after a video was posted on a social media site showing a teenager taking a running start and repeatedly kicking an 8-year-old boy in the head.

A local newspaper reports that the 33-year-old woman and 28-year-old man were arrested last week after the video was posted to Instagram.

Police say the teen is the woman’s son and the younger child is the man’s son. Police suspect the man shot the video while the woman looked on.

A Seminole County judge set the man’s bond at $250,000 and the woman’s at $75,000.

The teen was also arrested on suspicion of aggravated assault and is being held without bond at a juvenile detention facility.
