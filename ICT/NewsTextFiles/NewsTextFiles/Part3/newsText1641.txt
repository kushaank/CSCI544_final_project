Maine Sen. Angus King, who ran as an independent but caucuses with Senate Democrats, announced last week that he would endorse not only New Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen–a move many might expect because, despite his efforts to avoid being pinned down, he almost always votes with the Democrats–but Maine Republican Susan Collins as well.

These bipartisan endorsements were the political play of the week, month and maybe the year.

To be clear, the idea that Sen. King endorsed a Republican is not a game-changer; in fact, Sen. Collins is probably a shoo-in to win. But the political dexterity that went with this is impressive.  He gets to add to his bipartisan credentials back home while suffering zero political blowback within the ranks of the Democratic caucus.  The staffer who came up with this idea deserves a raise.
