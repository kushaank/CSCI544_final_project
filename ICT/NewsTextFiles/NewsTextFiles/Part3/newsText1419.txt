
SINGAPORE — Brent crude rose to $110 a barrel on Monday on renewed concern about Libya’s oil output and following some of the worst violence in Tripoli since the 2011 war against Muammar Gaddafi.

Heavily armed gunmen stormed Libya’s parliament on Sunday and demanded its suspension, claiming loyalty to a renegade army general and deepening the chaos in the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) oil producer.

"This is the worst outbreak of militia-related violence for a while and a reversal of the relatively positive sentiment that we had from Libya earlier in the month," Société Générale’s head of commodities research in Asia, Mark Keenan, said.

"It’s very likely that Libya is going to retain a strong geopolitical risk premium in oil markets going forward," Mr Keenan said.

Brent July crude gained 23c to $109.98 a barrel by 3.58am GMT, after earlier touching an intraday high of $110.03.

Front-month Brent ended last week nearly 2% higher.

US crude rose 17c a barrel to $102.19, after settling 52c a barrel higher on Friday. The June West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude contract expires on Tuesday.

In April, an end to a month-long blockade of key oil ports in eastern Libya, raised the prospect of more Libyan crude exports and weighed on global oil prices. But last week, just-opened oilfields were closed again and clashes erupted in the east, with 43 people killed and more than 100 wounded in Benghazi.

The country’s output fell to about 200,000 barrels a day from 300,000 barrels a day earlier last week, and it remains far below the 1.4-million barrels a day produced last year.

The conflict in Ukraine provided further support as US President Barack Obama spoke with French President François Hollande about the situation on Friday, the two agreeing that Russia faced "significant" further costs if it continued provocative and destabilising behaviour.

Meanwhile, Russia was ready to discuss a gas price discount for Ukraine if Kiev paid off the more than $2.2bn it owed as of April 1, Energy Minister Alexander Novak said.

Russia has warned that it will not supply Ukraine with gas in June unless Kiev pays in advance by June 2, raising fear that deliveries to Europe could be affected.

A shortage of natural gas in Europe could prop up demand for substitute fuels such as oil.

Iran and six world powers made little progress last week in talks on ending their dispute over Tehran’s nuclear programme, US and Iranian officials said. Their comments raised doubts over the prospects for a breakthrough by July 20, which marks the end of a temporary agreement that eases some sanctions against the key oil producer.

Oil prices also found support from data showing US housing starts jumped in April and building permits hit their highest level in nearly six years, indicating the world’s top economy is gaining traction.
