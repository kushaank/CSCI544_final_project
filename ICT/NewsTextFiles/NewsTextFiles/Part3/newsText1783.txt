
A blaze that gutted five shops in the Johannesburg city centre at dawn yesterday has caused great distress to the victims.

Store owner Lucy Mofokeng said she had lost everything, while pre-school owner Ragie Iol said the school had to be temporarily closed due to safety factors.

The destroyed centre, Roma Court, which is home to the Eagle Pre-school, situated at the upper building of the store, is unable to operate, even though the damages was not severe. However, as a result of the incident, the children have been asked to return home for safety considerations.

Pre-school owner Iol said when he arrived in the morning at 8am, he found that the classes were engulfed in a cloud of smoke.

“The children had to be sent home since the parents did not want to keep their children at a school that had been destroyed by fire,” he said.

Mulaudzi said the incident, which he described as “extensive”, was reported to the emergency service at 6am, and occurred to a building located between Bree and Mooi streets.

Frustrated grocery store owner Mofokeng said she had received a call about 4am with the information that her store had caught fire.

“I don’t know what could have caused the fire. The restaurant next to us uses a gas stove. I think they might have left it on, but I am not accusing anyone,” she said.

“For now I don’t know what to do as this shop is my life. I have lost everything. I have been running this shop for four years,” Mofokeng said.

Johannesburg metro police spokesperson superintendent Wayne Minnaar said by 8am the roads had been reopened to traffic.
