
MANILA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 94 leftist rebels and their supporters surrendered to the Philippine military since last week, a military official said Monday.

Maj. Gen. Ricardo Visaya, commander of the Philippine Army's 4th Infantry Division, said most of the members of the leftist rebel group New People's Army (NPA) who surrendered came from the southern Philippine province of Agusan del Sur.

Visaya also said the surrenderees included 14 minors. The leftist rebels brought with them 90 assorted firearms.

He said the surrender of 94 leftist rebels and their supporters further weakened the strength of the NPA in the southern Philippines. Recent estimates put the number of NPA guerrillas in northern Mindanao at 800 to 900.

The 4,000-strong NPA, armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines, is fighting a 45-year leftist insurgency in 60 provinces.
