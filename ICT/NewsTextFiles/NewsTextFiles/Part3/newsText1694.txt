
Wolfeboro, NH, Police Commissioner Robert Copeland, who sparked outrage after using a racial slur to describe President Barack Obama, has verbally resigned, according to multiple reports.

Copeland said last week he wouldn’t apologize for calling President Barack Obama the N-word during a conversation at a restaurant in March.

WBZ Radio’s Carl Stevens tweeted Wolfeboro Town Manager David Owen’s reaction after learning about the resignation.

news reports of Copeland’s comments, many people called the town and threatened to cancel their vacations in New Hampshire. State officials told the AP they were flooded with calls, emails, and tweets reacting to the comments and calling for his resignation.

“Commissioner Copeland’s reprehensible comments dishonor law enforcement officials across our state who work hard to ensure that all citizens are treated fairly, and the remarks do not represent the values of New Hampshire residents,” Hinkle said in a written statement to Boston.com.

On Sunday, former Bay State Gov. Mitt Romney echoed others by calling for an apology and resignation. Romney owns a home in the Lake Winnipesaukee resort town.

“The vile epithet used and confirmed by the commissioner has no place in our community,” Romney said in a written statement.
