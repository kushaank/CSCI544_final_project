Recent tension over Ukraine has called into question the future of U.S.-Russian cooperation in space. Last week, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin said that Russia wouldn’t cooperate with the U.S. on the International Space Station beyond 2020. Russia also announced it would ban the export of rocket engines, which are used by the U.S. space program.

Since the end of the Space Shuttle program, Russia has become an essential part of the U.S. space program. NASA has relied on Russia to transport astronauts to the ISS at a cost of $71 million each. However, assuming that Russia has not changed its mind by 2020 NASA should be able to get along without them. According to The Washington Post , NASA Administrator Charles Bolden told a press conference that the agency expects their commercial partners to be ready to transport astronauts by 2017.

To emphasize that point, NASA released a statement on Monday showcasing the progress and accomplishments of the agency’s private sector partners. Those partners include Blue Origin, The Boeing Company, Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) and Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX). All four companies are developing new spacecraft and rocket engines which could carry astronauts to the ISS or beyond in the near future.
