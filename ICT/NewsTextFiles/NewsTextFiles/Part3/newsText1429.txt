Read your history and see that Corrie was working for the Pals at the height of intifada-2 in 2003, when the Pals were not just blowing up buses and restaurants and slaughtering Israeli civilians - they were proud of the fact they did so.

If these parents had brought her up right, she would not be dead now. Now, they are trying to make up for thier lack of parenting by dragging this thing out for years and years.  Give it up, she is dead and it is your fault.
