
Taoiseach Enda Kenny has come face-to-face and shaken hands with Garda whistleblower Maurice McCabe for the first time.

The  sergeant, who exposed the wiping of penalty points and other allegations of Garda malpractice, was on duty in Mullingar yesterday evening when the Taoiseach approached him during a walkabout in the town.

The pair shook hands and engaged in conversation for a short period but did not discuss any of the recent events surrounding the fallout from the Guerin Report and the resignation of former justice minister, Alan Shatter.

A government spokesperson described the meeting as “brief and courteous”.

Last week, the Taoiseach said  he had “no problem apologising” to the whistleblower for the way the Government handled his warnings of Garda malpractice.

Mr Kenny said Sgt McCabe had been “vindicated” by the Guerin probe into his concerns.

“I’ve already spoken of the importance and the right of people to bring issues to public notice that should be brought to public notice. So, in that regard, I have no problem in apologising to Sgt McCabe for the issues that he raised and for the fact that his raising these matters wasn’t dealt with more speedily,” he said.

The Guerin Report published earlier this month severely criticised  Mr Shatter, members of An Garda Síochána, and its watchdog GSOC for failing to properly investigate allegations of rogue  policing.

The eight-week review of the claims found that no official body was prepared to accept the word of Sgt  McCabe who risked his career to expose the catalogue of failures.

Mr Shatter resigned after reading a portion of the report in advance of it being published.
