
US troops will take part in a multinational military exercise in Jordan next week in a bid to demonstrate the US commitment to security and stability in the region, the Pentagon said Monday.

About 6,000 US troops, along with those from more than 20 other nations, will hold the Eager Lion 14 exercise which will run from May 25 to June 8, Xinhua quoted Pentagon spokesperson Steve Warren as telling reporters.

An estimated of 3,000 Jordanian soldiers and some 3,200 troops from over 20 partner-nations will also take part in the drill, Jordan's fourth annual large-scale multilateral military exercises.

This exercise, including flight operations and naval drills, will be carried out at military installations across Jordan and in international waters in the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea.

During the exercise, security challenges will be designed to strengthen relationships through a comprehensive, multinational approach, Pentagon officials were quoted by the American Forces Press Service as saying.
