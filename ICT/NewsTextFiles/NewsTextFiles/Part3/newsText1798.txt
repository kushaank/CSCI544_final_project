
Salma Akhter, wife of disappeared Benapole municipality panel mayor Tariqul Alam Tuhin, at a press conference yesterday alleged that Rapid Action Battalion (Rab) abducted her husband over a year ago.

Tariqul Alam Tuhin, also former president of Sharsha upazila unit of Bangladesh Chhatra League, has remained traceless since he disappeared on March 7 last year.

"During the few days before Tuhin's disappearance, Rab men twice came to our residence and looked for Tuhin. They broke open the main gate and loudly called his name and ordered him to come out early March in 2013. That time a team of local policemen intervened and the Rab men went away," Salma said at the press conference at Benapole Bazar.

"Then Tuhin went to Dhaka and took shelter at the NAM flat residence of Jessore-1 lawmaker Sheikh Afil Uddin. But Tuhin disappeared on March 7, 2013 after he left the flat at 11:36am," Salma said.

"At 9:17am that day, my husband told me over phone that he was coming to Benapole from Dhaka by plane. But he never returned. From the earlier activities of Rab men, I suspect that they abducted my husband on his way to Dhaka Airport," Salma said.

Major Md Masudur Rahman, camp in-charge Rab-6 in Jessore, said, "Rab did not do the act. No such complaint was raised at that time."

Nuruzaman, general secretary of Sharsha upazila unit of AL, and Nasir Uddin, general secretary of Benapole municipality unit of AL, were also present at the press conference arranged by the municipality AL.
