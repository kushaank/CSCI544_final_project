
Eastern Europe should pay for its own prisoners, according to Jeppe Kofod (SocDem).

Danish prisons are overflowing with foreigners, who are both taking up space and costing the country DKK 200 million a year.

Many of them could be repatriated to serve their sentences at home, but especially the Eastern European countries have not implemented the 2008 EU agreement and refuse to take back their criminals.

“I would like to send the bill to those countries that should accept their own citizens,” said Jeppe Kofod, the Social Democratic Party candidate in the European elections to DR News.

The proposal comes after Bendt Bendtsen suggested last week that Denmark should provide funding for the training of prison personnel and the establishment of more prison cells in Eastern Europe.

However, Kofod does not agree.

It costs Danish prisons between DKK 1,100 and 1,800 per day per prisoner, whereas in Romania it only costs DKK 120.

Kofod thinks that the difference between the prices should be the impetus for Eastern European countries to take their prisoners back.
