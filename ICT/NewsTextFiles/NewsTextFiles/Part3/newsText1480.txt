SEOUL--South Korean President Park Geun-hye on Monday offered a tearful nationally televised apology over the fatal ferry sinking last month and outlined reforms to prevent a recurrence, including the disbanding of the coastguard.

The apology, given in an emotional 20 minute speech at the presidential office, came amid lingering widespread criticism of the government's response to the April 16 sinking, which has left more than 300 people dead or missing.

"As the president is responsible for the people's lives and safety, I offer my sincere apology for all the suffering that the people have undergone," Ms. Park said, before stepping to the side of the podium and bowing deeply.

"The final responsibility for failing to handle this case properly should lie with me," she said.

Ms. Park promised to conduct sweeping reforms to upgrade the country's safety standards, including strengthened safety drills and the creation of a new anti-disaster body to control all functions related to disaster management.

Ms. Park said the national coast guard, widely criticized for its handling of the Sewol ferry sinking, would be disbanded and integrated into the new anti-disaster body.

The country will designate April 16 as the National Safety Day to raise public awareness of safety, she said.

Ms. Park shed tears as she listed the names of some of those who had sacrificed their lives to save others during the disaster.

South Korea's state prosecution last week indicted four senior crew members, including the captain, on homicide charges, and 11 other crew members for negligence.
