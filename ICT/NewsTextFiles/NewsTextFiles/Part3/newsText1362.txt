
TOKYO, May 19 (KUNA) -- Japan and North Korea will hold government-level talks next week in the Swedish capital Stockholm, Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said Monday.

"We will take up a wide range of issues of our concern and firmly communicate with the North Korean side to draw a positive response from them," Kihida told reporters.

The minister also suggested that the agenda in the talks, due May 26-28, will include Pyongyang's abduction of Japanese nationals in the 1970s and 1980s and its nuclear weapons programs.

The two countries resumed inter-governmental talks in Beijing in March, the first such talks since November 2012.  North Korea admitted in 2002 to having abducted 13 Japanese nationals, and has maintained that the issue has been settled.

No tangible progress has been seen on the issue since five of them were repatriated to Japan in 2002.
