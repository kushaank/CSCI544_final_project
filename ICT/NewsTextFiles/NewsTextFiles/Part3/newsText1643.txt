
The New Hampshire police commissioner who called President Barack Obama the N-word has resigned, USA Today , WMUR-TV and other news outlets reported.

Robert Copeland, police commissioner for the predominantly white town of Wolfeboro, gave his letter of resignation to Town Manager David Owen on Monday, the same day Mitt Romney called Copeland's words a "vile epithet" and demanded he apologize.

"The vile epithet used and confirmed by the commissioner has no place in our community," the former Republican presidential candidate said according to WMUR-TV . "He should apologize and resign."

Copeland, 82, previously said he would not apologize for using the racial slur when the news broke last week. A Wolfeboro resident, Jane O'Toole, heard Copeland call Obama the N-word while at a restaurant in March. She reported the incident to the town manager.

"It's not like I was eavesdropping. Mr. Copeland was being very loud," O'Toole said according to WMUR-TV.

Copeland, who is white, admitted to using the slur in an email to O'Toole and other police commissioners.

"I believe I did use the 'N' word in reference to the current occupant of the Whitehouse," Copeland wrote in the email, the AP reported. "For this, I do not apologize- he meets and exceeds my criteria for such."

Outraged residents immediately called for Copeland's resignation, slamming the commissioner for representing the town in a negative light. Some residents even wore stickers with the word "Resign" on their shirts at a town meeting after the incident. Copeland attended the meeting, but remained silent with his arms crossed.

Out of Wolfeboro's 6,300 residents, about 20 are black, according to the AP.
