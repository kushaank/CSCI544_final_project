
Yusuf Yerkel was signed off for a week after being diagnosed with soft tissue trauma.

He refused to apologise yesterday to his victim, who had been held by police as Mr Yerkel unleashed a number of kicks at his body.

“I have been deeply saddened by the incident that occurred in Soma on May 14. I am sorry for being unable to keep calm despite all the provocations, insults and attacks I faced on that day,” he said.

Mr Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party spokesman Huseyin Celik claimed that it was impossible to establish the truth from just a photograph.

He suggested that the man Mr Yerkel kicked could have attacked him beforehand.
