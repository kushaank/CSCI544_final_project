A Connecticut high school student didn't get Joe Biden as a prom date, but did receive a note and a vice presidential corsage.

"I am flattered, but my schedule will not permit me to be in Connecticut on Friday evening," Biden said in the note to Newington High School student Talia Maselli, reports The Hartford Courant .

"But I hope you will accept this corsage and enjoy your prom as much as I did mine," Biden added.

Maselli told the Courant that she sent a prom invitation to the vice president seven months ago for a very simple reason.

"Joe Biden makes me laugh," she said. "He just cracks me up."

In her note, Maselli wrote: "I am inviting you so far in advance because I'm sure many 17-year-old girls send you prom invitations, and I had to beat them to it. I could only tolerate a high school dance if I was to be escorted by the most delightful man in America."

Last week, on the eve of the prom, Maselli received the note and corsage from Biden, who also invited Maselli to the White House.

"Maselli's first thought was that someone was playing an elaborate practical joke on her. She even called her mother to ask if she was in on it.

"'She had no idea what I was talking about,' Maselli said.

"Then she called a number for Biden's assistant that was on a separate card. The assistant immediately recognized Maselli's name, and Maselli realized the corsage and the note were real.

"A day later, Maselli and her family were still in shock.

She didn't go to the prom.

"'But,'" she said, "'If he had said yes, I would have gone.'"
