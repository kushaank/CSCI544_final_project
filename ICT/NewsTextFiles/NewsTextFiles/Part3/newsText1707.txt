
A federal judge struck down Oregon's gay marriage ban on Monday and Multnomah County clerks immediately began issuing marriage licenses.

U.S. District Judge Michael McShane ruled that the ban was unconstitutional and discriminatory and it didn't seem to have "any rationally related government purpose," reports the Los Angeles Times .

Same-sex marriage supporters were prepared in case McShane went against every other federal judge to rule on gay marriage bans as they had gathered enough signatures to place a measure on the ballot.

"It's a surreal exciting moment not just for Oregon but for our nation," one plaintiff, Ben West said. "It's a beautiful moment for all families and all communities. I'm proud to be an Oregonian."

Once the decision was announced, county clerks in Multnomah County began issuing marriage licenses to those waiting.

As previously reported , McShane announced on Friday that he would be revealing his decision today. State officials also revealed that they were prepared to let same-sex couples immediately apply for marriage licenses once the ruling came down.

Oregon Attorney General Ellen F. Rosenblum previously said she would not back the law, which went undefended during arguments last week.
