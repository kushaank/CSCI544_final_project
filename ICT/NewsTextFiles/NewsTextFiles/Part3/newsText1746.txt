
Osun State Government has prohibited indiscriminate use of sirens within the state, describing the act as uncivilized.

The state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Sunday Akere, who announced this yesterday said the governor had signed a document to enforce the order.

Akere hinted that the governor had through the action exercised the powers vested on him by the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) and Section 10(2) of the Police Act, Cap. P19,Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2010.

According to Akere, those exempted from the ban include the Police, Ambulances, Fire-fighters and the Armed Forces, who by the nature of their calling are mandated to use sirens in the cause of their duties.

Akere declared that nobody should use siren henceforth within the territorial boundary of the state except those authorised to do so under the law.

He stressed that any individual or organisation that contravened the letters of the document should be prepared to face the wrath of the law.
