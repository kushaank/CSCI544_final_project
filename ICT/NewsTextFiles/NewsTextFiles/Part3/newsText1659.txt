
With a possible strike looming, Kaiser Permanente officials and union representatives said Sunday night no deal had been reached over a new contract for pharmacists.

Some 1,430 pharmacists working for Kaiser Permanente facilities across Southern California will strike at 7 a.m. today if a deal isn’t reached, said Robin Borden, president of the Guild for Professional Pharmacists.

Negotiations could go on through the night, Borden said.

But that didn’t happen to the other groups, Borden said.

Kaiser Permanente has more than 40 hospitals statewide. Its Southern Calfiornia facilities include: Woodland Hills, Panorama City, East Hollywood, Downey, Baldwin Park, West Los Angeles, Fontana and Ontario.

Kaiser Permanente Southern California spokeswoman Sandra D. Hernandez-Millett said arrangements have been made with other stores in case of a strike. Patients can go to Walgreens; Wal-Mart; Target; CVS; Caremark; Rite Aid; Vons; and Ralphs to service new and refill prescription needs, she said.

Members can also do mail order refills through kp.org . Those refills are expected to take 7 to 10 business days to arrive.
