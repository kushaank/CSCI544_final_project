
The Transport Secretary, Anthony Cheung Bing-leung, says he will resign immediately if an inquiry finds him responsible for the two-year delay in constructing the Hong Kong-Guangzhou high-speed rail link.

The official also insisted that he had not colluded with the MTR Corporation to cover-up the delay, saying he had never put political considerations ahead of his professional judgement.
