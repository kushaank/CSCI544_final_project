
A Virginia man was sentenced to prison last week for lying to a federal grand jury about his role in a scheme to defraud Eastman Chemical Co.

David Wayne Grigsby, 48, of Wise, Va., was sentenced to 12 months and one day in prison. U.S. District Judge J. Ronnie Greer also find Grigsby $4,000.

Since there is no parole in the federal system, Grigsby will serve the entire term, followed by three years of supervised probation.

Grigsby was charged with three counts of making false declarations to the grand jury. A trial jury found that his testimony to the grand jury was false. He had told the grand jury that he was unaware of a scheme to defraud, and denied any involvement in the collection of false samples of coal that were submitted to an independent testing service to defraud Eastman Chemical, which is headquartered in Kingsport.

At trial, federal authorities played audio recordings suggesting that he had instructed employees of the independent testing service to submit false samples of coal for testing.

Employees of the testing service also testified that he had directed the collection of false samples of coal.
