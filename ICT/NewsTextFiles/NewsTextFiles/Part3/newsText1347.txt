
Copeland had been facing intense pressure to resign after a resident complained about overhearing him use the N-word in a restaurant. Copeland acknowledged that he used the slur but refused to apologize or step down.

Town and state officials -- along with some national figures, such as Mitt Romney, who has a home in Wolfeboro -- had condemned the remark, and more than 100 residents packed a Police Commission meeting last week to demand Copleand's resignation.

"Mr. Copeland certainly did not represent the town of Wolfeboro," said Town Manager Dave Owen. "The town of Wolfeboro is a very welcoming community."

Copeland had been re-elected to a three-year term in March. Officials said resignation was the only way to get him out of office before the end of his term because the state has no recall provision for elected officials.

As a member of the Police Commission, Copeland oversaw certain police policies but was not a member of the Police Department.

"He did a bad thing," said Police Commission Chairman Joseph Balboni. "What he did was not right. We tried to make him resign before all of this."

After stories about the slur spread nationwide, town officials and the Police Department were slammed with phone calls from people saying they would boycott the town, a popular summer destination, until Copeland resigned.

Balboni and the other commissioner will appoint a new commissioner, who must be a registered voter who has lived in the town for at least five years.
