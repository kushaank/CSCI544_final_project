
MANAMA: J Equity Partners, Alpine Wealth Management, Tadhamon Capital, PineBridge Investments Middle East and The Family Office Company have come together to form the first Bahrain Asset Managers Association.

J Equity Partners chief executive Dr Ahmed Al Jawhary told a Press conference at the Gulf Hotel yesterday that the procedural aspects of the association had been completed, which would work under the ambit of the Central Bank of Bahrain.

Membership of the association was open to all three categories of licenced investment firms, both Sharia-compliant and conventional, he said.

The idea behind the formation of the association was to secure specialised representation for investment firms which so far have been under the umbrella of the Bahrain Bankers Association.
