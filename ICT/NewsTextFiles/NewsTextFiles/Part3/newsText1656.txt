NORTH RIDGEVILLE, Ohio -- More than 100 angry city residents jammed North Ridgeville City Hall tonight to complain about the city's reactions to last week's flood which dumped several feet of water in homes in several parts of the city.

Before the start of the meeting, residents talked among themselves about the flood, maintaining that they had the same problem going back to at least 1989.

"My basement was full of water and I had two foot of water in my first floor," said Barb Sutton of Gina Drive. "Any my house was full of muddy water and human excrement. It was disgusting."

The last time it flooded, March of 2012, Sutton said it cost her $19,000 to clean up.
