
A Tory MP today said it was time the Government took “its foot off the accelerator” of London’s housing market.

Mark Field said the Coalition’s flagship Help to Buy scheme should be scaled down in the capital due to fears its housing market is “overheating”.

He warned that huge rises in house prices, fuelled by Help to Buy, were lifting the London property ladder out of reach for many.

Mr Field also said uncertainty over the housing market could damage investor confidence in the UK. But the MP said Help to Buy should continue outside London, where the housing market is still getting back on its feet.

Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said yesterday he was ready to advise ministers on changing Help to Buy, which helps people get a deposit to purchase a property.

It comes as a survey showed average asking prices in London were soaring, up 16 per cent on last year.

Cities of London and Westminster MP Mr Field said: “If you can scale [Help to Buy] back in London then most of us would feel the capital’s property market no longer needs substantial outside help. Because it is rising so fast it is taking people out of reach of the property ladder.

Mr Carney warned yesterday that the housing market posed a risk to Britain’s economic recovery.

He added: “The level of higher loan-to-income mortgages, ones above four and a half, five times loan-to-income, potentially could store up bigger problems for the future and we need to be careful.” Property website Rightmove found the average UK asking price jumped nine per cent on a year ago, rising to £272,003 in May.

Prices in London rose more than 16 per cent over the same period, with the average asking price hitting £592,763.
