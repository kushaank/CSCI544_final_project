
Korean-Americans across major cities in the United States, including Washington, New York, Los Angeles and Atlanta, participated in rallies over the weekend criticizing the Korean government of its handling of the Sewol ferry disaster.

In Washington, about 120 people rallied in front of the Lincoln Memorial around 2 p.m. on Sunday after paying their respects to the victims of the accident. The group demanded that the Korean government take responsibility for the accident.

The demonstrations came ahead of President Park Geun-hye’s official apology yesterday morning in Seoul in a nationally televised address, which included an announcement detailing measures that would overhaul the national safety system.

Other protesters held up handwritten signs on yellow poster paper with a range of messages criticizing the government and media censorship. A few called for President Park to resign. Others expressed condolences for the victims, who were mostly high school students.

Rally organizers in New York said that people in cities across 39 states participated in the rallies.

Missy USA, a lifestyle website for married Korean-American women that was responsible for The New York Times advertisement that ran earlier this month criticizing the Park administration, had a hand in organizing the rallies. Posters on the website coordinated rallies in different cities by time zone.

The Korean-American community ran a full-page advertisement in The New York Times last week called “Bring the Truth to Light,” in which they lashed out at the Park government for its poor handling of the disaster.

Missy USA helped raise more than $160,000 from more than 4,000 donors through a crowd-funding website.
