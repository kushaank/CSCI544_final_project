
TOKYO, May 19 (KUNA) -- The first of the four ships China has dispatched to evacuate its nationals affected in the recent violence in Vietnam left the Vietnamese port on Monday with 989 evacuees, state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.

The passenger vessel is expected to arrive in China on Tuesday morning, the report said. Four Chinese ships, each with an accommodation capacity of about 1,000 passengers, have been sent to bring home some 4,000 Chinese nationals, and two others are on stand-by. Some wounded Chinese workers have already been flown home aboard two chartered flights.

Central and southern Vietnamese provinces witnessed a spate of violent protests against  foreign companies last week, which left at least two Chinese dead and more than 100 injured.

Beijing has condemned the violence and demanded that Vietnam take resolute and effective measures to stop all violence, ensure the safety of all Chinese nationals and companies, punish all perpetrators and compensate affected Chinese companies and nationals.

The protests came after China deployed an oil rig in a disputed area of the South China Sea, which led to collisions between the two countries' ships.

On Sunday, China said it will suspend some of its plans for bilateral exchanges with Vietnam in response to the deadly violence against Chinese nationals in the country. China has also lifted the level of security warning for Chinese tourists in Vietnam, warning its citizens not to travel to the country, the Foreign Ministry said, according to Xinhua.
