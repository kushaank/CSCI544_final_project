
Four Chinese passenger ships arrived in Vietnam on Monday to evacuate Chinese citizens following anti-China riots in the neighboring country, according to state-run media.

The ships will be used to evacuate some 4,000 Chinese nationals after Vietnamese mobs last week attacked foreign companies believed to be Chinese-run, leaving two Chinese dead and over 100 injured, Xinhua News Agency reported.

Over 3,000 Chinese left the country over the weekend, with an additional 300 evacuating by plane on Sunday to the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu, according to the Foreign Ministry.

The ministry said Sunday that China has suspended some bilateral exchanges with Vietnam in the wake of the violence and "will consider taking further steps depending on how the situation plays out."

Rioters in central and southern Vietnam vented their rage last week over Beijing's decision to send an oil rig into disputed waters near the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea.
