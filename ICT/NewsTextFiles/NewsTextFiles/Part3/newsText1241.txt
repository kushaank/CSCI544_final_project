
THE Queensland Government believes it was “impossible to legislate” against the systemic failures which led to the rape and abuse of 13 students at a Queensland school which went unreported.

In a submission to the Royal Commission into child sexual abuse, the State Government submitted what happened at the school was the result of failures of individuals.

“The failures, it is submitted, were primarily of individuals not following existing procedure. Something which is impossible to legislate against,’’ the 13-page submission from the government read.

Key parties in the Queensland sittings have made formal submissions to the commission as they wait for recommendations from the evidence.

School principal Terence Hayes failed to report the offences of teacher Gerard Byrnes who raped and assaulted the children. In her submission, learning support teacher and student protection contact Catherine Long said she “genuinely believed” Mr Hayes would follow through on allegations.

“At no time did Mrs Long ‘water down’ this allegation (irrespective of “the demonstration”) and presented her a written note of the verbal disclosures to the Principal on her clear understanding that the Principal would take advice on the contents of that note from the Student Protection Officer,’’ the submission from her legal team said.

Last week it was revealed the Catholic Church accused Mr Hayes of lying to the Commission and should not be considered a credible witness.

He claimed it was not procedure to report the allegations to police, instead it should go to Catholic Education.

Submissions on behalf of the church parties apologised for what took place at the school.
