
The US missile cruiser Vella Gulf is expected to arrive in the Black Sea on May 23, a military source told a Russian news agency. Another NATO vessel is already in the area, while the French Navyâ€™s stealth frigate will reportedly be there by late May.

This comes as part of a wider buildup of NATO forces close to   Russian borders against the backdrop of the Ukraine crisis.

The American Aegis guided missile cruiser will be in the Black   Sea in time for the Ukrainian presidential elections on May 25, a   military-diplomatic source told Russiaâ€™s Itar-Tass news agency on   Monday.

â€œIt is expected that Vella Gulf will pass through the Black   Sea straits on May 23. According to available data, the ship will   be performing the tasks of US Navy command in the eastern part of   the Black Sea,â€� the source said.

Another NATO vessel â€“ a French stealth frigate, The Surcouf â€“ is   expected to enter the Black Sea between May 28 and May 29,   reports RIA Novosti, also citing a military-diplomatic source.

Vella Gulf and The Surcouf will join the French Navy's   intelligence ship, Dupuy de Lome, which is currently in the   waters off Bulgariaâ€™s port city of Varna. The vessel, designed   for radar monitoring and capable of intercepting communications,   including phone calls and e-mails, entered the Black Sea on May   14. Dupuy de Lome had also been present in the area from April 11   to April 30, a Russian Navy Main Staff spokesman told Interfax   last week.

The US ship Vella Gulf is 172 meters long and 16 meters wide and   can carry two multipurpose helicopters. It is also equipped with   an Aegis air and ballistic missile defensive system, Tomahawk   cruise missiles, antisubmarine missiles, as well as Standard-2   and Standard-3 surface-to-air missiles.

Vella Gulf will have to leave the Black Sea no later than June 13   as, according to the Montreux Convention, non-riparian, military   vessels are only allowed to stay in the region for 21 days. It   will replace US warship USS Donald Cook which left the Black Sea   at the end of April.

The Russian Foreign Ministry has previously accused NATO of   violating the Montreux Convention, claiming the USS Taylor spent   11 more days than the limit in the region in February and March.

The expected deployment of the missile cruiser comes as NATO   forces are beefing up their presence in Eastern Europe because of   the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. Western leaders have accused   Russia of purposely destabilizing its neighbor, something that   the Russian government has categorically denied.

Last week, the Ukraineâ€™s coup-appointed government deployed   15,000 troops on its border with Russia, provoking a sharp rebuke   from Moscow which said Ukraine and NATO were not contributing to   de-escalating the crisis in the region. Russiaâ€™s Deputy Defense   Minister Anatoly Antonov said that Russian troops had been pulled   back from the border zone.

However, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen insisted on   Thursday that there had been no movement of Russian troops.

â€œI have very good vision but while we've noted Russiaâ€™s   statement so far we haven't seen any - any - indication of troops   pulling back,â€� Rasmussen said on his Twitter. â€œIf we saw   visible signs of a meaningful pullback by Russia troops, I'd be   the first one to welcome it,â€� he added.

Elsewhere, in Eastern Europe, NATO has significantly increased   its military presence and embarked on military drills. Earlier   this month, the alliance began a 6,000-strong troop exercise   called â€˜Spring Stormâ€™ in Estonia â€“ the biggest since 2003 when   the drill was first held.

Russia has condemned NATOâ€™s activities and branded them as a   provocation and not contributing to the normalization of the   situation in Ukraine.

Pr etty ignorant, aren't you? Plenty of Pakistanis and other Arabs fighting in Afghanistan. Hardly "peasants"

Same with Vietnam. Plenty of Chinese aid given to the NVA, not to mention the staging areas in Cambodia and Laos.

You see, just because you can reduce the whole country to a pile of smoldering rubble doesn't mean that that is what you do.
