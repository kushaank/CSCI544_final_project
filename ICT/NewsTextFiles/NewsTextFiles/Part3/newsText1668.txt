
A New Hampshire police commissioner resigned Monday after growing calls for his departure following reports he called President Barack Obama the N-word, New Hampshire’s Wolfeboro Police Department confirmed.

Robert Copeland, 82, resigned Monday, a dispatch supervisor for the Wolfeboro Police Department confirmed. A statement from the department’s chairman, Joe Balboni Jr., is expected to be released later Monday.

A resident of the New Hampshire town filed a complaint in March that she overheard Copeland using the racial slur to describe the president. Copeland, one member of a three-member police commission, did not refute his use of the word in an email he wrote to his fellow commissioners, according to reports last week.

Mitt Romney joined the growing number demanding Copeland’s resignation as well as New Hampshire lawmakers including Sens. Kelly Ayotte and Jeanne Shaheen, as well as Gov. Maggie Hassan and Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, the Washington Post reported Monday.
