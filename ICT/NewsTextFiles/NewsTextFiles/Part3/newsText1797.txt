
Hili land port users, who continued strike to realise their three-point demand for the fifth day yesterday, will enforce a daylong hartal in Hakimpur upazila today.

 Yesterday, they blocked Dinajpur-Joypurhat Road at Hili intersection for three hours from 10:00amn.

The port users--Hili Land port C & F Agents Association, Customs Association, Truck Operators Association, Truck Driver Association and workers Federation--began an indefinite strike on May 14 to press the demands.

The demands are putting an end to giving seal on the manifest of imported goods, harassment by members of Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), and filing of cases by BGB without informing the C&F agents and importers.

Abul Kashem Azad, president of Hili Land Port C & F Agents Association, has threatened to launch a toughen agitation programme at the land port in Hakimpur upazila of the district if their demands are not met immediately.

 Some users have already shifted their business to other land ports because of harassment of BGB personnel in Hili port area in the name of checking documents, Azad alleged.

Refuting allegation of harassment, Abdur Razzak Tarafdar, commanding officer BGB Joypurhat-3 Battalion, said the border guards would continue checking the documents as per customs law and for the sake of security.

 Around 3,000 labourers at the port have become jobless as loading and unloading of goods have remained suspended since Wednesday morning.

 Md Moniruzzaman Assistant customs officer of Hili land port, said the government is incurring a loss of Tk 1 crore in revenue each day for the strike.

Contacted, Ahmed Shamim Al Razi, deputy commissioner of Dinajpur, said they are talking separately with the port users and BGB members. 'I hope the crisis will be resolved within day or two' said the DC.
