
The Senate blue ribbon committee on Monday has postponed its hearing on another anomaly supposedly involving alleged pork barrel scam mastermind Janet Lim-Napoles: the P900-million Malampaya Fund scam.

Senator Teofisto Guingona III's office said in a media advisory that the hearing on the alleged Malampaya Fund scam, which was scheduled for Thursday, "has been postponed to a later date."

His office said the hearing will be deferred because of the "unavailability of our resource person from the Commission on Audit".

Last week, the senator announced that the panel will shift its focus to the Malampaya Fund scam after the committee recommended plunder charges against Senators Ramon Bong Revilla Jr., Jinggoy Estrada and Juan Ponce Enrile in connection with the alleged pork barrel scam.

Senate Majority Leader Alan Peter Cayetano said he was not pleased with the postponement of the Malampaya Fund scam hearing.

"I'm very disappointed [that] we cancelled the hearing on Malampaya. It would have been an opportunity, na kahit iba yung hearing, na ipatawag si Mrs. Napoles," Cayetano said.

Napoles, former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and 20 others are currently facing plunder complaints before the Office of the Ombudsman for allegedly pocketing millions in kickbacks from royalties derived from the Malampaya gas field project off the coast of Palawan.

In an unsigned affidavit submitted last week to the Senate blue ribbon committee, Napoles accused government witness Ruby Tuason of orchestrating the P900-million Malampaya Fund scam .
