A New Hampshire police commissioner who used a racial slur to describe President Barack Obama has resigned, the town's chief of police said Monday.

"He has finally done the right thing," Wolfeboro (N.H.) Police Chief Stuart Chase said in a phone interview. "We had hundreds of calls from as far away as Alaska and even international, and they considered what he said reprehensible; the magnitude of this exceeds anything we could ever imagine."

A call to the home of the elected commissioner, 82-year-old Robert Copeland, was unanswered Monday.

Mr. Copeland, who recently had been re-elected to a three-year term, resigned in an email Sunday night, Joe Balboni, chairman of the Wolfeboro Police Commission, said in a statement Monday. Mr. Balboni added that the outcome was in the best interest of the town.

"We've got a lot of healing to do in this town," he said.

The incident propelled the small resort community into the national spotlight after a local resident complained that she overheard Mr. Copeland loudly use the N-word to describe the president when his image appeared on television at a restaurant. Mr. Copeland acknowledged in an email to fellow commissioners that he had used the word and made no apologies.

Last week, residents packed a televised town meeting urging Mr. Copeland to resign, but he sat quietly, arms crossed. A couple of residents supported him. After the meeting, he said, "I admitted what I did. I made no bones about it," according to television news clips.

On Sunday, Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts governor, echoed calls for Mr. Copeland to resign.

The White House has declined to weigh in on the matter. "I haven't spoken about it with [Mr. Obama] and I really don't have a comment," White House press secretary Jay Carney said Monday at a news briefing.

Wolfeboro is a town of nearly 6,300 residents near the popular tourist spot Lake Winnipesaukee. The state is 94% white, and 1% black, according to U.S. Census figures. Mr. Copeland was one of three police commissioners, who hire, fire and establish compensation for police officers.

Mr. Chase, the police chief, said Mr. Copeland's comments have unfairly put a cloud over Wolfeboro's 13-member police force. "It has painted us with a broad brush and damaged the image and perhaps the mission of our agency," he said. "It's reprehensible."
