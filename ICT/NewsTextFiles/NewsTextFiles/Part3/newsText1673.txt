
On Sunday the Centers for Disease Control announced that they would be using their handbook on SARS, the deadly virus outbreak that took place in 2003, to figure out how to deal with the growing death toll from MERS.

MERS, which stands for Middle East respiratory syndrome, was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, and since has been responsible for 173 deaths, with three identified cases in the United States. Officials believe the virus originated from camels, which carry a strain of the disease in their blood. Human to human infection is low, although there is a risk a more contagious strand could mutate.

In comparison, the SARS virus, orÂ severe acute respiratory syndrome killed 774 people in the early 2000s, and spread easily through human to human contact. While the death toll and contagion level for SARS is higher than MERS, officials are even more concerned by the potential of a MERS pandemic, since so far one in three who have contracted the illness have died. In comparison SARS resulted in death for one in 10 patients.

IdentifyingÂ patients quickly and determining who's at risk.Â As with SARS, MERS seems to be disproportionately affecting healthcare workers treating others for the virus. The elderly are also at increased risk.

â€œA lot of the transmission in SARS was in healthcare settings and healthcare workers who were providing care to people who got sick and that is what weâ€™re seeing with MERS,â€� CDC spokesperson Thomas Skinner told The Hill. Â â€œOver the past couple of years weâ€™ve been working with state health departments and hospital associations to prepare for the arrival of this virus."

Preparing andÂ distributing MERS test kits.Â As soon as first cases of MERS occurred in 2012, the CDC worked to develop a test kit, which has since been distributed throughout state health departments. Localities that don't have access to a test kit can ship samples to the CDC for testing.

Activating an Emergency Operations Center.Â After the first few reported cases of MERS, the CDC established an Emergency Operations Center based in Indiana. CDC officials working through this center track down the people an infected individual may have come in contact with in order to decrease the spread of the virus.

Last week the CDC also began posting signage in airports warning unsuspecting passengers the dangers of traveling in a plane with someone infected by MERS. It urged all travelers to seek medical attention immediately if they started developing any flu-like symptoms following their trip.
