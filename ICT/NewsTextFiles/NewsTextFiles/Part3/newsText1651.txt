
SAN DIEGO -- All evacuation orders were lifted Sunday as firefighters gained the upper hand on the remaining four of nearly a dozen blazes that tore through Southern California last week -- while the state's governor warned he was gearing up for what could be the region's worst wildfire season.

Gov. Jerry Brown told ABC's "This Week" that the state has 5,000 firefighters and has appropriated $600 million to battling blazes, but that might not be enough.

"We're getting ready for the worst," Brown said. "Now, we don't want to anticipate before we know, but we need a full complement of firefighting capacity."

Unusually high temperatures, low humidity and gusty winds set conditions last week for the string of wildfires that broke out in San Diego County, causing more than $20 million in damage.
