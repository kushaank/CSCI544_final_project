The boss of AstraZeneca said there was no prospect of a deal with US drug giant Pfizer before a set deadline of May 26.

Chairman Leif Johansson also said there was no likelihood of a deadline extension, under rules laid down by the Takeover Panel.

Mr Johansson said that it was Pfizer, not AstraZeneca, that called an end to discussions on Sunday afternoon about a potential takeover to create the world's largest drug maker.

Early Monday morning AstraZeneca announced a rejection of Pfizer's "final offer" takeover bid, which valued the company at £69.3bn ($119bn).

The British drug firm said the offer of £55 a share falls short of its value as an independent company and that its larger US rival had failed to "make a compelling strategic business or value case".

It said the Pfizer proposals would bring "uncertainty and risks" for AstraZeneca shareholders.

Mr Johansson told Sky News: "We rejected the bid on three grounds. First, we think it undervalues the opportunities we think AstraZeneca could have as an independent company.

"Secondly, we think there is a long, drawn-out process, with very considerable execution risk ... and thirdly, we think there is a clearly disruptive element in how we can best create value for shareholders and society by disrupting the way we get medicines to the market."

On Sunday, Pfizer told AstraZeneca it had until 5pm on May 26 to make a decision.

Mr Johansson said he had had made it clear that his board could only recommend a bid that was at least 10% above an offer of £53.50 made by Pfizer on Friday evening.

AstraZeneca shares plunged by more than 14% in early Monday trading, driving its market value down to £52.1bn, £17bn less than the value Pfizer had put on the company.

On May 2, New York-based Pfizer made an offer of £63bn ($106bn) for AstraZeneca, which the board rejected "without hesitation" .

Investors backed AstraZeneca in rejecting the cash-and-stock approach worth £50 a share, but many said they would want it to engage if Pfizer came back with an improved offer.

Pfizer has said it will not make a hostile offer directly to AstraZeneca shareholders, and would only proceed with an offer with the recommendation of AstraZeneca's board.

Sky News City Editor Mark Kleinman said: "The AstraZeneca board has highlighted the inherent risks in doing a deal with Pfizer at any price - the risk to jobs that would be triggered from a merger of this kind.

"But unusually in AstraZeneca's statement, it has put a price tag on itself ... it says it would only be prepared to make a recommendation to shareholders if the board of Pfizer were to make an offer that was at least 10% above the £53.50 per share that was made privately on Friday.

"That would put a price tag on AstraZeneca of about £59 a share - well over £70bn."

The latest rejected bid increased the cash element to 45%, with AstraZeneca shareholders set to receive 1.747 shares in the enlarged company for each of their AstraZeneca shares and 2.476p in cash.

Pfizer wants to create the world's largest drugs company, with its headquarters in New York and a tax base in Britain.

The Board of AstraZeneca PLC ("AstraZeneca" or the "Company") notes the announcement by Pfizer Inc. ("Pfizer") of its final proposal (the "Final Proposal"), comprising £24.76 in cash (45%) and 1.747 Pfizer shares (55%) per AstraZeneca share, representing a value of £55.00 per AstraZeneca share (based on the closing price of Pfizer shares on 16 May 2014).

This proposal undervalues the Company and its attractive prospects and has been rejected by the Board of AstraZeneca.

Leif Johansson, Chairman of AstraZeneca said: "Pascal Soriot, Marc Dunoyer and I had a lengthy discussion with Pfizer over the weekend about the proposal Pfizer made on Friday evening at a value of £53.50 per share.

"During this discussion, Pfizer said that it could consider only minor improvements in the financial terms of the Friday Proposal. In response, we indicated, even assuming that other key aspects of any proposal had been satisfactory, that the price at which the Board of AstraZeneca would be prepared to provide a recommendation would have to be more than 10% above the level contained in Pfizer's Friday Proposal.

"The Final Proposal is a minor improvement which continues to fall short of the Board's view of value and has been rejected."

"Pfizer's approach throughout its pursuit of AstraZeneca appears to have been fundamentally driven by the corporate financial benefits to its shareholders of cost savings and tax minimisation.

"From our first meeting in January to our latest discussion yesterday, and in the numerous phone calls in between, Pfizer has failed to make a compelling strategic, business or value case.

"The Board is firm in its conviction as to the appropriate terms to recommend to shareholders."

"AstraZeneca has created a culture of innovation, with science at the heart of its operations, which will continue to create significant value for patients, shareholders and all stakeholders of AstraZeneca."

"As an independent company, the entire value of AstraZeneca's pipeline will accrue to our shareholders. Under Pfizer's Final Proposal, this value would be significantly diluted."

"We have rejected Pfizer's Final Proposal because it is inadequate and would present significant risks for shareholders, while also having serious consequences for the Company, our employees and the life-sciences sector in the UK, Sweden and the US."

After the close of business on 16 May 2014, the Board received a letter containing a revised non-binding proposal from Pfizer comprising £21.57 in cash (40%) and 1.845 Pfizer shares (60%) per AstraZeneca share, representing a value of £53.50 per AstraZeneca share (based on the closing price of Pfizer shares on 16 May 2014) (the "Friday Proposal").

Pfizer's letter did not provide detail about other key aspects of its proposal, several of which are of importance to the Board's evaluation.

The Board of AstraZeneca met on 17 May 2014 and concluded that the financial terms of the Friday Proposal substantially undervalued the Company and its attractive prospects. Accordingly, the Friday Proposal was rejected.

The Board wrote to Pfizer on the evening of 17 May 2014 to confirm that the Board had rejected the Friday Proposal.

The Board offered to hold a meeting with Pfizer to explain its views around the substantial shortfall in value of the Friday Proposal.

· The business operating model and segmentation which would allow AstraZeneca to deliver on its research and development pipeline and prospects; and which would protect and preserve its culture of science and innovation, especially given the likelihood of material cost savings and research and development reductions;

· The details of Pfizer's plans for cost savings, including around research and development, pipeline delivery and employment;

· Pfizer's plans for protecting the certainty of delivery of the value of any offer at closing.

Pfizer requested that this meeting be held by conference call. This conference call, between Leif Johansson (Chairman), Pascal Soriot (Chief Executive Officer) and Marc Dunoyer (Chief Financial Officer) of AstraZeneca and Ian Read (Chairman and CEO) and Frank D'Amelio (Chief Financial Officer) of Pfizer, took place on the afternoon of 18 May 2014.

The Chairman of Pfizer said that Pfizer could consider only minor improvements to the financial terms of the Friday Proposal.

The Chairman of AstraZeneca responded that, even if the other key aspects of the Friday Proposal had been satisfactory, the price at which the Board of AstraZeneca would be prepared to provide a recommendation would have to be more than 10% above the level contained in Pfizer's Friday Proposal. Pfizer stated that its Friday Proposal was final and would not be amended.

As a consequence the discussion ended.

The Board of AstraZeneca met on 18 May 2014 after this telephone discussion and reconfirmed its rejection of Pfizer's Friday Proposal.

A few hours later, without prior notice to AstraZeneca and contrary to its previous statement, Pfizer announced its Final Proposal to the market. The Board of AstraZeneca met again and rejected Pfizer's Final Proposal for reasons set out below.

· AstraZeneca has a growing and accelerating late stage pipeline, with aggregate risk-adjusted pipeline peak year sales potential of around $23 billion and non risk-adjusted pipeline peak year sales potential of around $63 billion;

· AstraZeneca's five key growth platforms are sustaining near-term growth, AstraZeneca remains confident that 2017 revenues should be broadly in line with 2013;

· AstraZeneca's core earnings growth is expected to be in excess of revenue growth during the period from 2017 to 2023 as a result of operating leverage.

AstraZeneca continues to demonstrate strong momentum across all elements of its strategy, as evidenced by multiple recent significant pipeline developments in its core therapy areas.

These pipeline developments, announced in 2014 after completion of the Company's 2013 Long Range Plan, underpin the Board's confidence in AstraZeneca's revenue targets due to increased probabilities of success for key oncology and other specialty franchise pipeline assets.

As a result, AstraZeneca's margins are expected to benefit from this improved revenue mix.

Given that AstraZeneca is at a point of inflection, the Board believes that selling AstraZeneca at the final price proposed by Pfizer would deprive shareholders of the value from potential future pipeline success.

Accordingly, the Board believes short term metrics, including premia over historical share prices, as referenced by Pfizer regarding the attractiveness of its proposals are not appropriate bases for assessing the value of AstraZeneca.

The majority of the consideration is in Pfizer shares which many AstraZeneca shareholders will be forced to sell. Further, for those AstraZeneca shareholders able to hold Pfizer shares, the Board believes Pfizer's proposals would materially alter the investment case and create risks and uncertainties.

· Pfizer's proposals are predicated on the delivery of significant cost reductions and imply a meaningful reduction in research and development potential and capabilities;

· The associated integration would risk significant disruption to the delivery and value of AstraZeneca's pipeline;

· Pfizer's announced business segmentation, if it were applied to AstraZeneca's business, would likely lead to value destruction.

In the context of the above, AstraZeneca notes the recent decline in Pfizer's share price, which has fallen by 5.3% since the release of Pfizer's Q1 2014 results.

The tax-driven inversion structure remains a key part of Pfizer's proposals. The inversion structure has already been the subject of intense public and governmental scrutiny, particularly in the US, as a result of Pfizer's possible offer for AstraZeneca. The Board believes this structure brings increased uncertainty as regards the delivery of value for AstraZeneca shareholders.

The Board believes that Pfizer's Final Proposal, in relation to price, form of consideration and the four particular points that are central to the Board's concerns around value, remains inadequate. Accordingly, the Board has rejected the Final Proposal.

This statement is being made by AstraZeneca without prior agreement or approval of Pfizer.

It's more of a proposal than a bid, really. Pfizer has made it clear it wants to buy British-based AstraZeneca and that it will pay £63bn for it but there’s no official bid.

AstraZeneca has made it plain it's not interested, at least not for that amount, and the management haven’t even held talks.

No. Pfizer can raise its bid or launch a hostile takeover offer in which it appeals directly to AstraZeneca’s shareholders to sell up – which they may do thinking it is a better deal. Kerching.

It's made it pretty clear that buying AstraZeneca would allow it to be domiciled in the UK so it can pay tax to the British Government.

Corporation tax in the UK is 20% from next year but in the US companies pay 38% of profits in similar taxes.

Uncertainty and potentially job losses - Pfizer's boss has admitted this.

There are real fears Pfizer will asset strip AstraZeneca leading to significant redundancies and substantial damage to British scientific research capabilities.

No, it has guaranteed it will base 20% of its worldwide research and development staff in Britain – not quite the same thing.

It won’t say how many people or where in the UK they will be based, although it has said it will keep AstraZeneca’s new Cambridge research facility.

In a way yes, in a way no. Under the Takeover Panel rules the guarantee is legally binding for one year although Pfizer insists it will honour its pledges for five years.

However, crucially, there is a clause that says these obligations could be changed “should circumstances significantly change” ie plenty of wriggle room.

In addition it takes 10 years for a drug to get from the lab to the doctor’s surgery so a five-year guarantee means little to Britain’s scientific researchers.

Ultimately no. The Enterprise Act only allows it to step in under the public interest test ie if it affects national security or financial stability – which it doesn’t.

Business Secretary Vince Cable has suggested the law could be changed to include scientific research and development as public interest.

In any event the final say goes to the European Commission and it will make the decision based on competition.

Don't forget while Pfizer is bigger than AstraZeneca, neither are small concerns. A merger will create a huge firm. It will represent the biggest ever takeover of a British firm by a foreign company.

There are very real concerns such big "big pharma" will completely ruin small science research outfits.

Remember AstraZeneca and Pfizer have sites all over this world, this is not just about the UK and US politicians have also raised concerns over jobs.

Well Pfizer will be paying tax to the Government and investing in Britain - all good.

And it says that the combined power of both companies will bring improved treatments for conditions such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes.

In addition, it is investment in science, which is key to the Government’s economic strategy.

MPs on House of Commons committees have been hearing from the firms and from unions worried about job cuts but ultimately that is just talk.

Under Takeover Panel rules having indicated its interest on April 26, Pfizer has until May 26 to make an official bid.
