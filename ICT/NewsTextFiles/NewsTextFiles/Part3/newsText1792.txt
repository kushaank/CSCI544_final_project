SHARE A CUPPA: Judith Duma with a gift from her friend who died of cancer.

After losing her mother, grandmother and, more recently, one of her closest friends to cancer, Ms Duma is mostly left with their memories.

But yesterday the East Maitland woman celebrated those lost lives at the Maitland Women’s Cancer Support Group’s Biggest Morning Tea.

“I’ve lost my mother, grandmother and close friends to cancer and this group has helped me a lot,” Ms Duma, who displayed her teapot ­collection as part of the event, said.

The support group – for ­cancer survivors and those who have cared for people with cancer – was launched five years ago and yesterday raised more than $300 for Australia’s Biggest Morning Tea.

“This group is all about having a safe place to come and to be among people who understand,” group founding member Sally Ewin said.

The group meets on the third Monday of the month at St Christopher’s Anglican Church Hall, Rutherford.
