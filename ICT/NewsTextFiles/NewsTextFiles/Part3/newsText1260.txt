
WASHINGTON -- The Northwest Branch Trail is supposed to be a pleasant hiker-biker  trail, but after a brutal murder last week, two civic groups say gang violence has  made it dangerous.

A man later identified as 19-year-old Akinley Osafa Warner died after a stabbing  on the Northwest Branch Trail on May 10.

The Maryland-National Capital Park Police said officers responded to a call at  about 11:30 p.m. about a man lying unconscious on the ground near the 1500 block  of Quebec Street in Langley Park.

They found Warner suffering from stab wounds to his upper body. He was pronounced  dead at the scene.

The Prince George's County NAACP and CASA of Maryland are calling on the Langley  Park community to improve safety on the trail.

Warner's death on the Northwest Branch Trail, said to be gang-related, has the  organizations working fight against gang violence, too.

On Monday night, a vigil will be held beginning at 7 p.m. at the CASA of Maryland  offices in Langley Park.

Three middle school students were arrested following the stabbing death.

Prince George's County Police and the Maryland-National Capital Park Police are  investigating Warner's death.
