
I resign.

Bob Copeland"

Town and state officials -- along with some national figures, such as Mitt Romney, who has a home in Wolfeboro -- had condemned the remark, and more than 100 residents packed a Police Commission meeting last week to demand Copeland's resignation.

Copeland had been re-elected to a three-year term in March. Officials said resignation was the only way to get him out of office before the end of his term because the state has no recall provision for elected officials.

After stories about the slur spread nationwide, town officials and the police department were flooded with phone calls from people saying they would boycott the town, a popular summer destination, until Copeland resigned.

TAKES ITS COURSE. FOR TEAM 5 INVESTIGATES, I'M KAREN ANDERSON. THE POLICE COMMISSIONER IN WOLF BORROW, NEW HAMPSHIRE RESIGNING AFTER THE RACIAL SLUR AGAINST THE PRESIDENT ANGERED PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND NEW AT 6:00, NEWSCENTER5'S JOHN ATWATER IS LIVE IN WOLFBOROUGH. JOHN? THIS HAS BEEN BOILING OVER FOR WEEKS HERE. THE RESIGNATION MADE OFFICIAL AND CAME VIA E-MAIL. H IS THE RESIGNATION LETTER HERE. ONLY TWO WORDS LONG. I RESIGN. THAT IS ALL THE POLICE COMMISSIONER ROBERT COPELAND WROTE TO THE POLICE COMMISSION AFTER MOUNTING PRESSURE TO GIVE UP HIS POST. NOTABLY ABSENT FROM THE E-MAIL AN APOLOGY. I DON'T KNOW IF THE COMMISSIONER HAS IT IN HIM TO APOLOGIZE. YOU KNOW, HE COULD HAVE CUT THIS WHOLE THING SHORT EARLY ON BY JUST SAYING I'M SORRY, I APOLOGIZE. I SAID SOMETHING I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID. THE 82-YEAR-OLD WHO IS ONE OF THREE ELECTED COMMISSIONERS DREW CRITICISM FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY AFTER A WOMAN HEARD HIM REFER TO PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA USING THE N WORD IN A RESTAURANT. WHAT MADE PEOPLE EVEN ANGRY REMEMBER, HE ADMITTED TO IT AND FLATLY REFUSED ANY APOLOGY. I ADMITTED WHAT I DID. I MADE MO BONES ABOUT IT. THE TOWN HAS GOTTEN CALLS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY THREATENING TO CANCEL SUMMER VACATIONS TO NEW HAMPSHIRE IN COPELAND WOULDN'T LEAVE AND THE TOWN FOUND ITSELF STUCK WITHOUT THE AUTHORITY TO FIRE OR REMOVE AN ELECTED OFFICIAL. I SAID MY PHONE IS RINGING OFF THE HOOK. I CAN'T SLEEP ANYMORE. MY STOMACH IS UPSET. I CAN'T TAKE THE PRESSURE AND EVERYBODY IS ON ME. SO THIS TOWN BEGINS TO MOVE FORWARD NOW AND IT ROLELY HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT FOR THE WOMAN WHO OVERHEARD THIS CONVERSATION A FEW WE WEEKS AGO.
