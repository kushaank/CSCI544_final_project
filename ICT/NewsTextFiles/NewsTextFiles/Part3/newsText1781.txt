
Yesterday, while I was enjoying relatively clear skies in Colorado, just one state north of me the weather was just a tad more dramatic. A group of stormchasers who call themselves Basehunters took a drive from Wright to Newcastle, in northeast Wyoming, and got seriously jaw-dropping footage of a supercell forming right in front of them.

Definitely make that HD and full screen.

Ye. GADS. That rotating mesocyclone (the rising, spinning vortex of air) is a monster, and made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Watching the footage of it forming and moving toward them, I was thinking “Get the hell out of there!” when suddenly you see the video jump as they drive away.

Phew.
