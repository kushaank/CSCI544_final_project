
Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d. returned to profit in the first quarter after Slovenia’s biggest bank received 2.17 billion euros ($3 billion) from the government in a bank industry repair that helped the country avoid a bailout.

NLB, as the bank is also known, reported a 28.6 million-euro net income in the period, compared with a 700,000 euro loss a year earlier, Chief Executive Office Janko Medja told reporters in Ljubljana today. The bank also transferred 2.2 billion euros of toxic loans to the bank asset-management company, or bad bank, and had a 1.44 billion-euro loss for 2013.

NLB may be put up for sale by the government, which spent 3.2 billion euros to clean up its lenders and avoided seeking outside assistance last year. Medja has said the sale may be completed by the end of next year following a state decision.

Slovenia is slated for early elections as soon as July because Premier Alenka Bratusek announced her resignation May 5 after she lost the leadership challenge for her party to Ljubljana Mayor Zoran Jankovic . The political crisis won’t affect the privatization process, central bank Vice Governor Stanislava Zadravec Caprirolo said in an interview last week.

NLB, along with Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor d.d. and SID banka d.d., are being reviewed again this year before the European Central Bank takes over the supervision of the largest banks in Europe . The Slovenian central bank doesn’t expect any big shocks from the ECB health check, Caprirolo has said.
