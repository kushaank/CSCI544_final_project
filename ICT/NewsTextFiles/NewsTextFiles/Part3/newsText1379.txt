
THE Ukraine crisis recalls 1914 before the outbreak of the First World War as Russia, the US and European governments risk "sleepwalking" into conflict, says former German chancellor Helmut Schmidt.

"I don’t want to encourage a third world war, and especially not calls for more money for arms for Nato (the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation)," Mr Schmidt, 95, was quoted as saying in an interview with Germany’s Bild newspaper. "But the danger that the situation intensifies, as in 1914, is growing day by day."

Mr Schmidt, who was chancellor from 1974 to 1982, and fellow Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, who held the post from 1998 to 2005, have warned against imposing sanctions on Russia and against moves by the European Union (EU) and Nato to forge closer ties with Ukraine.

The interventions by past chancellors highlight the dilemma in Germany over how to deal with Russia. Chancellor Angela Merkel, a Christian Democrat who grew up in communist East Germany and rules with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) as junior partner, has taken a harder line in threatening to intensify EU sanctions if Ukraine’s May 25 elections are disrupted.

Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier has stressed the diplomatic initiative, visiting Kiev and Odessa last week in a bid to broker talks between the government and separatists.

Some SPD members, including Mr Schroeder, favour greater engagement with Russia and hark back to SPD chancellor Willy Brandt’s Ostpolitik, which normalised Cold War ties with the East bloc starting with the Soviet Union.

A poll last week showed 70% of Germans have "no sympathy" for what Russian President Vladimir Putin is doing in Ukraine.

Mr Schroeder, who once labelled Mr Putin "a flawless democrat", was appointed chairman of Nord Stream, which built and operates a natural gas pipeline running from Russia to Germany, within three months of leaving office. He was criticised last month for celebrating his 70th birthday with Mr Putin in St Petersburg, a meeting Mr Schroeder said he used to lobby for Russian help to free Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe monitors taken captive in Ukraine. The monitors were subsequently released.

Mr Schmidt was born a month after the First World War ended in 1918. He served with the Wehrmacht in the Second World War on the eastern and western fronts and was taken prisoner by British forces in 1945. "Europe, the Americans and also Russia are behaving in the way that the author Christopher Clark, in his book (The Sleepwalkers: how Europe went to war in 1914) that’s very much worth reading, describes the start of World War I: like sleepwalkers," he says.

Jan Techau, head of the Brussels office of the Carnegie Endowment, disputes Mr Schmidt’s comparison with 1914. "We don’t have those kind of blind military alliances that drag countries into war," he says. "No country now calculates that war would be a good thing, as in 1914, and the US has made it clear to both Ukraine and Moldova it won’t get involved militarily. We are living in an age of nuclear deterrence, which means this can’t escalate like in 1914."

Mr Schmidt also says that the European Commission, the EU’s executive, has been wrong to seek closer ties with Ukraine and Georgia. "A reminder: Georgia is outside of Europe," he says. "This is megalomania, we have no business being there."

In a March 26 interview with Die Zeit newspaper, Mr Schmidt was quoted as saying that Russia’s actions in Crimea were "understandable" and the situation in Ukraine was "dangerous because the US and Europe are getting so terribly worked up".

Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March, and Ukrainian officials blame their powerful neighbour for fomenting the separatist movement that is roiling the country’s eastern regions.
