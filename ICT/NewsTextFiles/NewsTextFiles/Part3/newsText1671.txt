
Connecticut teenager Talia Maselli dodged a bullet last week, after Joe Biden regretfully informed her that he would not be able to attend the high school prom she asked the vice president to seven months ago.

She also warned that should he refuse, she would ask Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner as a back-up date. “And we can’t have that now can we,” she wrote.

Maselli wrote the letter back in October and never expected to receive a reply. So she was shocked (and a little skeptical) when she opened a handwritten letter containing a red, white and blue corsage last Thursday.

“I am flattered, but my schedule will not permit me to be in Connecticut on Friday evening,” Biden wrote. “But I hope you will accept this corsage and enjoy your prom as much as I did mine.” The vice president went on to invite the girl to visit the White House this summer.

Maselli — clearly too cool to tolerate “a high school dance” — didn’t make it to her prom last Friday. But she’s keeping the corsage fresh in her refrigerator and is gleefully awaiting her July visit with Uncle Joe.
