
Oversee its use for the development of the economy, the security of the nation, and the protection of private property, the keystone of capitalism.

I suspect it may come as a surprise to many people that the federal government owns just over a quarter of the nationâs landmass and, other than land set aside for military bases and naval ports that may seem excessive. It is.

In theory one can apply for a license or lease âto make productive use of this landâ noted Travis Kavulla in his article, â Public-Land Colonialism. â  In practice âThe National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 requires an excruciatingly complex process before even mundane land-use decisions can be made.â It is a regulatory nightmare for anyone who might want to create a mine to access coal or valuable minerals or extract oil or natural gas.

The Obama administration has been devoted to stopping all kinds of projects that might generate jobs and revenue from projects like the Pebble Mine. Its opposition to the building of the Keystone XL pipeline is the best known example, but the EPAâs âwar on coalâ has closed many mines in addition to coal-fired plants needed to provide electricity.

The EPA is requesting jurisdiction over all public and private streams in the nation and this has been called âthe largest land grab in the history of the world.â  So it is not just public lands that are affected, but private lands as well.

This is, simply stated, Communism in which the government owns all the land.

One of the BLMâs reasons cited for its actions against the Bundy ranch involved âendangered animalsâ and Rucker said, âTake away a personâs right to choose how to use their land and in effect youâve seized that land.â The attack on private land ownership is led by the United Nations Agenda 21.

There are federal laws that have been on the books a very long time that are intended to protect private property from the actions we have seen by the BLM and the EPA. One is the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, so this issue has been around awhile, but what is generally unknown is how vast federal control is.

America is under attack from within by federal government agencies that are striving to deny access to the greatest energy reserves in the world and to control the lives of ranchers and farmers whose work feed the rest of us.

It is time for the states to take back their land from the federal government and to oversee its use for the development of the economy, the security of the nation, and the protection of private property, the keystone of capitalism.
