
San Francisco's Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory school has issued an apology to a female student after excluding a photo of her wearing a tuxedo from the school's yearbook.

Jessica Urbina, a senior at Sacred Heart, posed for her yearbook photo wearing a tuxedo, but the photo was not included in the yearbook. The school had said Urbina's outfit was a violation of its dress code, which stated boys wear tuxedos in their yearbook photos, while girls wear dresses.

Urbina's classmates staged a protest last week by wearing bow ties to school and rallied for Urbina under the hashtag #JessicasTux on Twitter.

On Friday, Sacred Heart officials announced that the school would change its senior portrait policy. In a statement, school officials wrote, "We agree with our students who showed solidarity with their classmate that the current policy regarding senior portraits is not adequate to meet the needs of our families or our mission."

Officials also stated that Urbina's portrait will be included in the yearbook and displayed at the school's graduation ceremony along with the portraits of her classmates.

"As a school, we must better learn how to support our students who are navigating issues of gender identity," officials wrote. They also added that it was atypical for the school to release a statement about a student, but gained consent from the Urbina family prior to publication.
