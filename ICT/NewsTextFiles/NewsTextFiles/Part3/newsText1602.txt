
If Pfizer ’s bid for Astra Zeneca really has fallen through , law makers in Sweden won’t be shedding any tears.

They have been listing the reasons why the bid would be bad for Sweden for weeks even though the reality is that AstraZeneca isn’t quite as Swedish as sometimes it is is made out to be. Barely 12% of AstraZeneca’s 51,500 staff work in Sweden while three out of every four dollars of the company’s $26-billion in annual revenue are made outside Europe.

That was an unusual intervention in the affairs of a private company in this small open economy where lawmakers usually steer clear of expressing views on things like mergers and acquisitions.

The ministers’ qualms are threefold: jobs, research and tax income.

Of the 5,900 people AstraZeneca in Sweden, researchers make up an important component , equivalent to 25% of the company’s research team. Sweden still represents about 30% of AstraZeneca’s production and the company is the biggest single payer of Swedish corporate tax.

“Pfizer has a history of quickly and sharply cutting staff in the wake of acquisitions,” the three Swedish ministers said Friday.

AstraZeneca was itself the result of a 1999 merger between Swedish Astra AB and Zeneca Group PLC of the UK but that hasn’t been reflected in the way Pfizer has presented its takeover plans, according to Swedish Enterprise Minister Annie Lööf.

“It is worrying when you see a map from Pfizer which doesn’t even include Sweden,” Ms. Lööf told reporters here Friday.

Ultimately lawmakers here have few levers to pull to stop the deal.

The Swedish ministers haven’t proposed any legislation which could be used to ward off hostile takeover bids for Swedish companies or demanded Pfizer commit to keeping jobs or research in Sweden.

As some investors say that Pfizer has now made a fairly-priced offer, the political backing that AstraZeneca’s Swedish chairman Leif Johannson has got for his go-it-alone stance may not yet be enough to keep the pharmaceutical company independent.
