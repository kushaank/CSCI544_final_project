
Johannesburg - While striking platinum mineworkers starve, the leader of the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) is living in the lap of luxury, according to a report.

Amcu president Joseph Mathunjwa owns three BMWs worth about R900 000 as well as three houses, including a guest house, The Star said.

Mathunjwa’s wife is also the director of several businesses, the newspaper reports.

In April, the Amcu boss asked the public and government to open their pockets for the union’s striking members who have gone for months without pay.

"We opened a strike fund in pursuance of a living wage for our members... we want as much money as we can raise," Mathunjwa told reporters in Pretoria.

Julius Malema ’s Economic Freedom Fighters said last week that it would be donating R50 000 to the fund.

Amcu members went on a strike in January at Anglo Platinum (Amplats), Impala Platinum (Implats) and Lonmin, demanding a more than doubling of monthly wages to R12 500.
