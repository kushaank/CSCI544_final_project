Founded in Santa Cruz, California, just 14 years ago, Crossfit has taken New Zealand - and most of the world - by storm.

There are over 100 Crossfit workout facilities, or "boxes", around the country, including 42 in Auckland. Ben and Owen Franks, the rugby players, own five facilities .

Crossfitters can also compete in the "Crossfit Games", a global fitness competition. Last weekend several Kiwi teams traveled to compete at a regional in Wollongong, Australia.

While there's an enthusiastic community around Crossfit, and some devotees say it has gotten them in the shape of their lives, there's also been a backlash by those that say the sport is risky and can cause injuries. A New Plymouth physiotherapist last year warned she had treated patients with shoulder and back injuries acquired through Crossfit.
