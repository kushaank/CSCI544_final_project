
The Opposition today formally requested the Speaker of the House of Representatives to “take note of the lie in which Justice Minister Owen Bonnici was caught in during the meeting of the Public Accounts Committee last week”.

The committee, a PN statement said, was misled when Dr Bonnici objected to a request that the Henley and Partners contract is discussed.

On 14 May, Dr Bonnici objected to the Opposition’s request for a discussion on the contract for two reasons – that the contract had been presented in court and that the court had ruled that the contract is not made public. According to Dr Bonnici, Parliament cannot ignore the courts of law.

The Opposition said that it is not true that the government has submitted the contract signed with Henley and Partners in court. There is also no court ruling for the contract not to be published.

In light of this, the Opposition requested the Speaker to ensure that the PAC’s work is not hindered by twisting of facts.

I bet there will  be strong opposition from the Dr. Muscat and his government, and pressure will be used on the Speaker not to accept this valit request by Dr.S.Busuttil; and his team.
