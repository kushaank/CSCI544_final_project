Pfizer Rejected. British drug giant AstraZeneca has rejected what Pfizer says will be its final over to acquire the company at a $117 billion valuation, the FT reports.  "A top 10 shareholder said they were 'sick as a parrot' at the UK pharmaceutical company’s decision," the paper said. "AstraZeneca’s shares were down 12.8 per cent at £42.05 by mid morning in London."

AT&T Buying DirecTV. The telecom behemoth announced it'll purchase the satellite TV provider for an all-in total of $67 billion. It will now face regulatory scrutiny. Here's how, BI's Steve Kovach says , they intend to beat it: "AT&T will frame the DirecTV purchase as a way to provide blanket internet access to portions of the country that don't have reliable broadband yet. Meanwhile, AT&T will have to prove to the government that its proposed merger won't give it an unfair advantage over other TV and internet providers. However, AT&T could spin its own proposal as a counterweight to the Comcast deal."

Subprime Across The Pond. There's been a new surge in non-conforming loan sale packages in the U.K.'s white-hot property market, the FT reports . A senior London-based securitization banker told the paper: "Banks have had these loans on their balance sheets for a while and are seeking to take advantage while the market is more receptive to racier credits. Also, with regulators' stress tests coming up, these are the kind of assets you want to get rid of because they hurt you."
