
CLAIMS made by the Fiji Labour Party that the recent position of Fiji's permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva â€” awarded to Nazhat Shameem was not advertised, have been refuted by Foreign Affairs Minister Ratu Inoke Kubuabola.

Ratu Inoke yesterday said contrary to FLP claims that Ms Shameem was "hand-picked by the Prime Minister ahead of many senior career officials", the position was indeed advertised.

Fiji's mission in Geneva will be opened on June 2.
