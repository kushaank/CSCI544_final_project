
Google should not be forced to remove links to factually accurate articles, the prime minister’s spokesman has hinted.

David Cameron is concerned about a judgment granting people the right to demand that information about them is removed from search engines, Downing Street suggested.

His official spokesman said that Mr Cameron was still considering a ruling last week by a European court that enshrines the “right to be forgotten”, which has been called a “danger to free speech”.
