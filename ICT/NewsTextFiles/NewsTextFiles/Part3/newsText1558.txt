
North Korea has apologised to bereaved families after an apartment building collapsed in Pyongyang last week, the official KCNA news agency said, a rare admission of fallibility from the reclusive state. It is unknown how many died in the accident.

Pyongyang's expression of "profound consolation and apology" was the first official news of the disaster, which happened in the Phyongchon district of the North Korean capital on Tuesday.

The KCNA statement said the collapse of the apartment building "claimed casualties" but did not give any indication of how many may have been killed or injured. It said a rescue operation ended on Saturday.

An official from South Korea's unification ministry said yesterday that a 23-storey apartment building had collapsed in Pyongyang on Tuesday, but he would not say from where the information had been obtained.

The official, who asked not to be identified, said "hundreds" were presumed to be dead.

The KCNA statement said North Korean authorities put emergency measures into place to rescue people from the collapsed building and to treat the injured.

It said Choe Pu-il, North Korea's minister of people's security, had "repented", saying he had failed to supervise the project adequately, "thereby causing an unimaginable accident".
