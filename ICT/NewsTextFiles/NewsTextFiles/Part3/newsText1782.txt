
Republican candidate for Governor Bruce Rauner held a town hall event today at the Renaissance Chicago North Shore Hotel in Northbrook.

Rauner has been running a very organized and highly structured campaign. His message is tightly controlled and well thought out, not allowing for glaring mistakes that can derail a candidate.

Speaking before a North Shore audience of around 200 women, Rauner called for a shakeup in Springfield.

Rauner was joined by his wife, Diana, and his running mate, Evelyn Sanguinetti.

As he spoke to a 99 percent white audience he was asked, based on that narrow demographic, if his campaign is geared to all of Illinois.

Rauner stuck to his agenda of criticizing lawmakers in Springfield, saying they are keeping Illinois at the bottom of the ladder for productivity.

He continues to push his platform of more jobs, more higher education for students, and term limits in Springfield.

If any people have a brain cell left ,they would be wise to give this man their vote and stop the madness from all the career politicians who follow the bouncing ball straight to the end of our State from Agenda 21.

Do You think anyone has brain cells in Chicago? They elected Quinn and all those crooked career politicians. They are programmed voters They cannot tell who is wasting our money. It will take a miracle for Illinois to come back to prosperity. We are too deep in the hole.
