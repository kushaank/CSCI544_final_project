Besides discourses and lectures on Indian culture, there will be special programmes like yoga training and training classes on communication skills.

Mr. Srikanth lauded the efforts of the TTD and the Dharma Prachara Parishad for coming out with an effective programme for creating the much needed awareness among the youth in cultural aspects. TTD senior officer B. Rami Reddyoutlined the objectives of the event and he called upon the young participants to make good advantage of their training classes in the present ‘subhapradam’ camp.

Several vedic scholars, TTD pundits and others also spoke on the occasion.

The organisers lined up various facilities for residential accommodation of the students who were attending the 7-day camp. They were also being provided transport and boarding facilities in this respect.

As there was good response from the youth, the TTD was planning to further include some more useful activities in the ‘subhapradam’ programmes so as to make them youth-friendly with wider reach.
