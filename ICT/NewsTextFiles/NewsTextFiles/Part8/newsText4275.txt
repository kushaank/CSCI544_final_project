GEM partners with employers to provide fellows summer internships, which are an integral part of the GEM Fellowship program. Barberan was surprised when he learned that MIT Lincoln Laboratory had selected him.

While Barberan isn’t exactly sure what he will do after he completes his doctoral program in five or six years, he does want to continue research.

While at NMSU, Barberan did several outreach visits to area schools, talking about the University Nanosat Program, or science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), in general. He even created an app for the University Nanosat Program, called NMSU University NanoSat Program, which will be available in the iTunes store this month.

Barberan, the first college graduate in his family, encourages other students who hope for funded graduate programs to get involved early to spend lots of time focusing on solid internships and community outreach projects.

“CJ is an excellent role model for many of our native New Mexican students in his pursuit of a higher education. I'm sad to see him go, but am excited to see his future contributions to image processing and machine learning,” Boucheron said.
