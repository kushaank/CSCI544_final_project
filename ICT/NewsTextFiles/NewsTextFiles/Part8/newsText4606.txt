Whitmore Lake seniors returned to land for their 2014 prom with a chic "Night in Paris"-themed prom at Barton Hills Country Club. Students Amanda Stevens and Cody Hennings teamed up to capture these images of the evening.

Amanda Stevens is a junior at Whitmore Lake High School. She has been a dancer for more than 14 years and plans to continue her pursuit of the art into college. She also enjoys attending concerts for different types of musical genres as well as participating in events like comic con with friends. She intends on pursing photojournalism and therapy for children with emotional disorders as career options in college.

Photography is just one of many artistic pursuits for Whitmore Lake High School junior Cody Hennings. Skateboarding, acting, playing in his indie rock band and graphic design all compete for his time outside of the classroom and plans to mirror many of those creative interests in his long-term education and career path.
