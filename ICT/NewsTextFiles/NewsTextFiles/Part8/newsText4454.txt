
Given these new findings, study's lead author Dr. Michael Eisenberg, assistant professor of urology and Stanford University School of Medicine's director of male reproductive medicine and surgery, said health care professionals who treat men for infertility should encourage their patients to adopt a healthier lifestyle that might help them lengthen their life spans.

"There may be a window of opportunity here. When they see their doctor they could do some other things that might benefit them," Eisenberg said to WeBMD . "I see this as an opportunity to pay more attention to your health and be more proactive."

Eisenberg and his team reviewed the medical records of about 12,000 men aged between 20 and 50 who had gone to Stanford University School of Medicine or the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston to be assessed for potential infertility.

The researchers compared patients' semen quality to death records to learn the men's death rates, while considering any health issues that could affect the subjects' semen quality.

The study discovered that no single semen defect in itself predicted early death, but men with two or more semen abnormalities (i.e. low semen volume, sperm concentration, sperm activity, and total sperm count) had higher risk of death than their healthy counterparts.

"This striking increased death rate in men with abnormal semen parameters highlights the urgency and need to investigate the causes of male infertility and not to just proceed with assisted reproductive technologies," said Dr. Natan Bar-Chama, director of male reproductive medicine and surgery at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, to WeBMD.
