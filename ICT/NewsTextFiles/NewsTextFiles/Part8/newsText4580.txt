“It’s an opportunity that we’ll really never have again,” said Taylor Ruby, a WKU sophomore from Somerset.

This year’s group has a goal of $100,000, which it will donate to the BrightFocus Foundation, a nonprofit that supports research and provides public education to eradicate brain and eye diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease.

The group left this morning for Oceanside, Calif., where they’ll begin the ride Saturday. During the next two months, they’ll ride nearly 3,000 miles, averaging about 80 miles a day and ending in Washington, D.C., in mid-July.

Along the way, they’ll take rest days about once a week to host fundraising and awareness events.

They will pass through Kentucky in late June, and an event is scheduled in Bowling Green for June 29.

But between classes and organizing the route and stops along the way, the group hasn’t had as much time to train as they’d like. Still, they think the scope of their journey will hit them once they begin.
