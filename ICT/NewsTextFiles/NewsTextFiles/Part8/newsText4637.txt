
French-based GreenRent Electric Car Rental has joined forces with Nice Properties Real Estate Group. This partnership has launched MyGreenCity, a campaign that promotes clean energy initiatives in the city of Nice, France.

Launching in Nice in 2010, GreenRent is known for its electric-fueled Renault Twizy rental vehicles. Clients of Nice Properties will now benefit from an additional 10% discount on their car rentals, says GreenRent.

"We are so pleased with our new partnership with GreenRent,” said Michael Fusaro, CEO of Nice Properties. “In the last few years, Nice has been taking great measures to improve the city's sustainable infrastructure, so this was just the perfect opportunity for us to support Nice in its move towards becoming an eco-friendly city."
