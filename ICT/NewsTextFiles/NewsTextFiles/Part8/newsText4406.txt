
A: The death benefit in question, a maximum of $2,500, is paid to those who cover the funeral expenses, or to the heirs, of someone who contributed to the Quebec Pension Plan/Canada Pension Plan during their lifetime. (Priority is given to a person or organization who paid the funeral expenses if they submit an application and proof of payment within 60 days of the death). Unfortunately, the QPP death benefit is taxable. âGovernmental authorities are basically treating the death benefit like any other amount received from QPP/CPP and not like an insurance payment,â said notary FranÃ§ois Bernier of Mackenzie Investments. If you received this amount and you are a beneficiary of the deceased personâs estate, you can choose to include it on your own tax returns (line 114 federally, line 154 provincially) or on the Trust income tax returns of the estate, regardless of who the cheque is made out to. Including the amount on the trust return âwould allow you to lower the tax bill if your personal tax rate is high, and the income generated by the estate is low,â Bernier noted. Incidentally, applications for the QPP benefit can be made as late as five years after the death if it was somehow overlooked in the immediate aftermath.

A: If the timeshares were primarily or exclusively for personal use by the owner or related persons, the loss is not deductible. If theyâve been rented to others and you have been reporting income from them since 1989, it might be.

A: Thatâs your call to make with the financial institution that administers it. RESPs normally consist of a taxable portion (the grants and income) and an untaxed amount (the contributions). If the student/beneficiary has little or no other income in that year, itâs usually best to withdraw from the taxable amount (which belongs to the student and gets declared by them). Withdrawing the contributions has no tax consequences.
