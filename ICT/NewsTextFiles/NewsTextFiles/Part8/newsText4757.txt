
Standard Chartered has stepped outside the banking sector for its new finance director, luring Andy Halford, Vodafone’s former beancounter in chief, with a £2.8 million “golden hello”.

Mr Halford will join Standard Chartered in June 16 after leaving the British telecoms giant in March. Mr Halford, who is also a non-executive director at Marks & Spencer, is being handed up to £2.8 million in shares to replace the bonus scheme he had been awarded at Vodafone but was required to forfeit upon taking a new job.

The payout will be dependent on his performance at Standard Chartered over three years.
