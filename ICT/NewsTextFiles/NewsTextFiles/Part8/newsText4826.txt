
The National Media Commission (NMC), has condemned the publication of a picture showing the mortal remains of the late P.V. Obeng in the Daily Guide of May 19, 2014 and circulating on social media.

A statement issued by the chairman, of NMC, Mr Kabral Blay-Amihere and copied to Ghana News Agency in Accra, reminded members of the media that Article 7 (2) of the NMC’s Print Media Guidelines on grief states that “in cases involving bereavement, personal grief or shock, the press must show compassion. Publication must be handled sensitively at such times”.

The NMC stated that there is no public interest justification for the publication of the picture which contravenes Article 12 of the Ghana Journalists’ Association Code of Ethics, and violates Article 16 which states that “in cases of personal grief, distress, journalists should exercise tact and diplomacy in seeking information and publishing”.
