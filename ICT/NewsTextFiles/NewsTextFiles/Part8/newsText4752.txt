
The landlord arrested on suspicion of murdering Joanna Yeates has been released from police bail.

Ex-public school teacher Chris Jefferies, 66, was quizzed for several days over the murder of his neighbour in Bristol.

A spokesman said: "Avon and Somerset Police can confirm that a 66-year-old arrested on suspicion of murdering Joanna Yeates was released without charge on Friday 4 March."

Mr Jefferies was arrested on December 30 last year - after the frozen body of the landscape architect was discovered on Christmas Day.

Mr Jefferies, whose flat was in the same block on Canynge Road as Miss Yeates and boyfriend Greg Reardon's, was held for three days as detectives investigated.

He was released on New Year's Day after three days in custody.

Three weeks later Dutch engineer Vincent Tabak was charged with the 25-year-old's murder.

Tabak, who has been remanded to custody, lived next door to Miss Yeates in Clifton with his girlfriend, Tanja Morson, an analyst for Dyson.

Miss Yeates vanished on December 17. Two days later Mr Reardon reported her missing after returning home from a weekend visiting relatives in Sheffield.

On Christmas Day a couple walking their dogs in the Failand area, three miles from where Miss Yeates went missing, found a body. It was later confirmed to be Miss Yeates, who had been strangled.
