
WITH Election Day looming, Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Helen Zille gave a short interview to the News24 website on April 24 to talk about her party’s prospects.

Zille: Yeah, there were various media reports but we’ve never said that publicly as an external aim of the party.

Zille’s response on the 30% question is a lie, and a fairly blatant one at that. For anyone interested in the raft of evidence that reveals it to be this, this column sets it all out . It includes, among many other examples, a link to an SABC video clip of former DA parliamentary leader Lindiwe Mazibuko telling an audience in September 2013: "We want to win 30% of the vote nationally, 30% of the vote!"

So far as the scale of the lie goes, it’s not that big — but it’s not that small either. Zille’s attempts to do public damage control on the party’s initial 30% target was important because had she not the party’s final election outcomes — 22% — would have been gauged against that, internally and externally, and by that measure it was a fairly dismal showing. There would have consequences for Zille had the party stuck stridently to it.

But the scale is not really what is interesting about the lie. Rather, the way in which it was arrived at, and what it says about Zille’s personality and her relationship with the truth on this particular issue.

Publicly Zille places much emphasis on her honesty. She tweets often about how she is a truth teller and never lies, and contrasts herself to the African National Congress (ANC). On May 1, for example, she tweeted: "So ANC clearly lied to prevent Cyril Ramaphosa from debating me." When a response suggested she lied, she said: "Name one lie. Just one." Well, here is one for her to chew on. That said, she no doubt believes what she says. And that is the interesting thing about Zille.

How did it come to this? How did she come to believe, with regards to the 30% claim, black was white? In order to better understand, here are the five stages the 30% lie referred to above passed through.

Aside from the broader party structures, Zille herself was often reported as publicly advocating, explaining and promoting a 30% target in the years running up to the election. A July 2012 Financial Mail story wrote: "The DA holds about 24% of the vote nationally, which party leader Helen Zille says she wants to increase to at least 30% after the next general election in two years".

In June 2013 Zille spoke to the DA’s London branch about the 30% target, which was reported on Twitter. Further, an August 2013 story from a local Eastern Cape newspaper reported on a DA fundraiser open to the public. In part the story read: "Zille spoke passionately on the party’s goal to bring the ANC under 50% in Gauteng and to gain 30% of the vote nationally." She was quoted as saying "I know this is a stretch target but we are determined to build a new majority".

This then was the initial truth — the 30% target might well have started as an internal goal but on various different platforms and over a number of years it was expressed by numerous party leaders, including Zille herself, as an external goal.

It appears that at some point Zille realised 30% was unachievable and, if the party carried on telling all and sundry it was the goal, it would cause the party no end of problems.

The DA's federal council minutes show she told the council on October 19 2013 to stop talking publicly about the 30% target. She said if the party managed 25% that would be an incredible achievement. Externally, she would start to shift expectations too, telling the Institute of Race Relations at a briefing titled "What you should expect from the Democratic Alliance in 2014" that same month: "It is misleading to compare local government elections with national elections. 2014 is a national/provincial election and we must compare our targets against the benchmark set in the 2009 national/provincial general election, when the DA won 16.6% of the vote".

By this time, however, the 30% figure was pervasive in the media. That is what happens when you trumpet a goal on national television. That fact would have to be dealt with. And so it was, on February 20 2014, Zille would tweet in response to then-Business Day editor Peter Bruce, who had speculated about the 30% target in his column: "Just to make it very clear: our target is NOT 30% of the vote." She followed that up by tweeting the party was now making "no predictions" on the grounds that "campaigns change things".

There you have the first public U-turn. At this stage the truth has not yet become a lie. However, you will notice there is no explanation offered for previous positions and the absolutely fundamental and brutal way in which the new reality is stated is fairly intimidating (note the capital letters). You will notice too how Bruce’s first instinct was to question his own position, not Zille’s — such was the force with which her contrary view was presented.

This next stage is the most interesting, slowly black turns into white, passing through several shades of grey on the way. It is important to understand, however, that this stage would not exist at all if someone did not contest stage three, which would be Zille’s ideal. Hence the new reality is stated with such force. The desire is, through sheer force of will, to deny any other reality ever existed.

In a subsequent interview with the Business Day, and her about turn having been contrasted with the DA’s actual comments on the public record, Zille would start to fudge with parameters. She would only say of the 30% target that it was only meant to have been an ambition rather than an accurate estimate of support and that she had asked members to stop using it. "So it was never set as a fixed goal," she said. The suggestion now was that it was only ever an internal one, never an external one.

What Zille found was some ambiguous fact inherent to subject at hand (the fact that it was first an internal goal, which was true, although it later became an external one) and then project it onto what has happened, making it define the entire idea and building a compelling narrative around it. She admits some fault but has established a new narrative — an internal goal that was, once or twice, mistakenly said publicly.

After a small passage of time, it appears Zille has now completely internalised her new narrative. As she said in the News24 interview: "We’ve never said that publicly as an external aim of the party." She has post rationalised the new narrative in her own head to such an extent she believes the whole thing never took place. There simply was no 30% target ever publicly expressed by the party. It never happened. And so a new truth is born.

Here too it is said with great force and conviction. The interview clumsily abandons the line of questioning altogether, stopped dead in her tracks by Zille.

Those are the five stages.

There is possibly a sixth stage. In the News24 interview, you can see the beginnings of a conspiracy against her. She doesn’t explicitly blame the media but she clearly intimates there were reports that were obviously false because, as she says, what they claimed never happened. Any discrepancy between the new reality she has inculcated and objective reality must be explained and what is better — and easier — than blaming a devious media who invented the whole thing up.

Aiding Zille along the way in establishing a new reality is a mastery of words and argument. She can use language very powerfully and effectively to reorder events and statements into a new truth and, if you had to engage with her at one particular stage, you would no doubt be convinced — such is the force with which she argues. But it simply isn’t true. In this instance, this makes her a great politician but no bastion of honesty.

The passage of time helps too, as people forget.

It is a remarkable trait Zille has developed, and it is fundamentally held too. Present her with the News24 interview and she will die in the ditch to make the case that she only tells the truth. She believes it. In her mind, and on this particular case, she did tell the truth. She has talked herself into a new reality and will be completely dumbfounded when it jars with a more objective description of events.

On that note, I am taking a break. I will be back on BDlive in full force in August. Until then!
