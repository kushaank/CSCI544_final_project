
The legal team of actor-TV host Vhong Navarro is confident that the case of serious illegal detention in relation with the mauling incident that happened in a condominium unit last Jan. 22 involving Deniece Cornejo, Cedric Lee, Zimmer Raz, JP Calma, Bernice Lee, Ferdinand Guerrero and Edgardo Sampana will push through until Feb. 24, 2015. In an interview with Julius Babao, Karen Davila and Ces Orena-Drilon, hosts of the late night news program Bandila this morning, May 19, 2014 (U.S. time) Atty. Alma Mallonga said Vhong’s revelation is enough for the team to win the battle.

Several weeks ago, a report regarding the controversial meeting of Jed Fernandez with Tony Calvento and Department of Justice Sec. Leila De Lima, circulated online, according to the report , Jed wanted to become a state witness. Sadly, after a heart to heart talk with the secretary, Jed backed out and decided to hide instead of using the opportunity to clear and remove his name from the list of the accused.

Aside from Jed, speculations also came out that Deniece Cornejo was planning to testify against Cedric Lee and the others involved in the incident, but the TV and print ad model immediately dismissed the issue when she decided to come out and surrendered herself to PNP Chief Alan Purisima. Until today, the issue is still one of the hottest topics online, but according to Atty. Alma Mallonga, during her interview with Julius Babao on "Bandila," the court has the sole authority to approve and discuss the issue if the accused will be given the chance to testify or not.

The lawyer almost said that some of the requirements to become a state witness are not applicable to Deniece Cornejo. Incidentally, Deniece’s filed rape complaint against Vhong Navarro has been dismissed by the Department of Justice due to lack of evidence, but despite the dismissal of the case, her camp still believes that she was raped by Vhong Navarro on the evening of Jan. 17 and 22, 2014.
