
Coronation Street star Kym Marsh heads to her new role - just for the next few days - on Manchester radio station Key 103.

Corrie star Kym headed to the Castlefield studios of the station on Monday morning to join up with breakfast show host Mike Toolan while co-host Chelsea Norris is on holidays.

Kym, who plays Corrie barmaid Michelle Connor, wore a white t-shirt and pale blue jeans for her DJ stint.

The t-shirt was emblazoned with the words 'Baby Don't Cry', a nod to the 1992 INXS track.

Lyrics from the rest of the song and pictures of the band are also featured on the white and black top.
