
The project includes programmes on e-health, e-education and e-justice, with a number of pilots already underway.

Ghana’s minister of communications Dr Edward Omane Boamah, speaking at the World Telecommunication and Information Society Day in Accra, said more sectors of Ghana’s economy should also be ICT-driven, including oil and gas, transportation, commerce, manufacturing and leisure.

He said the Ministry of Communications is complementing the country’s Judicial Service by integrating ICT, video and mobile technologies, which he said would improve productivity and efficiency of court dispositions.

Boamah also said Ghana’s Legislative Assembly is set to implement an e-parliamentary system.

“Under the e-parliament system, members of parliament will be able to file their queries online, leading to speedy and paperless flow of information,” he said.
