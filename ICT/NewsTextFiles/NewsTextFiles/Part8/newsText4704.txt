Longitude Prize offers £10 million for a solution to a major scientific problem.

The Longitude Prize is offering £10 million (about $17 million) to anyone who can come up with a solution to a major scientific problem facing mankind. The competition was inspired by the 1714 Longitude Prize offered by the British government to the person who could figure out a way to precisely pinpoint a ship’s position at sea. It was not until 1764 that John Harrison first won the prize for his chronometer.

At last year’s G8 summit, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced a new incarnation of the Longitude Prize in an effort to spark serious interest in solving one of six global challenges. Six potential challenges were announced today at the BBC’s Broadcasting House. The final challenge will be decided by a public vote taken Thursday after a special 50th anniversary edition of the BBC science television series Horizon.
