
LAREDO, TEXAS (KGNS) -- A new campus for a local charter school continues its progress to open before the end of the year.

A few months back, the City of Laredo signed a lease with Harmony Public Schools, the owner of Harmony Science Academy here in Laredo.

It's a new elementary school in the Harmony Private System that's being considered by city council tonight for a rent abatement.

The school worked out a lease with the city a few months back, but it's come back to the table saying it's planning some major improvements to that property.

The council is considering a new rent abatement, totaling up to half a million dollars for the school over the next five years.

That's after the school indicated it'll spend more than $3 million to improve the property.

The building is located in the Laredo Airport area, managed by Jose Flores, who says he's happy some of that extra airport property is getting used.

The new contract up for consideration before the council sets the rent with the school for 31 years.

Flores says the school will spruce up the area, adding landscaping and sidewalks.

And that, he says will increase the appeal and property value of the rest of the area.

The school is moving forward on its earlier goal set this year to open by the fall school semester.
