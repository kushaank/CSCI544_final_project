
LONDON - A book on the missing Malaysian plane suggests that the aircraft was shot down during a military exercise .

Author Nigel Cawthorne has penned Flight MH-370 - the Mystery .

The book details how a man, working on an oil rig in the Gulf of Thailand,Â  claims to have seen a burning plane on the same day the Malysian Airlines flight went missing.

Cawthorne links the alleged sighting to joint US-Thai exercises in the region at the time.

He claims the information released was incorrect, so that the search would be concentrated in the wrong area.

Several countries have been searching for the plane in the Indian Ocean.

Flight MH-370 disappeared on 8 March.

The book went on sale in Australia on Monday, just 71 days after the plane vanished.
