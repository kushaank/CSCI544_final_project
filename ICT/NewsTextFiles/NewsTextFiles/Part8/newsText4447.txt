18-year old Jacqueline Gomez, a high school senior, was found dead in one of the beds at the Hyatt Friday night. Police say they found alcohol, and prescription pain killers in the room.

They're questioning Gomezâ€™s boyfriend who was in the room and called 9-1-1 to report that she had stopped breathing. Police are waiting for autopsy results, but they say there were no signs of trauma, and the boyfriend is cooperating.
