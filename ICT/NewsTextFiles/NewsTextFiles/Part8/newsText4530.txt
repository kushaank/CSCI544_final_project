That came ahead of the May 25th Presidential elections in Ukraine which, if hindered or impeded by violence, could trigger so-called ‘Stage-3′ sanctions, co-ordinated with the US, Barclays Research explained to clients on Friday.

So-called Stage-3 sanctions, as set out by the European Council on March 20th, would comprise unspecified ‘far-reaching consequences for relations on a broad range of economic areas’.

They could push Russia into a severe recession and lead to retaliatory moves, perhaps by means of a reduction in its energy exports to Europe, Barclays added.

An officer from NATO told The Wall Street Journal that the alliance had seen no significant change in Russian troop deployments on the border.
