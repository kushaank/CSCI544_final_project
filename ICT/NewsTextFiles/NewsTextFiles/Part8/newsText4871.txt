
Mary Miller, the U.S. Treasury Department’s undersecretary for domestic finance, said regulators could eventually decide against naming any asset managers systemically important.

The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of regulators led by Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, is holding a public conference today on the asset management industry.

Miller and executives from BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest money manager, and bond firm Pacific Investment Management Co. will speak during the sessions at the Treasury Department in Washington . Billionaire Ken Griffin, chief executive officer of hedge fund Citadel Advisors LLC, also will participate.

The council, or FSOC, can designate non-bank companies systemically important and subject them to Federal Reserve oversight. The FSOC began discussing BlackRock and Fidelity Investments in October, people familiar with the matter said at the time.

The companies had triggered numerical criteria set by the council that automatically place them in the second stage of a three-step process. Meeting those thresholds doesn’t mean the firms will ever be designated, and any decision could be months away.
