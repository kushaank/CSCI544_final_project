So far, there are no reports of any injuries. The cause of the fire is not yet known. Photographs taken by eyewitnesses showed black smoke emerging from the market on Chalk Farm Road.

Fire Borough Commander Richard Welch said: "When firefighters arrived they were faced with a fire in a range of shops under railway arches and the smoke could be seen from miles around."

Police and London Fire Brigade (LFB) were called to the scene at about 8pm, deploying six fire engines and 30 firefighters to deal with the blaze.

The fire brigade tweeted: "The fire at Stables Market on Chalk Farm Road can be seen from miles around. We were called just before 8pm #Camden."

A spokeswoman for the London Ambulance Service (LAS) said paramedics were called to the incident shortly after but no injuries had been reported.

Located in the historic former Pickfords stables, the market is a popular tourist attraction in London visited by more than 40 million people, according to its website, and is known for its food, jewellery and clothing stalls.
