
Margo Davidson won in historic fashion in 2010 when she became the first African-American, female and Democrat to be elected as state representative in the 164th Legislative District.

Nearly four years later, a pair of challengers � Billy Smith and Dafan Zhang � are seeking to pull off their own historic victory in Tuesday�s Democratic primary.

An incumbent state legislator representing Delaware County has not fallen in a primary in decades. The candidates� spending habits indicate that could change.

Smith has spent $68,727 in his bid to unseat Davidson and advance to face Republican Saud Siddiqui in the general election. Davidson has spent $49,493 to protect her seat. Both have stuffed the mailboxes of voters with campaign literature that has turned negative as the election draws near.

Zhang avoided fundraising and endorsements, saying he did not want to be bound to special interest groups. Instead, he ran a minimalist campaign centered around his personal American Dream story.

Davidson, of Upper Darby, is seeking her third term in Harrisburg. She won the endorsement of the Delaware County Democratic Party in February, though committee members nearly voted to hold an open primary.

Since then, much of the campaign narrative has revolved around education issues. Both the Upper Darby and William Penn school districts were among those most heavily impacted when the state education budget was reduced by $1 billion in 2011. Each district cut more than 45 positions.

The candidates each have called for enhanced education funding. They also agree that implementing an extraction tax on Marcellus Shale gas companies is one way to raise the needed revenue.

Davidson also has touted the additional $2.7 million she helped secure for Upper Darby in 2012, when its storied arts program nearly was eliminated. State Rep. Nicholas Micozzie, R-163, of Upper Darby, and state Sen. Edwin �Ted� Erickson, R-26, of Newtown also had a hand in obtaining the extra money.

Zhang said schools need to be fully-funded, but also must allocate their resources more effectively. He said schools must be driven by outcomes, not test evaluations.

Unlike her opponents, Davidson also advocates for school choice. She accepted $16,000 during the pre-primary campaign cycle from special interests groups supporting school choice.

Charter reform efforts are necessary, Davidson said, but parents deserve an opportunity to seek the best possible education for their child. She said charter schools will become less popular once traditional public schools improve.

Smith, who received $40,000 from the Pennsylvania State Education Association, acknowledged charter schools are here to stay, but need reform. He is heavily opposed to vouchers, which Davidson supports.

Zhang is opposed to both charters and vouchers. Charters divert funding from traditional public schools, Zhang said, leaving both schools with less resources.

Among other issues, Davidson has supported legislation to eliminate school property taxes in favor of increased state income and sales taxes. She also has co-sponsored legislation strengthening the penalties within the state�s Equal Pay Law and increasing the state�s minimum wage.

She said she also seeks to bring jobs to the community, citing her role in five development projects, including the construction of a hotel in the former Sears building on 69th Street and the revitalization of Long Lane.

Smith has focused much of his campaign on abortion issues, arguing the district needs a candidate that consistently will vote to protect a woman�s right to an abortion.

He has criticized Davidson � who identifies herself as pro-choice � for various abortion votes, including one requiring abortion clinics to meet the same safety regulations as freestanding, ambulatory surgical care facilities. Davidson said the law makes abortion clinics safer; Smith said it led to the closure of several women�s centers, limiting access to abortions and other services.

�It is a measure ripped straight out of the Tea Party textbook in Texas to circumvent, to go around, Roe vs. Wade, which is the law of the land,� Smith said.

Zhang, who also identifies as pro-choice, wants to enhance the voice of immigrants by creating a community relations commission, increase the local economy through joint marketing efforts and build the tax base by attracting young professionals who can commute to their Philadelphia jobs via the subway.

He also supports mixing market-rate and affordable housing. Affordable housing communities can be costly to maintain and create negative connotations for its residents. Mixed housing creates the same norms and standard for all residents, Zhang said.

Davidson, 51, holds endorsements from Teamsters Local 830, United Steelworkers Local 10-1, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1776 and the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO, among others. She has been heavily financed by Students First, a political action committee supporting school choice, and seven House Democrats, including several caucus leaders.

Prior to serving in Harrisburg, Davidson founded a marketing and advertising company and a pair of nonprofit organizations. A former journalist, she also worked as an organizer for Barack Obama�s 2008 presidential campaign.

Davidson holds a bachelor�s degree from Temple University. She is married and has four children.

Smith, 39, holds endorsements from the PSEA, Planned Parenthood, the National Organization for Women and Keystone Progress, among others. He received a bulk of his funding from the PSEA and various lawyers and legal offices.

Smith, a public defender, previously worked as an assistant district attorney in Philadelphia and served on Lansdowne Borough Council.

He earned his law degree from the University of New Hampshire and a bachelor�s degree from Temple University.

Smith, of Lansdowne, is married and has two children.

Zhang, 37, largely avoided the endorsement and campaign finance process, saying he did not want to owe favors to anyone but the voters.

A Chinese immigrant, Zhang once was homeless but overcame various obstacles along the path to becoming an adjunct professor at Delaware County Community College. He is building a startup, having previously owned a pair of small businesses in Upper Darby.

He graduated last week from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. He also holds a masters from Penn and a bachelor�s degree from West Chester University.

Zhang, of East Lansdowne, is married and has three children.
