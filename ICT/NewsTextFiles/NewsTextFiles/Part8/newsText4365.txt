
With six weeks remaining in the fiscal year, Superintendent James Hayden believes the Norwood Public Schools can finish the year in the black.

At an emergency School Committee meeting held on May 12, Hayden told members the School Department was on track to end the year with a $12,000 surplus rather than a deficit.

"We�ve revised and looked at all of our projections," Hayden said. "As of Thursday (May 8), we had been able to balance the budget and not end up in the negative."

However, this projection requires action from Town Meeting. The Norwood School Committee has four warrant articles on the Special Town Meeting warrant. The first two articles ask Town Meeting to transfer unexpended funds from prior fiscal years and surplus funds from the town�s fiscal 2014 interest and debt budget into the fiscal 2014 school operating budget. The third asks for $37,500 to cover the costs of a special education legal judgment.

"If Town Meeting votes to help us with that Special Education legal settlement, that $37,500 would be applied against that (deficit) and we�d end up in the positive," Hayden said.

Because of this, the School Committee withdrew its fourth article, a placeholder article meant to ask for an undetermined amount of funds to cover unanticipated fiscal 2014 costs.

If Town Meeting does not approve this $37,500 expense, the school department has a backup plan. They would work with the Selectman and Finance Commission to cover that expense through a Municipal Relief Act transfer.

"I�m lighting candles and hoping, but we have backup plans," Hayden said. "We�re not expecting this will be an issue. They�re with us on this. The Selectman, Finance Commission and town accountant are clearly with us on this."

The Finance Commission said just that at its May 12 meeting. They unanimously voted to recommend indefinite postponement of the school department�s placeholder article.

"It looks like they will be OK as we head into the last six weeks of the fiscal year," Finance Commission member Tom Maloney said, adding that if they aren�t, the Finance Commission is willing to schedule a meeting prior to the end of the fiscal year to accommodate the school department.

Finance Commission members spoke in hopeful terms about the Committee of 21 that is tasked with studying the school department�s budget. This committee, which features representatives from the School Committee, Selectmen, Finance Commission and Town Meeting, is tasked with hiring an independent expert to study the school budget, interpret this study and made a recommendation based on it.

"Long term, we�re going right back into the soup unless we fix this," Finance Commission member Joseph Greeley said.

Finance Commission member Alan Slater added that hopefully, the Committee of 21 will make a difference and provide the town with recommendations to address the school department�s budget.
