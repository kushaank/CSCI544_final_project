
Actress Song Hye-kyo appeared at the Cannes Film Festival to promote "The Crossing" last week. Director John Woo and actors Takeshi Kaneshiro and Zhang Ziyi also attended the press event.

As a non-Chinese, Song said she sometimes felt awkward and found it difficult to adapt to the new environment while shooting the film.

"Thanks to the friendliness of the actors and staff I gradually relaxed and was able to focus on my acting," Song added.

Set in China in the 1930s, "The Crossing" is based on the sinking of a steamer in 1949 that claimed the lives of over 1,500 passengers and crew.

The long-awaited film has drawn much attention due to its star-studded cast including top actors from Korea, China and Japan like Huang Xiaoming and Masami Nagasawa.

Since years after the production plan was first announced, the film will finally be released in China in November.
