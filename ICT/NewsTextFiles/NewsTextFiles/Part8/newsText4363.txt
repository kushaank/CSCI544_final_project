The change will be effective for KG1 schools from September 2014 while those schools starting in April, will implement the new ruling for academic year 2015/2016.

Currently, the minimum age for kids to be enrolled in kindergarten is three years. But the new move, according to the Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA), will provide uniformity and standardization in education and at least relatively equal opportunities for children in all private and public schools. The new admission policy will affect all KG1 schools in the academic year 2014/2015, and schools starting in September will be the first to introduce the new rules.

Kids going to Indian curriculum schools that start in April, will need to be 4-years-old for the 2015/2016 term. The cut-off age date has moved to December 31, while for schools starting in April, it has been changed to July 31. Another highlight of the statement is that all children must be enrolled in school by the age of six, which is equivalent of Grade 1 or Year 2.

Earlier, students were allowed to join school if they were three years old by April in the admission year. Now, they will have more time to play and to spend in pre-school, where they can learn basic things in a more informal, fun setting and prepare for school.

All educational institutions were informed on the changes by the KHDA. In fact, the authority said that a circular has been sent by the UAE Ministry of Education in December 2013. But some schools are still admitting children based on the old criteria. In September, all institutions need to follow the new rules.
