
Mayor Patricia de Lille has been accused of nepotism and doing exactly what the DA often accuses the ANC of.

Sources in the city council said at the weekend the changes in the mayoral committee were not balanced and fair “as some of the people ejected were not supposed to be”.

De Lille was also accused of employing people close to her in various positions in the council. “What is happening is centralisation. Patricia is centralising power. The centralisation, nepotism and cronyism taking place is unbelievable,” one source said.

“They are doing exactly what they criticise the ANC for.” But De Lille, through her chief of staff Paul Boughey shot back and denied the allegations.

“The appointments were made fully in line with the DA systems and procedures. “The mayor consulted with the deputy mayor (Ian Neilson) and the speaker (Dirk Smit) on the recommended list that would be presented to the DA’s federal executive committee for approval,” Boughey said.

The federal executive approved the recommended people at its meeting on Friday.
