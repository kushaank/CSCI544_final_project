
Markiesha Ollison began a work-study job as an office assistant in the Dean of Students office the first day of freshman year. It was, she says, one of the most valuable learning experiences of her BU career.

In addition to her four years in the dean’s office, Ollison served as a community advisor for Orientation, president of the College of General Studies Student Government, cochair of the BU Class Gift Committee, and a Warren Towers resident assistant. For her leadership skills and service, she was recently inducted into the Scarlet Key Society , the University’s activities honor society.

Ollison will begin a job next month with the marketing software firm Hubspot , in Cambridge, Mass. Despite the community she’s leaving behind, she says, she has no regrets.

In my first year at BU I had the pleasure to meet new people every single day. Of all of the people I’ve met there are none that fit the combination of extremely intelligent, driven, hard working, funny, and kind like Markiesha does. She was one of the first I met and always one of my favorites and always will be. Thank you Markiesha for being a big part of the best year of my life and helping me fall in love with this school.

Don’t forget about me and a huge congrats on graduating,

Well done, Markiesha!
