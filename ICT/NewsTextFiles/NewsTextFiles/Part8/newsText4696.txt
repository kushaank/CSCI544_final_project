
The Church of Scotland has said it will play a role in healing any divisions    caused by the independence referendum, after the Queen called on people of    faith to “work together for the social good of Scotland whatever the    outcome”.

In her “unusual” letter to the church’s annual General Assembly she recognised    its role in "holding the people of Scotland together".

It was presented at the opening session in Edinburgh at the weekend, in the    presence of Alex Salmond, the First Minister, and expressed apparent concern    about the possible impact of the independence debate on Scottish society.

In its response to the Queen, the Kirk, and its new Moderator, the Right Rev    John Chalmers, said there would be "much work" for ministers    following the historic ballot on September 18.

Its written response added: "We sincerely appreciate Your Majesty's    prayers for the social good of Scotland in this year of referendum.

"Whatever the outcome, we anticipate that there will afterwards be much    work for the Church to do in helping people to address the consequences of    the referendum and to be reconciled with each other."

The Queen said in her letter that the church throughout history had played a    key part in “shaping the governance of Scotland and Scottish society”.

She added: "We recognise that contained within the articles declaratory    of the Church of Scotland, church and state hold mutual duties towards one    another.

"So in this important year of referendum we pray that whatever the    outcome, people of faith and people of goodwill will work together for the    social good of Scotland.

Prof Alan Trench, an honorary fellow in the school of social and political    science at Edinburgh University, said the Queen was obviously concerned that “things could get very nasty as the referendum approaches”.
