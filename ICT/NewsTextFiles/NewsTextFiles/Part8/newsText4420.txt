Dozens of students and three professors had protested the choice of former UC Berkeley chancellor Robert Birgeneau over his handling of an Occupy protest in 2011, the AP reports. He withdrew when protesters demanded an apology, a move that replacement speaker William Bowen, former president of Princeton University, described as an "intemperate" response to the "immature, and, yes, arrogant inclinations of some protesters."

At the core of a college education is the idea of thinking outside the confines of your own narrow experience. How can you broaden your understanding of the world, unless you are willing to open up to it?  These "students" are wasting their time and their parents' money.

Guessing if you were mature, you'd try to find a job that served the kleptocracy.
