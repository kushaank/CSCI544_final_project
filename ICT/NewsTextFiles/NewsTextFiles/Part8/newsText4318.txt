STANTON, Mich. (WZZM) -- A state highway is temporarily closed following a single-vehicle accident that broke a natural gas line Sunday afternoon.

Montcalm County dispatch says the crash happened around 12:44 on M-66 between Pakes and Stanton roads. Both directions of M-66 are closed in that stretch.

A utility crew arrived on-scene around 1:35 to start fixing the gas leak, but they were delayed when they realized they needed to bring in additional equipment to fix the problem.

Montcalm County Undersheriff Mark Bellinger said Central Montcalm High School's graduation ceremony about a mile south of the scene this afternoon means heavy traffic in the area, so he suggests people heading there from the north take E. Stanton Rd. east to Stevenson, Stevenson south to Pakes, and M-66 south to the high school. People heading north after the graduation could take Pakes east to Stevenson, Stevenson north to E. Stanton Rd., and E. Stanton Rd. west to M-66.

No one was injured in the accident.
