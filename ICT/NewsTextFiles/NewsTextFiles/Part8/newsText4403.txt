
TOLLESON, Ariz. - Walking across the stage and being handed your diploma with your fellow classmates by your side is the pay-off for four years of hard work in high school.

But every year hundreds of valley students miss graduation because they can't pass the AIMS test, a requirement to graduate.

They held signs that read, "Let the seniors walk." Seniors at Sierra Linda High School are upset that while graduation is May 21, they will not be able to walk with their classmates because they didn't pass the math AIMS test.

"I am upset because I worked my butt off this year you know, but I did not pass my math aims, so all I'm asking this year is just to walk with my classmates, because this a once in a lifetime event, something I will not experience ever again," said Benito Aguilar.

But the Tolleson School District says its governing board's rule is clear: students who don't satisfy the requirements cannot be part of the graduation ceremony.

The school district said it has sympathy for the students who failed the AIMS test and adds it hopes the students stay in school, get tutoring and stick with it so they can pass the AIMS test and walk across that stage to receive a diploma next year.
