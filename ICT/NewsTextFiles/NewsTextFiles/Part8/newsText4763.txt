
Â Thousands lined the streets of north London to welcome Arsenal's returning heroes after the club completed a remarkable victory in the FA Cup final on Saturday.

Arsenal's home patch of Islington was packed with adoring fans for the victory parade, as the entire first team squad boarded an open top bus and brandished the trophy to their supporters.

Arsene Wenger, who danced like a teenager at Wembley in the immediate aftermath of his team's triumph, was all smiles once again, greeting the club's supporters with a smile as wide as the Wembley arch.

The Gunners eschewed the open top bus parade for their last trophy, the FA Cup of 2005. However, having waited nine years to win another trophy, the club sanctioned a far more rapturous celebration yesterday, and the relief was palpable.

Arsenal won the FA Cup 3-2 on Saturday, overturning a two-goal deficit thanks to strikes from Santi Cazorla, Laurent Koscielny and Aaron Ramsay.
