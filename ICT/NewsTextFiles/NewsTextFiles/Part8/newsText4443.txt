
HAMDEN >> Two adults and a student suffered minor injuries Monday morning when a car hit the back of a school bus at about 7:30 a.m. on Goodrich Street near Dixwell Avenue and Gem Street.

Police said a blue Jaguar sedan slammed into the back of a school bus that was at a complete stop with its red flashing lights activated. Capt. Ronald Smith said in a press release the bus was stopped to pick up students who were standing at the intersection.

The bus was carrying about 15 students who attend the New Haven Academy High School, Smith said.

Police said the car was driven by Joshua Moore, 31, of Hamden. The Jaguar was wedged underneath the bus after the crash.

Moore told police he “looked down for a second” and “when he looked up” he struck the bus, Smith said in the release.

Smith said Moore and the bus driver, whose name wasn’t released, were taken to Yale-New Haven Hospital to be treated for non-life-threatening injuries. A 17-year-old student from New Haven was also taken to the hospital for treatment of minor injuries.

Moore was issued an infraction for failure to keep a safe distance and failure to carry a license.

The accident remains under investigation by Officer David Falcigno of the department’s traffic division.

The bus didn’t appear to have any major damage. The Jaguar was towed from the scene with significant front-end damage.

Part of Goodrich Street was closed for about one hour after the crash.
