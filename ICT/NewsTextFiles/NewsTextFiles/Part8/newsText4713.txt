
PORT DOVER - For some bikers, Port Dover is more than just a ride and a destination - it is also their final resting place.

In the years since the massive Friday the 13th motorcycle rallies got underway in 1981, Port Dover has become hallowed ground for the riding community. The town has come to mean so much to some that they are arranging to be buried here.

One such procession passed through Port Dover Saturday afternoon. At the head of it was Hank Brouwer of Brantford, founder of Boot Hill Hearse. Brouwer was aboard a jet-black trike pulling a specially-designed, glass-paneled hearse containing the cremated remains of Brian “Bear” Fraser, 56, a Sudbury rider who died suddenly last year in British Columbia.

Following behind on motorcycles were family, friends and assorted well-wishers.

Many were there to support Tobey McCool of Lindsay, Fraser’s partner for seven years. The cortege gathered in front of Angelo’s for one last drink before heading to the Port Dover Cemetery. Angelo’s, also dubbed “The Zoo,” was special to McCool and Fraser because that is where they met during a Friday the 13th rally in 2006.

“He said he wanted to be buried in Port Dover because that way he’d never miss a Friday the 13th and he’d always be the first one here,” McCool said.
