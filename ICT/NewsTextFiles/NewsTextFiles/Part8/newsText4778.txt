Peter Nunn, 33, was accused of retweeting messages threatening to rape Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, after she supported a campaign by the feminist Caroline Criado-Perez to feature a woman on the British Â£10 banknote.

Over several weeks, Mr Nunn is accused of sending a series of abusive messages from several Twitter accounts.

Mr Nunn denies sending a message that was offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character by a public electronic network between 28 July and 5 August last year, claiming to have retweeted messages to further debate. The trial continues.
