
Robert Fossey was wounded just five weeks after arriving on the front-line in 1916.

His condition was so serious his parents were given permission to travel from Keighley to France to see him.

Joseph and Abigail Fossey, of New Eng-land Road in Woodhouse, were with their 24-year-old son when he died from his wounds.

Robert was born in the early 1890s, the youngest son of Joseph and Abigail, and subsequent census records showed him living first at Westgate then Leaf Street, both in Keighley. He had five siblings.

Robert was employed by Robert Petty as a painter when he enlisted in early 1915 in the Leeds Pals.

Following training in the Ure Valley and Ripon, he sailed to Egypt on the troopship Empress of Britain to spend several months guarding the Suez Canal.

Robert sailed to Marseilles in March 1916 on the troopship HMT Asconia, by then transferred to another battalion to serve as a bomb thrower.

By May 22, while being treated at a hospital in a safe area away from the frontlines at Etaples, Robert died.

He is remembered on the Ingrow War Memorial and in the Keighley Roll of Honour Book at Keighley Library.

Private Robert Fossey and all the other men featured in the Keighley News each week since January this year, will be displayed upstairs in Keighley Library at a Great War exhibition and open day on Saturday 21st June 2014. We will be there all day for people to bring details and photographs of their own relatives from the Great War which we will be pleased to scan and return straight away, and then carry out research on them.
