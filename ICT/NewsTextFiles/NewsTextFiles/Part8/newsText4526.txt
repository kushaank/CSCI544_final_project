President Obama authorized the funding ahead of a donor's conference in Norway on Tuesday to raise money for the struggling country.

The White House says the assistance includes $50 million to support efforts by the United Nations to aid more than 300,000 refugees who have crossed into Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan and Uganda.

It says more than one million additional people have been displaced inside South Sudan because of the fighting.
