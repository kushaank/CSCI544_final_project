A school in Montclair, New Jersey was evacuated Monday afternoon, after a student brought a relic grenade to school.

The Charles H. Bullock school was evacuated at about 2:30 p.m., when a teacher brought the grenade to the principal's office stating a student had brought it to school.

The principal called the school superintendent's office and the police, and the police requested an evacuation.

Police, firefighters and the bomb squad came and cleared the building.  Authorities indicated the grenade was a training device, or a 'dummy'.

The students returned to the school and were dismissed with a minor delay.
