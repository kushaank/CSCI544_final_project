
FINDLAY, Ohio  — A university in Ohio is being forced to replace almost all its grass after weedkiller was accidentally applied to lawns instead of fertilizer.

University of Findlay spokeswoman Brianna Patterson says that the chemical was applied during the last week of April and that it will take several weeks to reseed and re-sod the affected areas.
