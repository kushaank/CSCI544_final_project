
A senior council boss has told the inquest of a schoolgirl found hanged that he took full responsibility for failures to prioritise the risks to her wellbeing in the planning of her care.

Dana Baker, aged 16, was found dead near the Worcester Road island in Kidderminster on March 3, 2011 after a decision was taken to find her a new foster home.

The teen, who was under the care of a psychiatrist, suffered from post traumatic stress and panic disorders. She also reacted to ‘triggers’ that affected her moods, such as rejection and feeling insecure and had been sexually abused.

Former Worcestershire County Council independent review officer Gordon Robertson told the hearing on Friday it was his job to ensure the authority carried out its duties in respect of care plans.

He told the hearing he should have made sure that the key assessments relating to Dana’s protection were kept in focus.

Mr Robertson said: “That was a mistake on my part. I can only put it down to the fact that I was dealing with so many reviews at the time, I did not give these matters the thorough checking that I should have done before I signed them off."

He said the teen, who had competed for Great Britain in martial arts, was among about 130 cases that the department had to monitor and review.

He went to say: “I should have ensured that an assessment of Dana’s risk of suicide and self harm was addressed at each looked after children review."
