
Models put on display by students of Fiji National University’s School of Building and Civil Engineering had visiting school students as well as senior FNU management excited, at the Science, Engineering and Technology Exhibition.

FNU Deputy Chairman, Arvind Maharaj, who browsed through the booths following the opening ceremony, was so impressed by the models that he encouraged the students to document the project and submit it to him.

“This is very interesting; very creative and precise to be designed and put into model forms by students,” Mr Maharaj said.

Nathan Alfred, a final year Trade Diploma in Civil Engineering student, designed a proposed new and improved look for the Derrick Campus foyer, to cater for the increasing number of intakes every year.

“We always have group works and with that needs space, the main foyer is an ideal place to look into because we have everything accessible from there – coffee shop, bookshop and computer labs,” Alfred said.

Head of School for Building and Civil Engineering higher education, Cyril Rachman, said the displays are all part of the students’ practical work.
