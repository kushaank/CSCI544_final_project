Tillamook High School recently was recognized for its successful foreign-exchange program by AFS-USA, an intercultural student exchange organization.

Students attending the high school this year included Aziz Akhmedov, Eva Deutsch, Fatma Davarci and Joy Odame, who are studying in America under the auspices of the U.S. Department of State.

Each year, AFS-USA places several hundred students with host families nationwide. The high school exchange program focuses on leadership development, civic engagement and cultural awareness. The students come from Germany, the former Soviet republics and countries with significant Muslim populations.

For more information about hosting an exchange student, call Julie Kettner at 503-812-9995.
