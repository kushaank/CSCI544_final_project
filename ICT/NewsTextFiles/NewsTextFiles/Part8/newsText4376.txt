
 PIERRE, S.D. (AP) – The South Dakota Board of Education has held the second of four public hearings on new physical education standards for K-12 schools.   The board met Monday at Northern State University in Aberdeen.  No opponents spoke against the state standards at the hearing. Supporters of the changes have said schools should dedicate enough time to physical education to achieve the new goals.  The standards seek to encourage students to “pursue a lifetime of healthful physical activity.”  At the elementary level they focus on fundamental motor skills. In middle school, students apply those motor skills. In high school, the emphasis is on fitness and wellness.   The board will hold hearings in Pierre and Rapid City this summer. It will take action on the standards after the final hearing.
