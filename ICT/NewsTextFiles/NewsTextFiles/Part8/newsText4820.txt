
DAVID Cameron is visiting the Royal Opera House workshop today.

The Prime Minister is kicking off some electioneering in the south of the county in light of the local and European elections being held on Thursday.

He arrived at the High House Production Park, in Purfleet at around 10am and was shown around the Royal Opera House Bob and Tamar Manoukian production workshop.

Mr Cameron, who is visiting Thurrock for the second time in ten months, after he visited the London Gateway port in Stanford-le-Hope last July, is set to head elsewhere in the region later on the afternoon.

The production park was built by Creative and Cultural Skills, the training and development organisation for the creative industries’ workforce, in response to a need for over 6,500 new jobs in the live music and theatre industries by 2017.

This is his second visit to Essex in less than a month after he visited Colchester – and the offices of the Echo and Thurrock Gazette's sister paper the Gazette – at the start of May.

Wow!. Corr! That news sounds as exciting as watching paint dry.

I'll be surprised if Cam-moran knows where it is, just like he hasn't got a clue (despite personal wealth of £30 million) of how much a pint of milk costs!

Him and Gideon ('George' Osbourne's real name - personal wealth of £40 million)) are clueless!

He wont bother coming to southend as its safe, he treats the town with nothing but contempt, and why shouldn't he when he will get votes no matter what his policy is. Southend is so safe, that  Amess and Duddridge feel they can ignore the concerns of the long term residents and pander to the rapidly growing Islamic community by opening and promoting mosques in westcliff.

Hopefully UKIP will make a big statement this week & regardless of if they can repeat it at the general, it may force the bone idle traitors, Amess and Duddridge, to stop stabbing the community they supposedly serve in the back & at the very least buck their ideas up.

WTF has the fact that George Osbourne has changed his name got to do with the price of fish. I think if we were all named Gideon we'd do the same.

The important thing is "would you trust Ed Balls with your grandchildren's pocket money?". I certainly wouldn't.

oh joys, thats all we need. hopefully this buffoon won't be our PM for much longer fingers crossed.

No me old mucker, you've got the wrong end of the stick!  The crux of the matter is, that these two buffoons are out of touch with every day people because of their privileged background!

'Gideon' changed his name not to appear so aloof and disguise his privileged background, in an attempt to appeal to the common people!

Perhaps you should run for Prime Minister then?  Then again you sound over qualified!  Brush up on your spelling and punctuation first though...capital letters at the start of sentances and when referring to yourself as 'I' for starters!

Neither Margaret Thatcher or John Major went to Public School...along with many others!

Good God, does anyone want Miliband and Ed Balls.

Delusional. We could be just like France - low growth and high unemployment. But that's OK as Hollande is a "socialist". Good grief.

i know what a jar of caviar costs just in case that rules me out.

Who cares - UKIP ARE THE ONLY CHOICE. Everyone - do your duty on Thursday and get out and Vote UKIP.

To be fair i ain't got a clue how much a pint of milk cost, anyway who buys milk by the pint.  I buy six pinters but still have not got a clue what it cost i either need milk or i don't. Know doubt the only thing you are worried about are benefits and the price of fags.

oh joys, thats all we need. hopefully this buffoon won't be our PM for much longer fingers crossed.

No quite right, I'm quite looking forward to Primeminister Ed Miliband....no wait...that would be a massive mistake.

Do the Maths!  Divide the cost of a six pinter by 6...answer, the price of a pint of milk!  Whilst you're at it, practice your English. "Know doubt"?  No doubt, you Numpty!

Right, back to work now, teaching the uninitiated about the pitfalls of smoking!

Are you for real?  UKIP and the BNP are two entirely different animals. But it's lazy journalism that links the two. Same lazy journalism that refers to them as a one trick pony. Same lazy journalism that disregards the grass roots of the Tories and lumps them all in with the upper echelons.

Politics is not that cut and dried. In reality there are loonies in all parties, there are outspoken people who are labelled loonies when they are only telling the truth - and there are those who wouldn't say boo to a goose for fear of whips.

Labour and the Libdems have more than their fair share of freaks and even worse... look at the likes of Cyril Smith (yes I know he's dead) and Harriet Harman. Visit www.labour25.com for more info.

Funny thing is, express an opinion even slightly right of centre and you are automatically labelled by the Idiot Left as "fascist", or "bigoted" or "racist".

These three words are the only ones in the Idiot Left's vocabulary. Apparently I am ex BNP and EDL (funny that, must have joined in my sleep because it's news to me). Even despite the fact that these twerps can research party memberships by their leftwing numpty pals at Searchlight, these rabid nutters still believe what they read on the internet.

Of course, I have come into contact with all parties at counts, events etc but have only ever been a member and candidate of two, the English Democrats and UKIP. I left the first because of the controversy over links with the IRA/BNP. I let my membership of UKIP lapse not because they are right wing fascists but because they are allowing too many UAF nutters within their ranks. When I was a councillor, party politics was not involved.

Anything else you read online is entirely a figment of the imagination of the loony left whose moronic antics are now even alienating their own voters and playing into the hands of their opposers.

UAF make the EDL look like a WI meeting. Unite Against Fascism, ironically the biggest fascists going. Hope Not Hate are a bunch of smelly, rancid soap dodgers. All have one thing in common: they are fantasists. Oh and they have a MASSIVE aversion to deodorant and washing powder.

Labour is riddled with them, the Cons have some and so do the Limpdums.

This is why I remain blissfully free of party politics. I may have friends in different parties but I will vote only for those I consider competent, regardless of their political background. Except Labour/Limpdum of course..I'd rather have root canal treatment.

Quite frankly I couldn't care less if a party of psychopathic gorillas wins Basildon, as long as they are not wearing red rosettes that's all right by me.

Farage is very astute, clever, charismatic and articulate. His downside is he listens far too much to his sycophant satellites.

If you are going to make such statements you need to back them up with a valid argument. I've met Farage several times and always found he answers questions directly, looks you in the eye and gives you a proper answer.

? Or is it just what you read in the Daily Mail/Mirror - as both seem to propagate the same rubbish these days despite their apparent respective right and left wing bias.

Newspapers have now dropped all pretence and are now largely touting a   politically correct agenda.

And ANY garbage spouted by the increasingly deranged UAF/HNH camp you know to be entirely rooted in fantasy.

He wont bother coming to southend as its safe, he treats the town with nothing but contempt, and why shouldn't he when he will get votes no matter what his policy is. Southend is so safe, that  Amess and Duddridge feel they can ignore the concerns of the long term residents and pander to the rapidly growing Islamic community by opening and promoting mosques in westcliff.

Hopefully UKIP will make a big statement this week &amp; regardless of if they can repeat it at the general, it may force the bone idle traitors, Amess and Duddridge, to stop stabbing the community they supposedly serve in the back &amp; at the very least buck their ideas up.

It is not often that I  agree with supermadmax but this is a VERY sensible post.  I could not have put it better myself (except to include the invisible man Mr. Francois with the aforementioned Amess and Duddridge) .All three seem to be politically to the left of Tony Blair.

And - to think - for years I voted Conservative whilst they were a  PROPER Tory party  - now it is hard to differentiate between them and the Labour Party filth.

It seems to me that voting for UKIP would contravene everything I stand for. Here are a few examples.

also, in reference to your last statement.

Makes perfect sense to me. You say that presumably because he is Eurosceptic but then so are Kate Hoey and Frank Field, of the Labour party. Are they embarrassments then? They make perfect sense to me. Kate Hoey made a very good case against in the House of Commons on the day of the referendum debate. Is she an embarrassment? Farage is very astute, clever, charismatic and articulate. His downside is he listens far too much to his sycophant satellites. If you are going to make such statements you need to back them up with a valid argument. I've met Farage several times and always found he answers questions directly, looks you in the eye and gives you a proper answer. What's your experience/knowledge ? Or is it just what you read in the Daily Mail/Mirror - as both seem to propagate the same rubbish these days despite their apparent respective right and left wing bias. Newspapers have now dropped all pretence and are now largely touting a politically correct agenda. And ANY garbage spouted by the increasingly deranged UAF/HNH camp you know to be entirely rooted in fantasy.

So in one post you point us to Labour25 as a source of information but on the other hand we shouldn't believe anything we read from UAF or HNH ? Hard to know what to believe these days.

There is only one difference with Cameron coming to Essex than the normal conman Cameron gets a police escort, he's 2 jags with a blue wrap waiting for a safe pension.
