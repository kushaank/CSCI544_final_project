
See? Hala Sidqi's got a smile on her face again.

Bye bye depression, hello Hollywood! Well, the Arab version of it at least.

It's not easy to pull out of a depressive state, but after seven years of hanging out in the dark pit of despair, Hala Sidqi is on quest to climb her way out to freedom.

The Egyptian actress has decided to overcome her condition, and her first step toward a normal life was accepting the role in the new film "Al Nabatshi" alongside actors Mahmoud Abdel Ghani and May Kassab. The funny film directed by Ismael Farouq marks her return to the comedic roles that made her famous.

The last film Hala had starred in was "Hia Fawda" (It's Chaos) for the late legendary director Yousif Shaheen. After the film, the unfortunate conditions of Egyptian cinema caused her to stay away from acting and become a common spectator of cinema, focusing her efforts on television.

Hala revealed that the new project pulling her out of the pit is a simple comedy that talks about the deprived groups of people in society.

The comeback actress is going full speed ahead into her hopeful career rise with another comedy on the docket. The TV drama "Kayed Al Hamawat" (Vengeance of Mother In Laws) is scheduled to be aired during the coming Ramadan season.
