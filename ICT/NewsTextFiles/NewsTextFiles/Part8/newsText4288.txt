
Blake Skafte-Grieve, 4, is the mini-mayor of Dreamworld.

Well, as it turns out, that’s exactly what has happened to Maitland lad Blake Skafte-Grieve.

On Friday Blake, 4, was named the winner of a national search for a ‘‘mini-mayor’’ of Dreamworld on the Gold Coast.

He beat out fellow finalists Thomas Walmsley, 4, and Nahomi Jones, 6, for the sash.

Blake’s now the theme park’s ‘‘head of happiness’’, and he and his family will get free entry to Dreamworld for the next two years.

NEWCASTLE celebrity watchers were in a tizz on the weekend, with news that Australian super model Miranda Kerr was in town.

Kerr was spotted at Christ Church Cathedral on Saturday wearing what we’re reliably informed was a garment of some sort.

If you’re interested, Topics can reveal she was in town to attend the christening of a friend’s daughter.

The two grew up in Gunnedah, and attended St Mary’s College together, where Kerr was a student from year seven to 10.

So there you are.

ON SATURDAY we asked whether anyone out there was related to the late Barry William Casey, 24, from Newcastle, a Second World War pilot who was shot down over France in 1944.

The museum in Forges-les-Eaux is keen to set up a display dedicated to the fallen crew, and an Englishman named Derek Camp was trying to get in touch with family of the crew.

Well, we’re pleased to report another Barry’s nephew, also Barry Casey, and named after his uncle, has gotten in touch.

Solange’s Elevator, of course.

A spy managed to smuggle this picture out of the Newcastle speak-easy Coal and Cedar.

The secretive small bar (we can tell you it’s somewhere on Hunter Street, but that’s all) has quickly developed a reputation as one of the city’s best night spots, and it appears they have a sense of humour too.
