
Stars of Coronation Street had to race to the TV BAFTAs after taking part in a charity run.

Several famous faces including Julie Hesmondhalgh - aka Hayley Cropper - took part in the Great Manchester Run before heading to London.

The actress obviously neglected the sun cream after posting a picture on Twitter of her face looking a little scorched.

She tweeted: "I believe they call this look BAFTA-ready!"

Corrie beauty Samia Ghadie, who plays Maria Connor, also took part to raise money for the East Cheshire Hospice in Macclesfield.

Soap newcomer Amy Kelly - who plays Sophie Webster's homeless girlfriend Maddie Heath - also took part.
