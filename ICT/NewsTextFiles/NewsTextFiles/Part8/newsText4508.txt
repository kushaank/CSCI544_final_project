
FIVE BROMSGROVE men jetted away on a 1,500 mile trip to Spain - without leaving the ground - to raise money for the Primrose Hospice.

The Sleazy Jet Team which was made up of air hostesses Gary Hunt, Mark Ward, Lee Evans, Steve Law and Captain Garry Yeomans spent four days, last week, travelling from Blackpool to Benidorm for the fancy dress charity banger rally.

The group drove the whole way dressed in their costumes and had spent many hours preparing for their trip and putting the final touches on their custom chariot for the ‘Benidorm or Bust’ event.

Almost 80 other teams and their dolled-up vehicles took part in the special event which went from Blackpool through Dover, Calais, Poitiers and Zaragoza before finally stopping in Benidorm.

For the rally the contestants had to purchase an old banger, worth no more than a few hundred pound, and then adapt it to a theme of their choice before taking on the great navigational challenge.

Mark said the idea seemed like a good one at the time when they all came up with it - in the pub.

He added: “It will be hard to beat next year if we decide to do it again.

“We wore our costumes the whole way so it got a bit uncomfortable, especially since we were not used to wearing tights and skirts.

“It was really good - we were hoping to win the best car and bring home 500euros but we actually won best costumes and as a team won 250euros.
