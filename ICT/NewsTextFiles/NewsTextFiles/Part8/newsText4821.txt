
A 62-year-old man has been charged with indecent assault against a teenage boy as part of an investigation into historic child abuse in North Wales.

Richard Dafydd Vevar, from Wrexham, north Wales, has been charged with two offences against a boy aged between 13 and 16, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said.

The offences are alleged to have taken place between 1986 and 1989.

He has been bailed to appear at Dolgellau Magistrates' Court on June 2.

Vevar is the second man to be charged as part of an investigation into historic child abuse in North Wales, known as Operation Pallial.

Twenty people have been arrested since the new inquiry was announced by Home  Secretary Theresa May in December 2011, following allegations of abuse from children aged between six and 19.

Another man, John Allen, 72, was charged with a string of child sex offences and awaits trial later this year.

Mr Allen faces 39 counts in total, including 29 alleging indecent assault. He denies all charges.

Latest figures show 37 people have been investigated as suspects under Pallial.

A total of 255 people have reported allegations to the NCA, of which information from 212 is under active investigation at this time.

A total of 28 care homes in North Wales currently feature in the investigation.

At the time the investigation was announced, Detective Superintendent Ian Mulcahey, from Merseyside Police, senior investigating officer for the inquiry, said: 'Operation Pallial is investigating new allegations of historic child abuse, some from victims previously known about and some from victims who have come forward for the first time.

'All victims of abuse have a right to expect all allegations of abuse, no matter how much time has passed, to be investigated professionally and appropriately. We will do so.
