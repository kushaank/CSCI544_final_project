
(ANSAmed) - MADRID, MAY 19 - A record number of cruise passengers arrived in Barcelona on Sunday with 31,600 visitors landing in a single day from seven cruise ships arrived at the city of Gaudi, according to data released Monday by the Barcelona Port .

Among the ships docked was the 'Norwegian Epic', the third ship largest cruise in the world.   Due to a mass presence of visitors, local businesses remained opened on Sunday, bringing in an estimated 3.5 million euros of receipts thanks to the day's tourist expenditures, according to trade associations.

In September 16 to 18, 2014, Barcelona will host for first time the Seatrade Med convention, the main biennial specialized cruise meeting in the Mediterranean, according to world cruises destinations. The Port Authority expects to receive more than 4,000 attendees and 300 exhibitors and service providers to the cruise market, with high-level conferences focused on the key question about the rapid expansion of cruises in the region; an exhibition area on training for travel agents and networking events, whose organization the Port has a key role.

Sources for the Port of Barcelona emphasized, while talking with ANSAmed, that the convention coincides with the first call of the largest cruise liner in the world, the Oasis of the Seas (Royal Caribbean), with a capacity of 6,300 passengers, which this year will call Catalan capital as its home port. These two events will strengthen the leadership of the Port, which in the following year will receive Allure of the Seas, the sister ship of the Oasis of the Seas, and has planned 25 stops in Barcelona.

A flow of 175,000 cruise passengers is anticipated, with a financial revenue impact on the city estimated at 17.5 million euros. (ANSAmed).
