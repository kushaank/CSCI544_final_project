
Two burglars rummaged through a Norman family’s car right in front of signs that clearly said they were on camera, police said.

The family asked for the public’s help Monday to find the thieves.

"They're very comfortable in what they're doing, and they take their time, so you feel very victimized," Crystal Calfy said.

Calfy’s children found the inside of the car ransacked before heading to school Monday morning.

"Immediately, I worry what goes through their mind. Now they're going to have to go to school with this on their mind all day long," she said.

Norman police said car burglaries are common.

"Probably our most persistent and numerous crime is auto burglaries," said Capt. Tom Easley of the Norman Police Department. "The bottom line is, if you don't want it stolen, don't leave it in your car."

After suffering car break-ins in the past, the Calfys removed valuables from their cars, and the burglars didn’t take anything.

Family members said they hope someone will recognize the burglars and report them before they hit the neighborhood again.
