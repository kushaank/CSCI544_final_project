RETIREMENT has been a long time coming for specialist furniture expert Geoffrey Backman, who has almost 50 years’ experience in the antiques industry.

He will say goodbye to Backman’s Fine Furniture’s Tindale Street showroom this month after more than two decades.

Mr Backman began work in the specialist furniture manufacturing industry in the mid 1960s in South Australia and said it was something he had always been interested in.

He worked in SA for 28 years before opening his Mandurah business 20 years ago and said it was sad to know he was closing.

“When I first started my mentor was a furniture maker – he did his apprenticeship 100 years ago and things have changed a lot since then,” he said.

“One of the highlights was working on antique imports from London, the workmanship and the timber was exquisite.

Mr Backman said his years in the industry had left him with too many stories to count.

Another memorable job was completely reassembling a piano that had slipped off the back of a truck and smashed.

“There was also some furniture that had been stored in a container up north and termites had gotten in and eaten half a billiard table,” he said.

Mr Backman, who lives at the Lady Brand lifestyle village, said the work became too much for him.

Mr Backman said he planned to take up bowls again with his newly found spare time and said he wanted to keep active.
