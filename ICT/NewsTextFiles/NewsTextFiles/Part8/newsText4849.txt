
The Competition Protection Comission (CPC) has fined Toplofikatsia, Sofia's heating utility, for occupying a dominant position on the market.

Toplofikatsia is now due to pay BGN 62 000 of fine after the competition watchdog ruled it was imposing the same prices to companies distributing its heating energy. The Commission says this deprives consumers of the opportunity to choose a provider according to the "pricing" criteria.

With its actions, the heating utility hinders competition on the market of heating distribution, as the regulator's position was quoted by Dariknews.bg.

The decision can be appealed with the Supreme Administrative Court.
