
IN 2009, a referendum was held in Switzerland on the building of minarets in the country. The results of the referendum was that 57.5 percent of those who voted supported the ban on building future minarets in the country. As the referendum was for a constitutional amendment, it had legal force and mosques built in Switzerland now cannot have minarets.

Using the logic employed by some of us here in Malaysia, the Muslims of Switzerland must just accept the ban. They must ‘respect the majority’. They must ‘respect the sensitivities’ of the people, 95 of whom are not Muslims. The wishes of the few must make way for the rights of the many. This is touted to be ‘democracy’, used to justify violations of human rights and fundamental liberties of our fellow citizens.

The Swiss minaret ban was challenged in the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) a few years ago, but were rejected on the basis that the applicants were not victims since they did not intend to build a minaret.

In 2011, France imposed a ban prohibiting garments that conceal the face in public, effectively banning the burqa or niqab in public. A Muslim woman has recently filed a case in the ECHR claiming that the ban violated her right to privacy, freedom of religion and freedom of expression. The ECHR will decide whether indeed her human rights have been violated by the ban.

In both instances, the restrictions imposed were legal and constitutional. It is within the legal framework of the respective countries. In France, while the ban still stood, another woman had her conviction affirmed by the French Court which threw out her challenge to the constitutionality of the ban.

In the face of such legal hurdles, Muslims in Switzerland and France turn to human rights as the basis of their case. That their basic human right to freedoms of religion and expression have been violated by the State.

Yes, human rights. The dangerous ‘ism’ threatening Malaysia, according to some. The symbol of debauchery and moral decay, and the erosion of ‘Islamic values’. Ironically, this very same ‘ism’ is what will ultimately protect the Muslims in these Western countries from violations of their religious freedoms.

This is human rights. The rights guaranteed on all, regardless of nationality, race, ethnicity, religion, belief, class, social status or sexual identity. Human rights ensures that the tyranny of the majority will not infringe the rights of the minority, even that infringement is permitted by law.

Remember Nazi Germany and the prosecution and persecution of minority communities in Europe? No one can argue that there have not been gross violations of human rights during World War II. Yet for the most part, the actions of the Nazis were entirely legal.

If human rights are so dangerous, then why do we sit the Human Rights Council of the United Nations? If human rights are a threat, why did our Parliament form the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia, SUHAKAM? Human rights are not our enemy. We should stop decrying them as some sort of disease afflicting our society while at the same time telling the world that we ‘respect and uphold human rights’ without batting an eyelid.

It would be hypocritical for us to decry the violations of religious freedoms France and Switzerland but at the same time claim that ‘human rights is incompatible with Islam’ or that religious freedoms of minorities must be subjected to ‘sensitivities’ of the majority.

Human rights must be protected, regardless, as human rights are for all.

It is time for all those who want to see the end of the Sedition Act to come together to make the Government repeal the Sedition Act.

Shopping at the many air-conditioned complexes in the city may be more comfortable, but if you want to feel the heartbeat of Kuala Lumpur, you must sample the night bazaar in Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman during Ramadan.

The tradition of monarchy in the United Kingdom has endured for centuries. It is not laws that protect and uphold the crown. It is the support of the British populace, who still think that the UK throne is still relevant in todayâs world, that guarantees its place.

Laws are not the answer to everything. We cannot force people to not say insensitive things about a dead person. Harmony and unity cannot be legislated; they must come naturally.

IT all started with some chocolates. Some tests were carried out and traces of porcine DNA were found. And just like that, pandemonium ensued.

All of us have something to gain from universal human rights.

To take one aspect of Islamic law and to import it into the current system would not do justice to hudud and the Syariah as a whole. Hudud should be implemented only in a state where all the institutions of the state are in line with the Syariah.

WITH the passing of the late, great Karpal Singh, you get a sense that for many, the nation has indeed lost one of its most illustrious sons. It is one thing seeing it from his friends, political colleagues and constituents, but we also saw genuine sadness and respect from those he opposed.
