
At Cannes, Manu Kumaran, CEO of production facility Medient Studios, discussed his plans for a new studio in Georgia - the company's largest in the US - which is set to be constructed by the end of this year and will be in direct competition with Pinewood's new studio complex in Atlanta.

The company, which has studios in India and the US, hopes that by modernising the production process of big budget features and hiring permanent employees that can simultaneously work on a variety of projects, they will be able to reduce their costs by 40%.

The new site will be fully eco-friendly and include stages for Medient and other productions, post-production facilities, offices and will even provide housing.

Last year, the company started building near Savannah. Kumaran said the first phase of construction focussing on the soundstages would start in the coming week. Additional construction will take place over the coming years.

Asked about the competition from the UK studio giant Pinewood Shepperton, which is close to completing a complex in nearby Atlanta, the CEO said: "They [Pinewood] offer a dry lease and are landlords. We are a full-service rental for productions." He also said Medient would be able to offer financing by taking a stake in productions.

At the new facility, Kumaran plans to shoot several versions of certain films so they are suitable for various international markets - such as the Chinese and Indian markets for example.

The firm chose Georgia for its tax incentives and positive attitude towards the production industry.
