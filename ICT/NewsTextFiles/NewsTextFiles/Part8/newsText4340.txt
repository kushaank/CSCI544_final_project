
Meridian, Miss. A Meridian church honored several young men and women during a baccalaureate service Sunday evening.

Historic First Union Missionary Baptist Church hosted a special ceremony to honor all students in the community for their achievements. The ceremony, entitled "Celebrating Success One Step at a Time," presented certificates and bibles to the students in attendance.

"We're just trying to make sure our kids who have been promoted can know that we continue to believe in their success and we want to help them to strive to be the best that they can be and know they're achievers," Rev. Gary Houston says. "With all the negative stuff going on we want to just say that we have young folks who are positive and we want to promote that positive attitude."

Dr. Alvin Taylor of the Meridian Public School District was the guest speaker.
