
The first British military aircraft has been deployed to help search for more than 200 kidnapped schoolgirls missing in Nigeria.

A Sentinel reconnaissance aircraft with Lincolnshire-based 5 (Army Cooperation) Squadron left RAF Waddington this morning bound for the Ghanaian capital of Accra, west of Nigeria, where Islamist terror group Boko Haram and their captives are in hiding.

The state-of-the-art jet will join US aircraft in attempting to locate the girls, who were seized from a school dormitory on April 15.

The move comes as Foreign Secretary William Hague yesterday urged west African nations to come together to defeat Boko Haram during international crisis talks in Paris.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said:"I am pleased that Britain's armed forces have been able to support the international search operation and provide the specialist skills which could help the Nigerians locate their missing children."

UK experts are already working with a US team in the country trying to establish where the girls are being held.
