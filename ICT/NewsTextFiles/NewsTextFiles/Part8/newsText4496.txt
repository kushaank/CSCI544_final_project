
Mumbai :Â  Actor Salman Khan has arrived at the Mumbai Sessions Court to attend a hearing in the 2002 hit-and-run case allegedly involving him.

One person was killed and four were injured in the accident when the actor's car allegedly ran over a group of people in suburban Bandra.

Earlier this month, three eyewitnesses had testified before the court and identified the actor.

Mr Khan, 47, was present for the hearing held on May 6, during which one of the survivors claimed that the actor was so drunk on the night of the accident that he fell down, then got up and ran away from the accident site.

The witness, who was injured in the accident, had claimed that he saw Mr Khan getting out from the right side of the Toyota Land Cruiser; the actor's lawyers have argued for nearly a decade that he was not at the wheel.

One of the witnesses had complained to the police that she had received a threatening call in connection to the case. The court had scheduled the issue for the next hearing.

In December, a Mumbai court ordered a fresh trial for Mr Khan, who is accused now of culpable homicide in the hit-and-run case and faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.

He originally faced lesser charges of rash and negligent driving.

In 1998, Mr Khan had spent a few days in prison for killing blackbuck deer, an endangered species, in Rajasthan.
