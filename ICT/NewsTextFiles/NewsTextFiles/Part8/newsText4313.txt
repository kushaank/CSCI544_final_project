She is 12th in her senior class, with a weighted 4.0 grade point average.  She is involved in Peer Leadership, National Honor Society, RoKapa Social Studies Honor Society and South’s newspaper.  Writing is her passion.  She is a District award winner for poetry, and has won academic awards in English and World Languages.

She wants to study English in college and become an English teacher and a writer.  Scroggins volunteers with senior citizens and is a reading tutor at South.

With her scholarship, she hopes to travel to New York, Washington, D.C., Chicago and abroad to be inspired for the stories she wants to write.  Her father, Robert, works at South Mountain.  She will be attending the University of San Francisco next fall.
