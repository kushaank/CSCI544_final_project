
If you have a capital problem, if no one else can help, and if you can persuade them, maybe you can cozy up to one of the world’s sovereign wealth funds.

Certainly these investment vehicles, usually set up by oil-rich countries to manage state savings, have proved themselves willing to back a whole host of banks since the credit crunch.

And in case anyone thought the era of seeking help from deep-pocketed friends was over, Deutsche Bank has reminded us that it’s not. It’s just secured backing from the The Qatari royal family to the tune of €1.75 billion ($2.38 billion) via its investment vehicle Paramount Holdings.

It is no mystery why European have frequently made the trip to the Middle East, Singapore or China with their caps in hand. It is less obvious why the sovereign wealth funds have been so obliging.

One reason: they have the money and, together with a dwindling band of other investors, believe western banks may be undervalued and a good way to bet on recovering economies.

But more importantly, sovereign wealth funds have patience. Unlike insurance companies and pension funds, they have no long-term debt or future liabilities. Also unlike other institutional investors, they don’t face regulatory restrictions about what they can invest in.

Many sovereign wealth funds also operate out of countries that are keen to promote their financial centers, set up as a means to diversify their economies away for natural resources revenues, and presumably feel that closer relationships with big banks will help their cause.

Earlier this month, reports emerged that Kuwait’s sovereign wealth fund was backing Williams & Glyn’s, a new “challenger” bank that is being launched in the U.K. by the Royal Bank of Scotland . The Kuwait Investment Office also has stakes in Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group.

And it’s not just European banks who’ve been the beneficiary of sovereign wealth funds’ largesse.
