
Srinagar, May 19: A minor girl was killed while her brother, also a minor, received critical injuries after an unexploded shell went off in a village near Tosamaidan firing range in district Budgam Monday.

The sprawling meadow is being used by the army as a firing range since 1965.

"The kids were returning from the school when the explosion took place at around 1.40 pm, a senior police officer said. "The boy is undergoing treatment at B&J hospital at Barzulla, he added.

Police said though the area doesnt fall in Tosamaidan firing range, the shell had drifted via Suresh Nallah passing through the area.

Police said they have apprehensions that more shells could have drifted via the Nallah, threatening peoples lives. "Presence of more shells in the area cant be ruled out," police said.

The tragic incident triggered massive protests in the area demanding immediate issuance of notification for cancellation of the firing range.

According to officials, unexploded shells in and around Tosamaidan firing range have killed and maimed around 63 people. However locals put the number at around 170.

The government has already constituted a committee under chairmanship of Chief Secretary to identify alternate site for relocation of the Tosamaidan firing range.

Meanwhile, TosamaidanBachao Front (TBF), a civil society group, spearheading the agitation for vacation of the meadow by the Army, Monday threatened to launch an agitation if the notification regarding cancellation of lease was not issued by May 25.

In a statement issued here, the TBF also urged the government to appoint special team to dispose of military waste and unexploded shells in and around Tosamaidan.
