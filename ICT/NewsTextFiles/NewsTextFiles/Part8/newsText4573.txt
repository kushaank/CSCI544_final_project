
An 11-year-old Meath boy has been hailed as a hero for saving his grandfather’s life after the car in which they were travelling crashed after his grandfather suffered a blackout at the wheel.

However, Charlie Cullen has attributed his heroics to the morally ambiguous protagonists of the computer game Grand Theft Auto.

On April 1, Charlie, from Slane, Co Meath, was being driven home by his grandad Finn, who suddenly slumped at the wheel without warning.

As the car sped up, Charlie took control of the wheel and managed to steer the car away from traffic towards Slane Castle, where the car hit a wall and came to a stop.

According to Charlie,  Grand Theft Auto gave him enough insight to steer the car away from danger, and  adrenaline kicked in once he took control of the wheel.

With his grandfather still blacked out and now bleeding, Charlie managed to help Finn out of the car and get him home.

Speaking on The Mooney Show on RTÉ, Charlie said his first thought was to get Finn to his house nearby.

Charlie said the ambulance was there “in a flash” and his grandfather was tended to.

Finn said it was “a miracle” nobody was killed in the accident and that his grandson’s quick actions saved his life.
