
Suki Waterhouse has arrived in the South of France over the weekend to throw her sunhat in the ring. And she was quick out of the blocks with a gorgeous printed navy Armani Prive dress worn to the Vanity Fair and Armani party on Saturday night (and featured in a fair few selfies with Justin Bieber).

This was followed by a strapless pale lilac/pink Dior dress for Sunday’s premiere of The Homesman at the Palais des Festivals.

With its tiered skirt, it was reminiscent of the 22-year old model’s stunning Met Gala Burberry gown which topped many of the best dressed lists (and made all the headlines before everything kicked off in THAT lift).

Bradley Cooper’s squeeze also popped up at the Relativity at 10 party at the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc earlier in the evening, this time wearing a quirky, yet still effortlessly chic, Peter Pilotto print dress.

Blake signed off from the festival in style on Friday night, accompanying hubby Ryan Reynolds to the premiere of his new movie, The Captive.

This was glamour to the power of two. So, if Suki wants to stay in contention for that Cannes fashion crown, she might just have to call on Bradley.
