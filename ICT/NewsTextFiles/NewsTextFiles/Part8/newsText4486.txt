
Egyptian presidential candidate Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi met on Monday with Saudi Arabia's Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal as well as a number of a number of Egyptian actors.

A statement released on El-Sisi's official Facebook page said the former military chief met with Talal, who is also chairman of the Kingdom Holding Company (KHC), to listen to the latter's vision on Egypt's economic future and how to improve the country's investment environment.

During the meeting, El-Sisi expressed his gratitude to Talal for Saudi's role in supporting Egypt's economy in the recent period.

El-Sisi said in a previous interview that Saudi Arabia will be the first country he will visit if elected president.

In a second meeting on Monday, Sisi also met with Egyptian actors, describing them as the "bulwark in the face of extremism." The actors who attended included Faten Hammama and Ezzat El-Alaili.

Egyptian expats wrapped up voting at embassies across the world this week, while Egyptians at home will cast their ballots on 26-27 May.

El-Sisi is contending with leftist Hamdeen Sabahi, who came in third in the 2012 presidential race.

retired field marshal Sissi is today a presidential contendant , so he is  Mister Sissi. He is going too fast in having international talks and positions. Just two weeks then he will certainly be president and be be able to speak and act as so. Don't rush things !
