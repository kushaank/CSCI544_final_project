
Each year Colorado waters are home to dozens of boating accidents.

In an effort to help bring these numbers down, Colorado Parks and Wildlife is hosting several boating safety courses across the southeast region.

In Colorado, operators of motorboats must be at least 16 years old, however 14 and 15 year olds may operate a motorboat if they pass a boating safety course.

Those older than 16 are still invited to attend the classes, especially if they are first-timers out on the water.

"It's always a good idea to brush up on your safety skills," said Joe Stadterman, Ranger at Lake Pueblo State Park. "And sometimes insurance companies will even offer discounts to adults who take a boat safety class."

Manuals will be sent to the registered students. Students must read and study the Boating Safety in Colorado manual prior to attending the course, so sign up early.

Boat operator cards will be issued to students who attend the course and pass the final exam with a score of 70 percent or above. Students must bring their $15 registration fee and 1" by 1" photo, which will be laminated onto their operator card.

When heading out on the water remember that Colorado requires there to be one life jacket per person on board, in the correct size and in good and serviceable condition.

Children under 13 are required to wear a lifejacket at all times on a boat unless they are inside an enclosed cabin.

Trinidad Lake State Park is home to a new life jacket loaner stand, where boaters can borrow a life jacket for up to a week at a time at no cost.

"It's an extremely important piece of equipment and I've personally seen life jackets save lives," said Dara Garretson, Park Ranger at Trinidad Lake. "A life jacket will keep someone afloat if they've been knocked unconscious in the water and that thick padding has saved people from serious injury when struck by heavy equipment . A life jacket will also help keep a person warm and fight hypothermia in cold water."
