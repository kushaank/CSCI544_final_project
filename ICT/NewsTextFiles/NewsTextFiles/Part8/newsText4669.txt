
The 51-year-old was jeered by her family and supporters as prison officers led him away from the Central Criminal Court.

The woman was 71 years old when she was raped by her nephew at knife point at her home in Co Louth.

The jury heard he arrived at her home at 7am on a Sunday morning having only ever visited her on one previous occasion a week earlier.

When she went to the kitchen to make him tea he put a knife to her throat, threatened her and raped her in an ordeal that lasted three hours.

He claimed the sex was consensual but he was convicted of rape and sexual assault by a jury following an eight-day trial last month.

In victim impact evidence, the court heard the woman, who is now 75, has been left feeling ashamed, scared of men and shaking with fear everytime the doorbell rings.

The court heard the accused was unlawfully at large on the day of the rape having absconded from a British prison while on day release.

Mr Justice George Bermingham jailed the 51-year-old for 14 years having noted that he has not expressed one word of regret or remorse.
