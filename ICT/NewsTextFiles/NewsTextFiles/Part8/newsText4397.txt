
In this screengrab a pupil is seen trying to grab the broom from the man who is attacking another pupil at  Stanwest Combined School in Mpumalanga.

A man has been caught on camera repeatedly assaulting a pupil with a broom.

In the video the pupil is hit in the face by the broom and crashes to the floor behind a desk. The man continues to beat him repeatedly with a broomstick. At one point the pupil is struck so hard the head of the broom flies off. Finally the man walks away as other pupils rush to the fallen pupil’s assistance.

The Mpumalanga Department of Education was not available for comment, but Eyewitness News reported that the department was investigating the incident. EWN also reported that the man in the video had been arrested for assault on Friday and would be appearing in court soon.

Where is the teacher?? One would hope that this man was fired and that charges of assault were laid.  Unbelievable!
