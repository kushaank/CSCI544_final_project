
MOORE, Okla. (AP) — Deep scars remain a year after a deadly tornado carved a 17-mile path through the heart of this Oklahoma City suburb and killed 24 people, including seven elementary school children.

Especially for the families of those who lost loved ones and for the surviving students traumatized after riding out the fearsome storm.

In August, students will return to two newly built schools, both being constructed with safe-room shelters.

Ten-year-old Kai Heuangpraseuth (huh-RUNG-pruh-suth) says he's excited about the new school, but still troubled by severe weather and loud noises.

Christopher Legg won't be there, but the 9-year-old's mother says perhaps her son's death will hurt a little less if it leads to safer schools. Danni Legg has found some comfort by pouring herself into advocating for more safe rooms and shelters.
