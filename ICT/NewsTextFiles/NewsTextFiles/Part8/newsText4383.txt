At all AAPT locations, the school offers a variety of graduate placement services , including individual career guidance, employer networking, monthly updates on job openings, and quarterly in-house Career Expo events where local employers are invited to meet and greet with AAPT students. Even in the months and years following a student’s graduation, AAPT’s placement staff is always available to extend a helping hand to its graduates.

Headquartered in New York City with branches in Boston and now Ft. Lauderdale, AAPT is a nationally accredited, private occupational school, widely recognized for its innovative approach to hands-on personal training education.
