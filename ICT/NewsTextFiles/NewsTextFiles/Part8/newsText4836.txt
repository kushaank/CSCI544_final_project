
The NDC General Secretary recently noted that “it doesn’t make sense” that Ghana is keeping an estimated $120 million from the Heritage Fund in an offshore account when the country is smarting under economic hardships arising out of lack of funds in the national kitty.

But Sam George, a communicator for the party widely believed to have the President’s blessing to contest the National Youth Organizer position of the NDC, counseled fellow panelists, viewers and listeners of News Files to treat MrAsieduNketsia and Fiifi Kwetey’s proposal on the use of the fund as nothing but individual views.

President Mahama’s opposition to the proposal, our sources added; stems from the fact that law that brought into force the Heritage Fund, the Petroleum Management Act, 2011 (Act 815), was sponsored by an NDC government, therefore, it is imprudent to turn to the fund within the short period it was created.

While it is clear to many that Sam George lacks the capacity to publicly scold Asiedu Nketsia and Fiifi Kwetey in the manner he did, sources say he only carried the cross of the presidency to state his position on the matter.

The use of the song, which literally means we shall not listen to anyone or we shall not mind anyone, the NDC General Secretary noted; does not bode well for consensus building.

Though some members of the NDC, like the president seemed to have fallen in love with the Daddy Lumba hit song, with some even proposing the song be adopted as official campaign hit for 2016, MrAsiedu Nketsiah warned that the use of the song was wrong particularly as it relates to president Mahama who is been hailed as affable and a listening president.
