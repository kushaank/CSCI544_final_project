
WESTMORELAND, Jamaica -- Hundreds of commuters, including students and hotel workers were left stranded this morning after disgruntled residents blocked several sections of the roads in eastern Westmoreland in protest over deplorable road conditions.

The irate demonstrators used huge trees and other debris to block several thoroughfares from Bellefield to Bluefields in the parish.

OBSERVER ONLINE understands that some workers employed to Sandals Whitehouse were unable to get transportation to work, as all the road networks leading to the Whitehouse area were blocked to vehicular traffic.

Several students attending Maud McLeod High School, Mannings High, and New Hope Primary also had to head back home.

The police are now working to remove the numerous blockages, but protestors have engaged the cops in a cat-and-mouse game, restaging the roadblocks as they turn their backs.

The demonstrators are calling on their elected representatives to address the deplorable state of roads in the parish.
