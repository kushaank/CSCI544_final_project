
The Executive Director of Healthy Ghana, Professor Agyemang Badu Akosa, has slammed the polarized nature of Ghana’s politics, saying it hinders growth and development.

He is, therefore, calling for an immediate end to the political rivalry that has befallen Ghana.

“I think the political polarization is [snatching] something good out of this country; I think it does not bring the best out of Ghanaians,’’ he said.

Speaking at the launch of a book titled, "The President’s Physician,’’ the former Director General of the Ghana Health Service said he wished the rivalry and the polarization amongst politicians to be left alone to exist amongst schools.

“Just want us to end this polarization of our political space because this country belongs to all of us; and no single party has the men and women that can virtually transform this country. We need to do it all together,’’ he explained.

Prof. Akosa warned that the only way for Ghana to develop and compete with the rest of the world is to put an end to the "tittle-tattle" nature of our politics.

“As far as I am concerned, whether it is NDC, NPP, CPP, PPP; we are in the political space to do good for this country and that should be our focus,’’ he noted.

”We need to do it all to gather,’’ he emphasized.
