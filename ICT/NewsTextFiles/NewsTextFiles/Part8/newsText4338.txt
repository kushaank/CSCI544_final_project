CAMBRIDGE (AP) -- U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she's pushing for equal pay, a higher minimum wage and student-loan refinancing because they can directly improve the economic lives of women and working families.

Warren said two out of three minimum-wage earners are women and raising the wage to $10.10 would benefit 14 million children.

The Massachusetts Democrat also said having children is the most reliable predictor of bankruptcy and that single mothers who attend college are 60 percent more likely to go bankrupt than single mothers who don't.

Warren has filed a bill to ease student-loan debt.

U.S. Rep. Katherine Clark, speaking at the same forum Monday, said she'll file her first bill Tuesday aimed at making child care more accessible for children up to 3 years old, typically the most expensive and hardest to find.
