
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will visit Seoul next Monday for talks with his South Korean counterpart Yun Byung-se, as the two countries seek to put a stop to North Korea's nuclear ambitions.

On top of the agenda will be fine-tuning the details of Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Seoul.

Xi is expected to make his first trip to South Korea since becoming president in the coming months.

Although a specific date has not been set, South Korean government officials say the summit may take place in the first half of this year.

Another pending issue on the table will be the possibility of a fourth nuclear test by North Korea.

While North Korea appears ready to conduct a test at anytime, Beijing may use Wang's visit to send a clear message to Pyongyang that its nuclear ambitions will not be tolerated and could result in stronger sanctions.

At the same time, it could reiterate the need for dialogue to settle tensions on the Korean peninsula.

Beijing and Seoul, during Wang's visit, may also exchange opinions about Japan's denial of history and its push for collective self-defense.

Both nations, major victims of Tokyo's past militarism, have voiced concerns over the Abe administration's pursuit to revise its pacifist constitution without fully recognizing the country's wartime atrocities.

The revision would allow Japan to come to the defense of an ally under attack, a revival of bitter World War Two memories for the two nations.

"During his two-day stay in Seoul, the Chinese diplomat will also visit with President Park Geun-hye and Presidential Security Advisor Kim Jang-soo.
