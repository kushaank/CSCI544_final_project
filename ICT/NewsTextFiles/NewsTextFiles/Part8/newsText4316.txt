
Board members and the Logan County Schools Superintendent were in attendance to receive findings from its recent on-site reviews through the Office of Education Performance Audits (OEPA). During its presentation to the WVBOE, the OEPA made several recommendations concerning curriculum, finance, personnel and leadership.

The OEPA commended Logan County for making strides to increase the availability of technology within its schools but said technology needs to become more integrated into its curriculum. Findings also reported that while Logan County has more students attend college than the state average, a number of its graduates must take remedial courses. Additional curriculum items discussed included the county’s proficiency in math and language arts, the offering of advanced place courses for high school students, and the need to increase graduation rates.

Responsibilities and compliance with state policies were addressed for the school system’s personnel and financial departments along with changes that must be made to the Logan County Board of Education’s five-year strategic plan. Additionally, OEPA encouraged the importance of leaders to work cooperatively within schools and the central office to increase student achievement and comply with state standards and the need to upgrade facilities to meet ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) standards.

Superintendent Phyllis Doty reported Logan County Schools will address the findings immediately and requested the assistance of an improvement consultant team to develop a corrective action plan.

The Logan County Board of Education will be submitting revisions to its five-year strategic plan within thirty days, and a follow-up regarding the OEPA’s findings will take place in January 2015.
