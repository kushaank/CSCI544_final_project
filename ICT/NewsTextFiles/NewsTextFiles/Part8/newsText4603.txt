
Borehamwood and Elstree's twin town association took to the streets in France to promote the town overseas.

The twinning group visited the French twin town of Fontenay Aux Roses at the weekend to witness its annual festival and carnival.

The group also attended a reception to celebrate the townâ€™s links in Europe, which span 40 years.

Former Mayor Councillor Clive Butchins also represented the town at an event to welcome the new Mayor of Fontenay Aux Roses, Laurent Vastel, into office.

This visit was publicised at the begining of December in BWT, and was open to everyone. The association organised the accommodation and travel, to which ALL paid for the trip. The council didnot assist with any funding for this visit.
