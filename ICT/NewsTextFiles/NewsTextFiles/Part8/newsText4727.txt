
A U.S. jury found Mustafa Kamel Mustafa guilty Monday of supporting terrorism around the world from his perch at a London mosque.

Mustafa, an Egyptian Islamic preacher, was brought to the U.S. to stand trial in federal court in New York City.

Mustafa's intense sermons attracted extremists to his mosque in London before and after 9/11.

He also was accused of providing support to kidnappers in Yemen, trying to start an al-Qaida training camp in Oregon, and for sending at least one man to a training camp in Afghanistan.

Mustafa was extradited from England in 2012. He led the Finsbury Park Mosque in London in the 1990s. That same mosque was reportedly attended by Sept. 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui and shoe bomber Richard Reid. Mustafa denies meeting either Moussaoui or Reid.

But Assistant U.S. Attorney Ian McGinley urged jurors to focus on the evidence and ignore Mustafa's lies. McGinley read the names of four European tourists who were killed in a kidnapping in Yemen in 1998. Twelve others survived in the kidnapping.

Mary Quin was one of those kidnapped. She interviewed Mustafa in London as she prepared a book about the kidnapping. In the interview Mustafa bragged to Quin that the kidnapping was a good thing for Islam.

McGinley used what Mustafa told Quin to contradict an earlier claim by Mustafa. Mustafa had said he tried to be a peacemaker during the kidnapping.

In a 2002 interview with CBS Mustafa shed of accustations of connections to terrorism.
