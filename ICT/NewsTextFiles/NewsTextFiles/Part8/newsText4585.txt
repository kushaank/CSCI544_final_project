
Daniel Zuchnik/Getty Images(LOS ANGELES) -- Actress America Ferrera said she "didn't even know what happened" after a man tried to climb under her dress on the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival.

"I feel something behind me, and there's this guy under my dress, and then two guys drag him away!" the How to Train Your Dragon 2 star, 30, told Vulture after the incident.

The man, who was dragged out from under her cream tulle skirt and arrested, was identified as Vitalii Sediuk, no stranger to these stunts.

"Of all of the things I prepared myself for, that was not one of them," Ferrera said, agreeing that it was violating.

"It’s my first time in Cannes. It’s been quite an experience!" the actress said. "If you’d asked me what my first experience at Cannes was going to be, I would not have imagined there would be dragons. I would not have imagined there would be, um, ankle biters on the carpet."

Security had to come and drag the man away, while Ferrera held her poise alongside co-stars Cate Blanchett, Jay Baruchel, Kit Harrington and Djimon Hounsou.

Ferrera added: "And, I will say, I’ll never, ever forget the feeling of when we came out of the screening. Walking out hand in hand with your cast -- Cate Blanchett to my left, by the way, holding my hand -- it felt like a crazy weird dream. It was like, 'I was at Cannes in my dream. I was on the red carpet and Cate Blanchett was next to me, and then some guy jumped under my dress!'"
