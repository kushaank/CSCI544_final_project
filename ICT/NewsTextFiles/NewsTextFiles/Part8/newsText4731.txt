
19 MAY 2014 Kylie Minogue and Peter Andre were among a stellar list of celebrities who turned out to give their support at the annual Butterfly Ball , and HELLO! can reveal they also met up with some of the children and families earlier in the day at an exclusive meet-and-greet.

"The work that John and everyone at Caudwell Children do is so inspiring," said Kylie as she met up with some of those who have benefited from the charity, ahead of the evening celebrations last Thursday at London's Grosvenor House Hotel.

The charity's ambassador Peter Andre added, "The glitz and glamour of the evening is fantastic. But you only have to scratch beneath the surface to see the truly incredible work Caudwell Children too."

The evening, which raised £2.5million for the charity founded by John Caudwell to help youngsters and their families in the UK, was also attended by Sarah, Duchess of York, Simon Cowell, Tamara and Petra Ecclestone, Holly and Nicky Candy, David Furnish, Petra Nemcova and Sinitta.

Trudi Beswick, Chief Executive of Caudwell Children told HELLO!: “It has been an overwhelming success, everyone has had a fantastic night and we raised a record amount. I can’t thank everyone enough for their support in making the event such a success.
