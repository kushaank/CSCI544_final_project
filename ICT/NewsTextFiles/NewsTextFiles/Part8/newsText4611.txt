
Justin Bieber is not known for a lack of confidence.

But the pop 'bad boy' raised the bar yet again in Cannes last night when he took on Hollywood legend Wesley Snipes in a 'rap battle.'

The pair brought the crowd at the exclusive Gotha Club in the French resort to a standstill as they square up for their good-natured contest.

Beebs even did stripped off to his waist for the contest, exposing his extensive range of tattoos.

The clubs was hosting a bash for The Expendables 3 movie cast.

The evening reportedly attracted a huge cast of Hollywood A-listers, including Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Harrison Ford.

Bieber hit the Gotha after reportedly swinging by Bungalow 8 & The Weinstein Company party parties.
