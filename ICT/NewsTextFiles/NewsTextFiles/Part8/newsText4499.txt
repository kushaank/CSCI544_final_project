
Ryan Reynolds' newest film received boos Friday at the Cannes International Film Festival in France.

If only he had an attractive wife to comfort him during his troubled times.

The actor attended the premiere of "The Captive," which Us Weekly subtly referred to as "disastrous." It was so bad, the magazine reported Reynolds didn't show up for the afterparty.

Variety called the film "a ludicrous abduction thriller that finds a once-great filmmaker slipping into previously unentered realms of self-parody," adding the film "was greeted with a smattering of boos" during the Cannes screening.

Those French. They're as bad as the Europeans.

Reynolds and wife Blake Lively instead opted for a "low-key late-night snack," a source told Us Weekly.

Ah, yes ... nothing like 7-11 bagel dogs after midnight.

Actually, the couple was spotted at Hotel Martinez terrace restaurant around 1 A.M., while the rest of "The Captive" cast attended the party.

A source reportedly told Us "Ryan definitely seemed a little on edge. Wouldn't be surprised if he skipped out on his party because the film is getting terrible reviews."

Come on, it's not like Reynolds isn't used to those. He was in "Green Lantern."

Reynolds "seemed preoccupied on his cell phone" while the duo dined at the restaurant but was still "really affectionate" with Lively, the source said.

Well ... duh.

"(It) looked like Blake was trying to cheer him up a few times ... she rubbed his arm like she was consoling him and kept whispering in his ear," the source continues. "At one point, Ryan smiled ... and leaned into her for a kiss on the lips."
