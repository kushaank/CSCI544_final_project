
When Diego Costa burst into tears on the side of the pitch after injury ended his afternoon prematurely and Alexis Sanchez fired Barcelona into the lead on Saturday, the Liga trophy looked to be staying at Camp Nou.

Goal's Alec Fenn said: "With one giant leap and thrust of his forehead, Godin etched his name into Atletico folklore and at last broke Barcelona and Real Madrid's 10-year monopoly over La Liga.

"The Uruguay centre-back has been part of a defence that has leaked just 22 goals all season, with his goal encapsulating the very reason the title will reside at the Vicente Calderon for the next 12 months.

"Barca, for all their attacking talents, have a soft centre. Their defensive vulnerability was undone by the relentless unit assembled by Diego Simeone, who displayed all the spirit and togetherness to hold on that has been lacking at Camp Nou during a season of hierarchial unrest."

Congratulations to Diego Godin, Goal's 262nd World Player of the Week winner!
