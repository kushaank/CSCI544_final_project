
CHEHALIS, Wash. -- Five middle school students and a bus driver needed medical attention Monday morning when a 13-year-old sprayed pepper spray inside a packed bus.

The 46 students were heading from Tumwater to a field trip at Mount St. Helens when one of the students discharged pepper spray inside the bus, according to the Washington State Patrol.

The bus driver, a 28-year-old woman, pulled over to the shoulder of I-5 after she began experiencing breathing problems. Medics and troopers responded to the scene just after 9:30 a.m. and treated five students who had been directly exposed to the spray.

The driver was the only person who went to the hospital for further treatment, according to WSP.

Troopers say the student who discharged the spray handed the container to another student to hide, who then passed it off to yet another student.

Those three kids were taken back to Tumwater and released to school officials. The district dispatched another bus driver and the students continued their field trip.

The incident remains under investigation.

I hope there are some serious, serious consequences for those three miscreants.

So, instead of just one idiot, that kid involved two others? He/she has a promising future.

Should be handled like an assault; 43 counts. Â  Â And to incapacitate a bus driver, driving at highways speeds, is beyond stupid.

@Waif Â You know as well as I do that little will happen to them.

I'm not sure if this angler took any fish home, but he sure landed a prize catch with this sunset at Golden Gardens Beach.
