
LONDON, May 18, (Agencies): Aaron Ramsey insists Arsenal’s dramatic FA Cup final victory will be the springboard for more glory now the Gunners have finally ended their trophy drought. Ramsey scored the extra-time goal that clinched a 3-2 win over Hull in Saturday’s clash at Wembley, putting silverware back in the Arsenal trophy cabinet for the first time since 2005. The Wales midfielder’s cool strike capped a tenacious fightback from Arsene Wenger’s side, who were in danger of suffering another letdown on the big occasion after falling two goals behind in the first eight minutes. Sparked back into life by Santi Cazorla’s brilliant free-kick, the Gunners eventually forced extra-time through Laurent Koscielny’s equaliser before Ramsey settled it in the 109th minute.

While the victory was a cathartic moment for everyone associated with Arsenal, it was especially sweet for Ramsey, who has overcome a series of disappointments to finally prove his worth. For the tens of thousands Arsenal fans lining the streets of north London on Sunday, it had been a long time coming. After nine years spent desperately waiting for a title, they finally got the chance to celebrate the end of the drought as the Gunners paraded the FA Cup on an open-top bus following their comeback victory at Wembley. The team set off from the Emirates Stadium under sunny skies and made its way toward Islington Town Hall, stopping regularly to thank the chanting fans packed on both sides of the route before returning to the club’s home ground.
