
Sweden's Linkoping University held a seminar on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.

Organized by the Council of State Support to Non-Governmental Organizations under the president of Azerbaijan, the event brought together teachers, students and professors at the University, AzerTag news agency reported.

During the event, a video was broadcasted about the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which emerged in 1988 after Armenia's territorial claims against Azerbaijan.

Chairperson of Swedish-Azerbaijani Youth Organization Mahira Mukhtarli provided an insight into the history and consequences of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.

For over two decades, Azerbaijan and Armenia have been locked in the conflict, which impedes the development of the region, as Armenia continues its policy of aggression.

Since a lengthy war in the early 1990s that displaced over one million Azerbaijanis, Armenian armed forces have occupied over 20 percent of Azerbaijan's internationally recognized territory, including Nagorno-Karabakh and seven adjacent regions.

Chairman of the Oslo-Azerbaijan House Ramil Aliyev, Chairman of the Public Union for Scientific and Cultural Relations with Scandinavian countries Nazim Ahmadli said Azerbaijanis living in Nagorno-Karabakh suffer financially and morally from Armenia`s aggressive policy.

The speakers said Armenia continued to disregard the UN Security Council resolutions demanding an unconditional and immediate withdrawal of the Armenian armed forces from Azerbaijan`s occupied lands.

The participants were given books and booklets on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
