
For Louisiana in general -- and Avoyelles in particular -- one thing becomes abundantly clear just by flipping through a phone book. French. A recent gathering to promote tourism in the area included a discussion on how to “cash in” on the state’s French connections. Sheldon Roy, founding president and current president of the Avoyelles CODOFIL chapter, said he came away from that meeting with renewed optimism and determination. CODOFIL stands for the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana.

When first established over 20 years ago, its emphasis was on renewing interest in the French language in the former French colony.

While many in Louisiana may have forgotten the state’s ties to France and French Canada, the Frenchmen’s memories are not so fleeting. “We had more tourists from France and from Canada than any other single countries,” Roy said.

Charles Larroque, CODOFIL’s executive director, recently addressed a gathering concerning the importance and potential of the state’s French traditions in attracting tourists to the state. Roy told The Weekly News that he has corresponded with Larroque concerning that issue and Avoyelles’ possible role in that effort.

He shared a brief email in which Larroque noted the “cultural pride and zeal that was so obvious” at that meeting.

“We would like to make Avoyelles the CODOFIL ‘poster child’ for reinvigorating French in Louisiana,” Larroque wrote. Roy said one suggestion is to get French-speaking elected officials’ support for an effort to introduce French in the public sector -- perhaps with bilingual signage on streets and public buildings. The public would be brought into the effort by noting the impact it would have on tourism in the communities. Roy has fought English-speaking officialdom’s Francophobic ways before -- and prevailed.
