
Welshman Aaron Ramsey's extra-time winner ensured Arsenal ended their nine-year wait for a trophy as they came from two goals behind to beat Hull City at Wembley in the FA Cup final.

Ramsey, from Caerphilly, said the goal was something he had dreamed of for many years and that it was one of the most important goals he had ever scored.
