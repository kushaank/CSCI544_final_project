
Investigators are seeking the cause of death for a high school senior whose body was found in a Houston hotel just hours after she attended prom at the same venue. Police say that the girl's boyfriend had called 911.

Officers took him in for questioning, only to shed light on what happened, but do not believe the boyfriend contributed to the death.Â Police just released that they found alcohol and prescription pain killers in the hotel room, but an autopsy will show exactly what killed her.
