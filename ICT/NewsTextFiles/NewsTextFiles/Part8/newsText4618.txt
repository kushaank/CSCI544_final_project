
CANNES, France - Ivory-skinned, red-head beauty Jessica Chastain looked like an ethereal Roman goddess for the "Foxcatcher" premiere at Cannes in a gown by Elie Saab.

The asymmetrical, one-shoulder, silk couture gown — in on-trend purple — fluttered and turned elemental as the French Riviera wind picked up, showing off the beauty of the delicate ruffles.

Taken from the haute couture spring-summer 2014, Lebanese designer Saab shows he's lost none of his talent with the va-va-voom traffic stoppers. And Chastain worked the carpet — and the wind — with grace.
