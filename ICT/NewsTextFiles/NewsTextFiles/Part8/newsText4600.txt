
Former Prime Minister, Saad Hariri, met Sunday at his Paris residence with Lebanese Forces Party Leader, Samir Geagea, in presence of former PM Fouad Siniora.

In a statement released by Hariri's media bureau following the encounter, it indicated that talks during the meeting, which was continued over lunch and afterwards, tackled the general situation in the country, particularly the pressing issue of the presidential elections.

"Points of view were identical regarding the necessity of holding the presidential elections within the constitutional deadline, refusing any vacuum in this respect. They emphasized the need to exert all necessary efforts and contacts to prevent such presidential vacuum," the statement indicated.

"Emphasis was also made on the need for all members of parliament to participate in the sessions devoted to electing a new President," the statement concluded.

Meanwhile, Sunday sermon in Bkirky saw Maronite Patriarch, Cardinal Beshara Rahi, condemning the possibility of vacuum in the first presidency in case parliament failed to elect a president. He categorically refused to endorse vacuum "even for a day" dubbing it as a "screeching" and "disgraceful" violation of the National Pact and Constitution.

"For our part and for the part of the Lebanese people who are faithful to Lebanon we cannot condone presidential vacuum...as it isolates the essential component of power in Lebanon, namely the Christian component," said the Cardinal as he recalled the unfortunate results of presidential void between the years 1988 and 1990.
