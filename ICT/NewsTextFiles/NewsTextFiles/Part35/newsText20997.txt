A New Florence woman was charged with 2nd degree child endangerment after her son allegedly shot an 11-year-old girl over the weekend.

The girl went to the hospital Sunday after the 14-year-old boy shot her in the throat with a shotgun.

The boy's mother, Norma Davis, was arrested Monday and was out of the Montgomery County Jail on bail.

According to court documents, the boy had access to 4 guns and ammunition at Davis' house.

Those documents said Davis allowed the boy to use the guns, and said she did not know how to operate them to make sure they weren't loaded while they were inside the home.

Davis told authorities she allowed the boy to have a shotgun because she "feels as if it's his job to protect the family."

Davis also told authorities she got a call from his school saying the boy had been having suicidal thoughts. She still allowed him to have access to the weapons, according to those same documents.

ABC 17 News reached out to neighbors in the area Monday.

"[I] didn't really know much what was going on, but she'd been shot," neighborÂ Lewis Cirincione said. "So, you know, I just took it real hard. Yow know, that poor little girl, she's just a sweetheart."

The 14 year-old boy was taken to a juvenile holding facility.

22 areas are now under advisories, watches or severe weather warnings.
