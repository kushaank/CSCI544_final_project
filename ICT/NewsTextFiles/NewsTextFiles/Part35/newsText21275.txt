
Over 40 displaced who were sheltering in the UN base in Bentiu in South Sudan’s Unity state arrived in the contested area of Abyei between Sudan and South Sudan on Sunday afternoon.

The number of people seeking shelter in the UN base reportedly swelled amid tough humanitarian situation, although aid agencies scaled up their response in Unity state.

"The problem in Bentiu town is that there are no transports to the other state, unless you make up your mind,” said Simon, one of the displaced.

He mentioned that “all the tribes” of South Sudan are represented in the camp, including some Equatorians.
