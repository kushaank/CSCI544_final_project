
The Congress of the Republic of Guatemala  on May 13 approved a non-binding resolution denying any existence of genocide during the civil war lasting from 1960-1996. The resolution  calls for national reconciliation and states: "It is legally impossible...that genocide could have occurred in our country's territory during the armed conflict." The Movement of Victims of Northern Quiche  allege that more than 250,000 people were killed during the civil war, predominately Mayan indigenous people. Guatemala's Congress approved the measure with 87 of the 158 members voting in favor, after the secretary general Luis Fernando Pérez  proposed the resolution. Pérez is a legislator for the party founded by ex-dictator Efrain Rios Montt , who was convicted of genocide in May 2013.

In November a Guatemalan court official announced that the genocide trial for Rios Montt would continue in January 2015. The initial conviction was overturned by Guatemala's Constitutional Court .
