
Using passages from the Holy Bible in addition to established legal precedents to make their case, the traditional marriage advocates provide three specific reasons the ruling should be reversed.

In a brief recently filed with the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, a group of legal experts presented a detailed takedown of District Judge Bernard A. Friedman’s decision to strike the Michigan Marriage Amendment. Earlier this year, Friedman effectively legalized same-sex marriage in the state after concluding the amendment is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.

Using passages from the Holy Bible in addition to established legal precedents to make their case, the traditional marriage advocates provide three specific reasons the ruling should be reversed.

The first argument included in the brief refers to Friedman’s reliance on “the shifting sands of social science” in forming his ultimate decision. Though the case at hand reportedly called on the judge to rule simply on a legal issue without making any judgments regarding fact, critics say he relied heavily on the biased testimony of San Francisco psychologist David Brodzinsky.

Friedman reportedly discounted Regnerus based on the fact that he received funding for his research, though he failed to consider the fact that Brodzinsky took in at least $120,000 from homosexual activist groups to further his studies.
