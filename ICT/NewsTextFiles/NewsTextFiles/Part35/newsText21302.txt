
As untiring members of Brigada Eskwela (Bayanihan Para Sa Paaralan) collectively prepare to roll up their sleeves and get down to brass tacks for the School Repair and Renovation Week, the EcoWaste Coalition and the Philippine Association of Paint Manufacturers, Inc. (PAPM) jointly reminded the volunteers to apply lead-safe practices to prevent lead paint chips or dust from spreading as they go about fixing leaking water pipes, repairing broken furniture and windows, and cleaning toilets.

As you probably know, Brigada Eskwela is a volunteer effort that brings together teachers, parents, students, and community members who donate their time and effort and materials (like paint, lumber, and cement) to do minor repairs and clean-ups in their schools. It’s part of the Oplan Balik Eskwela Program and National Maintenance Week of the Department of Education.

On the other hand, EcoWaste Coalition and PAPM are spearheading the ongoing effort to eliminate lead paint in the country in line with the Chemical Control Order for Lead and Lead Compounds issued by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) in December 2013.

•  Keep children and pregnant women out of the work area (lead is very hazardous to unborn children).

• Do not eat, drink or smoke in the work area.

• Use reusable or recyclable containers for volunteers’ beverages and foods.

• Use lead-safe paint for school interiors, exteriors, furniture and fixtures to prevent dispersal of lead dust in the surroundings.

• Opt for safer cleaning agents and avoid hazardous ones such as muriatic acid and dichlorobenzene for cleaning toilets.

• Do not disturb lead painted surfaces in good condition.

•  Cover cracked or deteriorated surfaces with lead-safe paint. Do not dry sand or dry scrape painted surfaces.

• Wet sand or wet scrape if desired or needed.  Use a spray bottle or wet sponge to keep the surface damp and the airborne dust levels low.

• Work clean: Create as little dust as possible, clean up thoroughly, and dispose of paint waste properly.

• Thoroughly wash hands with soap and water after any repainting work.

• After a repainting job, change clothes before going home, set aside in a sealed reusable bag and wash separately.

• Keep the Brigada Eskwela’s residual trash to the minimum.

•  Turn bio-waste, such as grasses, leaves, and twigs, into compost and reuse and recycle the rest.
