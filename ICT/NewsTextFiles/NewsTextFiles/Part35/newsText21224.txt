
Interior Minister Nouhad al-Mashnouq hoped on Monday that Emirati nationals would once again return to Lebanon “after stability in the country has been restored” due to the implementation of the government's security plan.

“I am optimistic however that my visit will pave the way for better ties between Lebanon and the UAE,” he added.

“The visit will help restore the trust and economic ties between the two sides,” noted the minister after holding talks with his Emirati counterpart Sheikh Seif bin Zayed al-Nahyan.

He also cited Saudi Arabia's recent encouragement of its citizens to travel to Lebanon as a sign that the advisory may be lifted.

Mashnouq traveled to the UAE on Sunday, the first stop of a tour of the Arab Gulf ahead of an expected decision by the Gulf Cooperation Council to lift a travel advisory to Lebanon.

The deterioration of the security situation in Lebanon in light of the developments in Syria in recent months prompted the Gulf states of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar to issue the advisories.

Media reports said last week that Saudi Arabia is likely to lift its travel ban at the end of May.

The report came in light of the return of Saudi Ambassador to Lebanon Ali Awadh Asiri to the country with his family on May 2 to resume his diplomatic duties.

The Saudi diplomat stated upon his arrival in Beirut that there is no ban on visits by Saudi nationals to Lebanon.
