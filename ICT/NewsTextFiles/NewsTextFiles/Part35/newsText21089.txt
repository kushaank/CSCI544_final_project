
The Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin) has urged the newly appointed Coordinating Economic Minister Chairul Tanjung to maintain price stability and the country’s economic growth during his five-month term.

"Five months is a short period of time for a minister to do his job. But, economic growth and a conducive investment environment have to be maintained," Kadin chairman Suryo Bambang Sulisto said in Jakarta on Monday, as quoted by kontan.co.id.

He said that economic stability was particularly crucial during the cabinet transition.
