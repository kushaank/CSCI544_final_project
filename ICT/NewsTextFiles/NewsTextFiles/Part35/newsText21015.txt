
DRAPER, Utah — A man involved in a 7-vehicle accident in Draper that resulted in the death of one woman was charged Monday.

The accident occurred at approximately 6:30 p.m. at the intersection of 12300 South and Lone Peak Parkway on May 8. Susan Madsen, 43, of Draper, was killed, her daughter was seriously injured and four otherpeople were transported to hospitals with minor injuries.

According to a press release from Draper City Police Department the man who caused the accident was Bill Robert Thompson, 44, of Draper.

Thompson has been charged with murder; two counts of aggravated assault; eight counts of driving under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol; two counts of assault; two counts of commission of domestic violence in the presence of a child.

Court documents state Thompson was involved in an altercation with his roommate prior to the fatal accident.  It states that Thompson hit the roommate several times in the face with an open hand while the roommate was holding Thompson’s 3-year-old son.

A neighbor stated that the argument was because the defendant had been drinking for the last couple of days and was very intoxicated.

Police received a call about domestic violence but Thompson had already left the scene before officers arrived.

Prior to the fatal accident, Thompson was involved in an accident on Pony Express Road, according to court documents.

The driver of a Mini Cooper came to the dead end of the road and tried to let Thompson pass her to make a U-turn — instead Thompson reportedly struck the driver’s side door then laughed and drove off.

The fatal accident at the intersection of 12300 South and Lone Peak Parkway happened soon after that.
