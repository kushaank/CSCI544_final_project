
The Packard name isnâ€™t fading away â€” the hospital itself will still be named after the philanthropist and wife of Hewlett Packard Co. co-founder David Packard. But the new Stanford Childrenâ€™s Health moniker will apply to the expanding network of the Palo Alto-based childrenâ€™s health-care service provider.

Stanford Childrenâ€™s Health will cover 64 Bay Area locations. That includes pediatric centers run with partners CPMC and John Muir Health.

Services are currently available at more than 100 locations in eight states, the health system said. It serves nearly 400,000 patient visits a year, making it the largest childrenâ€™s and womenâ€™s health network in Northern California.

In addition to the rebrand, the hospital is expanding its footprint. In April, it bought an 80,000-square-foot building in Sunnyvale , and a few months previously, it picked up a 63,000-square-foot medical office building on the Campbell/Los Gatos border. It also has plans for an additional East Bay location.

The move reflects both the Bay Area's growing pediatrics and obstetrics market, as well as a need to provide services closer to where patients live.

Stanford Childrenâ€™s Health is also expanding the Lucile Packard Hospital. A 521,000-square-foot expansion will open in 2017, taking the number of beds from 311 to more than 400.
