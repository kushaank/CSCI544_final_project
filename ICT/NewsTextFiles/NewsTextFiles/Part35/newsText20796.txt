
HARIDWAR: As the country gave a clear mandate to BJP, yoga guru Ramdev returned to his ashram, Patanjali Yogapeet, here after serving his self-imposed exile of about nine months, on Monday. He had declared in September that he would return only after a government led by Narendra Modi would replace the UPA.

The yoga guru reached Narsan on the Delhi-Haridwar highway around 1 p.m. But it took him about three hours to reach the city as he was welcomed by enthusiastic crowds on the way.

As he arrived at Rishikul grounds, he was accorded a rousing reception by thousands of his disciples.

After addressing the gathering there , he left for Har-ki-Pauri, where he performed Ganga puja and participated in the evening aarati.

Speaking on his 'Bharat Swabhiman Yatra', he said, "Not a single day passed without a bad news for us. But the truth has ultimately triumphed." During the yatra, he claimed to have travelled 14 lakh kilometers mostly by road, addressed around 15 crore people across the country and held about 11000 meetings and camps.

Ramdev recalled that he had declared Narendra Modi to be the country's future prime minister even before BJP anointed him as its chairman of the Lok Sabha polls campaign committee. He even claimed that he wanted BJP to declare Modi as its PM pick as a pre-condition for his support to the saffron party.

Earlier at an event at Patanjali Yogapeeth on April 26, prominent saints from across the country had hailed Modi as the fittest candidate for the PM post. Subsequently, Ramdev appealed BJP to announce Modi as its PM pick on September 7. The party declared Modi as its PM nominee on September 13.
