
Even before the Narendra Modi government is to be formed at the Centre the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi has queered the pitch for reviewing the Indo-Sri Lankan policy to render justice to the Sri Lankan Tamils.

VCK president Thol. Thirumavalavan made this observation in a statement released here on Sunday in remembrance of the fifth anniversary of the Mullivaikkal genocide in which several innocent Tamils were massacred by the Sri Lankan forces on May 18, 2009.

Mr. Thirumavalavan categorically stated that “only the formation of Tamil Eelam would provide solution to the Sri Lankan Tamils’ issue as they continue to suffer in the hands of the Sri Lankan military.” He also called upon the new government to be formed to prevail upon the United Nations to conduct, under its supervision, a referendum on the formation of Tamil Eelam.

Mr. Thirumavalavan noted that heeding the international opinion the United Nations Human Rights Commission had decided to conduct an independent probe into the atrocities committed by the Sri Lankan government against the Tamil race.

Such a measure had instilled hope among the Tamil diaspora and the human rights activists that those who perpetrated the “war crimes” would be identified and duly punished. He pointed out that besides not showing any sign of remorse on the genocide the Sri Lankan government was going ahead to ban Tamil organisations abroad by painting them as terrorist outfits.

He blamed the outgoing Congress-led United Progressive government for supporting the moves of the Sri Lanka in this regard. Therefore, he urged the new government at Centre to act in a proactive manner to render justice to the Sri Lankan Tamils.
