SUMTER, S.C. (AP) - It’s not the traditional approach, but it does have fans.

For the last year, Sumter OB-GYN has been offering CenteringPregnancy.

Group meetings start after the traditional visit around the 10-to-12-weeks mark. If you’re a candidate and choose Centering, you’ll meet with up to 11 other women due to deliver within a month of your date until about the 36-weeks mark, Whitaker said. Then you will return to the private setting until you deliver and return for a celebration after the babies are born.

“This is when the physician measures the woman’s belly and listens to fetal heart tones,” Whitaker said.

While over there, a board is set up for the women to write any questions they don’t feel comfortable asking out loud. Then they circle up to go over educational material.

Seven women who recently met talked about gifts they’d received and recommended shopping sites to each other. They discussed baby’s movement pattern and started talking about what to do after the baby comes.

Kelliann Wineski is expecting her first child and was hesitant to sign up for the program.

Dominique Bellamy is having her second child, and she loved the class, too.

Rose Bridges came to support her daughter, Marissa Tindal, who is having her first child.
