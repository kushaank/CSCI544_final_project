
A bill that would make it legal for concealed carry holders to store handguns inside a locked vehicle in school parking lots passed the Oklahoma House by a 83-6 vote Thursday.

Currently it is illegal in the Sooner State to have a firearm on school grounds under threat of a felony offense, so state lawmakers are looking to change that for permitted carriers with  House Bill 2614 .

“We are a very pro-Second Amendment state. We’re a very pro-self-defense state. We don’t need to create unnecessary barriers for people to protect themselves,” explained Treat.

HB2614 would further drop the penalty for violating the state’s handgun regulations to that of a misdemeanor crime subject with a maximum $250 fine.

Although popular, a few lawmakers did come out in opposition to the legislation.

The National Rifle Association as well as several state level gun rights groups support the measure.

This year alone both Tennessee and Indiana have signed legislation that expand gun rights to include school parking lots. West Virginia’s state Senate in March passed a bill to allow guns in municipal public parking lots if their vehicles are locked and the firearm is out of view.

Oklahoma’s bill has been transmitted to the state Senate where it is expected to pass and soon be sent to the desk of Gov. Mary Fallin.
