
INDORE: A  nurse posted at the Chacha Nehru Hospital has lodged a workplace harassment complaint against hospital administration with the divisional commissioner Sanjay Dube. The copy of complaint has also been sent to State Women Commission and  MP Human Rights Commission.

Nisha Gupta has leveled allegations of uneven duty hours given to her. "I have been harassed by the hospital staff since long. Fed up with their atrocities, I have finally written to divisional commissioner. There are no fixed duty hours in the hospital," said Gupta. She further said that the hospital administration gave her transfer orders when election code is effective.

On the other hand, hospital superintendent Dr  Sharad Thora said, "Gupta has been posted to  MY Hospital. It is an internal reshuffle and not a transfer. The decision was taken after recommendations of a committee which was constituted by the dean of  Mahatma Gandhi Medical College (MGMC) to look into her complaints."

Earlier, Gupta had lodged a complaint with MGMC dean Dr  Pushpa Verma against the hospital administration.
