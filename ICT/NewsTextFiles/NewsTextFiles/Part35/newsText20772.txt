Greece’s main opposition party Syriza is celebrating after recording a historic first in local elections.

The radical anti-austerity group fared strongly, making it into the second round of the contest for Athens and the surrounding region, for the first time ever.

Its supporters believe the result is a taste of things to come in this week’s European Parliament vote.

“Syriza is our hope, our only hope if we are to take back what was taken away from us,” said one woman at a party rally.

Critics say Syriza’s strategy of casting the local and EU elections as a referendum on the ruling coalition’s austerity policies is paying dividends.

Our correspondent in Athens says even though the two ruling coalition parties fared well in the remaining 12 regions, Syriza’s showing is very significant.

“For the first time in Greek politics, a party to the left of the socialists appears close to winning in the European parliament and possibly even the national elections.” says Stamatis Giannis.
