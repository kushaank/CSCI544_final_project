
Addis Ababa, 19 May 2014: The Chairperson of the Commission of the African Union (AU), Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, wishes to recall her statement of 7 April 2014, through which she commended Sudan for commencing preparations on the comprehensive and holistic national dialogue amongst the Sudanese stakeholders. Through that statement, she further congratulated all the Sudanese political parties that took part in the meeting held on 6 April 2014, for their constructive and candid inputs which will guide the national dialogue process and help focus the work of the various committees to be established.

Furthermore, the Chairperson of the Commission is very encouraged by the recent visit of the AU High-Level Implementation Panel (AUHIP), during which extensive exchanges of views on the National Dialogue took place with a broad spectrum of political parties and civil society organizations, including the National Congress Party (NCP). These interactions were greatly appreciated by the Sudanese interlocutors as they facilitated a deeper understanding of the best approach to ensure a successful National Dialogue.

The Chairperson of the Commission underscores the importance of the National Dialogue process for the future of Sudan, and appeals to all the parties concerned to desist from any actions that could undermine its smooth conduct. In this regard, she wishes to express serious concern over the recent developments in Sudan as these have the potential of negatively impacting on the National Dialogue Process.
