
Russian LifeNews journalists being held captive by Ukraine's coup-installed government were reportedly arrested after they released footage showing a UN-marked helicopter used by Kievâ€™s armed forces engaged in an operation against civilians in the east.

A few days prior to the journalistsâ€™ arrest on Sunday, the   authorities in Kiev issued an order to â€œfind and   neutralizeâ€� Oleg Sidyakin and Marat Saichenko, a LifeNews   source in the Ukrainian Security Forces (SBU) told the channel.

The order to arrest the LifeNews crew was reportedly given   immediately after the release of the channel's video of a   UN-marked Mil Mi-24 strike helicopter being used by the Ukrainian   army in a military operation in the eastern regions.

â€œThe incident was discussed at the highest level. [SBU] was   instructed to find the authors [of the footage] and to do   everything not to allow them to work in those areas where the   National Guard is deployed,â€� LifeNews quoted the source as   saying.

At the time of the initial release of the footage , which has made waves around the   world, LifeNews said at least three combat Mi-24 and one   transport Mi-8 helicopters carrying UN logos were spotted by   their crew while covering Kievâ€™s military operation in the   Donetsk region, near Kramatorsk.

The UN has demanded an explanation from Kiev as to why UN-labeled   military hardware was used in a non-authorized mission. So far   the Ukrainian side has failed to provide such details.

â€œIt is the responsibility of Troop Contributing Countries   (TCCs) that provide Contingent Owned Equipment to peacekeeping   missions to remove all logos and signage bearing the UN's name   once such equipment has been repatriated to the home country or   is no longer being used for official UN purposes,â€� the   office told RT last week.

Meanwhile, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in   Europe (OSCE) has urged Kiev authorities to release the Russian journalists.

The detained journalists, Oleg Sidyakin and Marat Saichenko, are   being investigated on charges of â€œaiding terrorist   groups,â€� deputy secretary of Ukraineâ€™s National Security and   Defense Council (SNBO), Victoria Sumar, wrote on her Facebook   page.

Video footage of the brutal arrest and treatment of the LifeNews   crew has been released, along with a close-up of documents, some   journalistic equipment, and a pile of Russian and Ukrainian   currency alongside a man-portable air-defense system (MANPAD)   with inscriptions in Polish. A third man shown kneeling on the   ground was not identified.

The Ukrainian Security Service said that two Russian citizens   detained in the Donetsk region with video equipment have been   brought to Kiev for interrogation.
