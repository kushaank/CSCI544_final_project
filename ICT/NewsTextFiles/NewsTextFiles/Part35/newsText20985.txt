
Hip surgery conducted with a 3D printed titanium implant and bone stem cell graft has been conducted in Southampton.

According to Southampton University, the implant will provide a new socket for the ball of the femur bone to enter. Doctors have also inserted a graft containing bone stem cells behind the implant and between the pelvis .

The graft is said to acts as a filler for the loss of bone, with the patient’s own bone marrow cells added to the graft to provide a source of bone stem cells to encourage bone regeneration behind and around the implant.

Over the past decade Dunlop and Prof Richard Oreffo, at Southampton University, have developed a translational research programme to drive bone formation using patient skeletal stem cells in orthopaedics.

The graft used in the operation is made up of a bone scaffold that allows blood to flow through it. Stem cells from the bone marrow will attach to the material and grow new bone, which will support the 3D printed hip implant.

In a statement, Prof Oreffo said: ‘The 3D printing of the implant in titanium, from CT scans of the patient and stem cell graft is cutting edge and offers the possibility of improved outcomes for patients.

The patient, Meryl Richards from Hampshire, was involved in a traffic accident in 1977 and has since undergone six hip operations.
