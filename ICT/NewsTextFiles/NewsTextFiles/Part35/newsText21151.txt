
Ireland?s 13,000 garda? are entitled to be part of national pay talks and to strike, doing away with the need for bouts of "blue-flu".

Forbidden since their foundation to strike, the Association of Garda Inspectors and Sergeants (AGSI) took a case to the Council of Europe, complaining that their rights under the European Social Charter were being abused.

The Committee which oversees the Charter agreed with most of their case, which was taken on their behalf by EuroCOP, the umbrella body that represents EU police forces.

The win by the 2,000-strong AGSI will also apply to the Garda Representative Association. The Department of Justice was considering the decision.

Last year, when they threatened to withdraw from the Croke Park 2 deal, they won the right to go to the Labour Relations Court, which was a breakthrough. But they were unclear whether this set a permanent precedent or not.

The GRA in the past applied pressure through bouts of ?blue-flu? where large numbers of their members took sick leave simultaneously. Freedom to strike would do away with this.

The garda? lost their bid to be allowed become a trade union with the finding that their associations were tantamount to a union. However, they were told they should have the right to affiliate to trade union groups, such as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.

Esther Lynch, ICTU legal affairs officer, said the ruling sets the record straight on the assumption that international law requires countries to ban their police taking part in trade union action.
