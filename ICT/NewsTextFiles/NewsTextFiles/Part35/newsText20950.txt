"The new area offers a state-of-the-art room for our victim advocates and forensic nurse examiners to provide expert care to sexual assault victims," said Margaret Bach, president/CEO of Child and Family Services of Saginaw.

"This partnership opens the door for sexual assault victims to receive a continuum of care including counseling, legal advocacy and crisis intervention free of charge from the Sexual Assault Center of Child and Family Services."

The area will be used by local agencies providing sexual assault services such as Child and Family Services, the Child Abuse and Neglect Council and other members of the Sexual Assault Response Team, a multidisciplinary and inter-agency team of individuals who work to provide services for the community by offering specialized sexual assault intervention services, according to hospital officials.

"The Sexual Assault Center of Child and Family Services is overjoyed with Covenant HealthCare's passion and commitment to victims of sexual assault," Bach said.

Every August, the Covenant HealthCare Foundation hosts a series of Red Carpet events to raise funds for a cause. A portion of the money raised at Red Carpet 2013 was used to purchase a colposcope, an advanced photo and video tool used in examinations, for the victim support area.
