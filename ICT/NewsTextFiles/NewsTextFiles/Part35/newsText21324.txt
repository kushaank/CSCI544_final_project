
Somaliland  is a self-declared independent state internationally recognised as an autonomous region of Somalia.

In 1988, the Siad Barre regime committed massacres against the people of Somaliland, which were among the events that led to the Somali Civil War. In 1991, the local government declared independence from the rest of Somalia.

Somaliland's self-proclaimed independence, however, remains unrecognised by any country or international organisation.

Lib Dem deputy leader Councillor Christian Martin (Clifton East), who spoke to campaigners at an evening function, said: "There has been 25 years of peace and people have their own currency, passports and government.

"If they had international recognition they could apply to NATO for funding, which would offer further security for their country."
