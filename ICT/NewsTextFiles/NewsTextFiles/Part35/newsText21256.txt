
MOSCOW, May 19. /ITAR-TASS/. Russia will seek an international investigation into the tragedy in Odessa, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said.

Letters to this effect have been sent to the UN and OSCE, Lavrov said after talks with Slovak counterpart Miroslav Lajcak on Monday.

“Russia is indignant with the Kiev authorities’ attitude towards the tragedy in Odessa and the attempts to lie about the events,” he said.

“We cannot take the role of a court. But the investigation, organized by the Verkhovna Rada, cannot satisfy us,” Lavrov said.

“We will insist the investigation be objective, impartial and complete,” he said.
