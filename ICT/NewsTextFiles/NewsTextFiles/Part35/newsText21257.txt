
UNITED NATIONS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary General Ban Ki- moon on Monday welcomed the announcement of preliminary results of parliamentary election in Iraq, and looked forward to the final tally and subsequent timely formation of a new government.

A statement issued by his spokesperson said Ban "looks forward to the certification of the final results after all procedures have been completed, including the adjudication of possible appeals."

Final vote tally released Monday for Iraq's April 30 nationwide parliamentary elections showed a strong lead by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's bloc, raising his chances to remain on the post for a third term despite fierce opposition and worsening security.

"The Secretary-General urges all political parties to engage constructively and in a timely manner in the process of government formation," it said.

According to the statement, the Secretary-General was also concerned about the security situation in Anbar province. Ban urged the Iraqi government to ensure that military operations against terrorism are conducted in accordance with the country's international and constitutional human rights obligations.

Fighting in Anbar in recent months between Iraqi troops and al- Qaeda-affiliated fighters has caused hundreds of thousands of people to become displaced, many of whom are residing in schools, mosques and other public buildings and are in need of various humanitarian items.
