Nurses have informed MUMN that through social network, one particular patient cyber bullied nurses working in a particular unit at Mater Dei Hospital, a union statement said this morning.

While nurses go out of their way to see to the needs of their patients, offensive remarks are being expressed on a particular social network, ridiculing such a noble profession in an attempt to lower the dignity of the nurses concerned.

MUMN is sure that the public appreciates greatly the work and service that nurses and midwives carry out in all hospitals including health centres. Cyber bullying is only a cowardly form of bullying since patients and relatives have an official channel to voice all possible concerns through customer care which is present in all hospitals including SVPR.

While MUMN condemns such an isolated incident of cyber bulling, it appeals to all nurses and midwives to ignore such form of bullying and continue to provide the best service possible to all our patients.
