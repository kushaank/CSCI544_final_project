Many houses and agricultural lands are affected negatively due to the heavy rainfall in Obrenovac, Serbia on May 18, 2014.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia (AP) - Officials say landslides triggered by record-high floods have left hundreds of people homeless in Bosnia, while thousands more are fleeing their homes in Croatia and Serbia as Balkan countries battle the region's worst flooding in recorded history.

Throughout hilly Bosnia, floods caused by four days of heavy rainfall last week are triggering landslides covering roads, homes and whole villages. Bosnia's refugee minister, Adil Osmanovic, said Sunday that the country is facing catastrophe.

In the east of neighboring Croatia, two people are missing and hundreds have fled their homes as the Sava River breached flood barriers. In Serbia, more than 20,000 people have been forced from their homes. Officials there fear more flooding later Sunday as rivers swell at high tide.

At least 35 people have died in the Balkan floods.
