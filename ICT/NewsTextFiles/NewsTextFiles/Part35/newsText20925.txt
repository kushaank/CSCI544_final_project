A 10-year-old girl has told US authorities that she was raped by an eight-year-old boy while his sister held her down.

The alleged assault took place in the bathrooms of the Edgemere Elementary School in Oklahoma City.

The girl's mother told police her daughter came running out of the school in tears, crying: "Mama, they touched me down there."

The alleged victim said she was in the bathroom when the siblings concerned her. The little boy allegedly pulled down his pants and then took off the girls clothes while his sister held her down.

A rape exam carried out on the girl at a local hospital confirmed her wounds were consistent with sexual assault.

"I'm not blaming the kids, I blame the teachers that are supposed to protect our kids when they're at school," the mother told local TV station KFOR .

The Oklahoma City School District says they notified the Police Department immediately after hearing about the alleged sexual assault.
