“The Trust disburses the amount to the hospital to fund a patient’s treatment. The Hindu Every week, we help more than two people towards their medical treatment. Till date, we have funded over 250 patients,” says Srimathy.

Friends and relatives are the major contributors of the trust, she added.

My husband’s brother V. Mani runs an orphanage in Bangalore ‘SO CARE IND’ for children of life-convicts.

The orphanage funds the children’s education and looks after their well-being.

He advised me to start a Trust to help the poor and his work has been an inspiration to me, she adds.

“It is society which is responsible for our growth and what we are today. We should contribute to society in the little ways that we can.

If you have the will to help, you can.
