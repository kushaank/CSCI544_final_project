
ButÂ The Italian embassy on Monday advised Italians in Libya to consider temporarily coming home following recent political violence in the capital Tripoli. On Sunday renegade anti-Islamist troops stormed the interim parliament and suspended the Islamist-dominated House, accusing it of empowering extremists. At least two people were reported killed and 66 hurt in ensuing violence, some of the worst since the 2011 uprising that ousted strongman Muammar Gaddafi.

Giuseppe Buccino Grimaldi, Italian Ambassador to Libya, spoke about Sunday's siege of Libyan parliament calling the situation "complex" and a "crossroads". "The situation is complex, today better than yesterday, it seems to be back to some normality but we have to monitor the situation closely in keeping us in contact with our fellow citizens", said Grimaldi to Skytg24, denying rumors that some entrepreneurs remained stuck in a hotel. "The country is at a crossroads", the Ambassador added, "on the one hand there is a strong and democratic Libya and the other, chaos", making it necessary to understand in which direction it will go. But, Grimaldi added, "we have not lost hope" that it can still go in the first direction.
