UNWTO is deeply saddened by the news of the devastating floods currently affecting Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia. On behalf of the international tourism community, UNWTO conveys its heartfelt sympathy to the affected communities and to the governments of the three countries.

UNWTO is confident that the area will recover from this tragic occurrence and stands ready and committed to support the national authorities in any tourism-related recovery programs for the affected areas in order to ensure that tourism continues to thrive and contribute to the region’s future socio-economic development.
