Two children seriously injured in a crash at Te Puna that killed their 26-year-old mother are being transferred to Tauranga Hospital this afternoon.

Tracey's children three-year-old Faith and four-year-old brother Phoenix, seriously injured in the Te Puna crash are being transferred to Tauranga Hospital this afternoon.

Tracey O'Brien's three-year-old daughter Faith and four-year-old son Phoenix were flown to Auckland's Starship Children's Hospital with serious injuries after the crash on State Highway 2 at Loop Road on May 3.

Early indications from police preliminary results show Tracey was using a mobile phone and not wearing her seatbelt when her car crossed the centreline and collided with a north-bound peoplemover outside Charlemagne Lodge.

A Starship Children's Health media communications spokesperson says the children are both in a stable condition.

They are expected to be transferred by ambulance from Starship in the Auckland suburb of Grafton to Tauranga Hospital to continue recovering.

Tauranga Hospital communications advisor James Fuller told SunLive at 2pm the children had not yet arrived.

Faith suffered a broken leg in the crash, while her brother had more extensive injuries including a broken pelvis, legs and arm. It is reported that 75 per cent of his body is in a cast.

Tracey was farewelled in a funeral service last Monday.
