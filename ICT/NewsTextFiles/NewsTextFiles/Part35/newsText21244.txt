
South Sudan president warns of 'worst famine ever'

Up to 7.3 million people could starve by August unless the fighting stops between government forces and rebels loyal to sacked vice-president Riek Machar.

South Sudan president Salva Kiir has said that the ongoing domestic conflict between government forces and rebels loyal to sacked vice-president Riek Machar could lead to his country suffering one of the worst famines ever.

While peace talks between the two camps continue, Kiir has accused Machar's forces of breaking the recent ceasefire deal and has delayed scheduled elections due for 2015 to allow more time for negotiations.

Speaking to BBC's Hardtalk, Kiir blamed Machar's forces for the famine, calling it a "man-made disaster."

"If Riek Machar was to understand that the civilian population is going to face one of the worst famines there has ever been, this is the time," he said.

The UN has already warned that 7.3 million people could starve by August unless the fighting stops. Up to a million have already fled their homes in battles that have claimed the lives of thousands.

Kiir has also asked for a further $1.2 billion in aid to avoid the predicted famine. In addition to a food crisis, South Sudan is also dealing with an outbreak of cholera.
