
Acute care accounts for more than $370 billion, or 29 percent of annual healthcare costs1 in the U.S. As telehealth programs incorporating Philips technology continue to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes in critical care and in the home , hospitals are increasingly realizing the value and impact of telehealth across medical and surgical units.

"While eCareManager is a critical piece of our offering, delivering higher standards of care requires more than technology alone," said Derek Smith, CEO of Philips Hospital to Home. "Working with our customers, the insights we're able to derive from our patient-centric approach to telehealth result in vast improvements in outcomes and cost savings for hospitals and health systems alike."

"Continuous patient surveillance across the care continuum, partnered with Philips Hospital to Home tools and a telehealth team, can improve patient outcomes and reduce costs," said Julie Reisetter, RN, MS, Chief Nursing Officer, Banner Telehealth. "We're excited to see the results of our early collaboration with the Philips Hospital to Home team with the release of eCareManager 4.0."

St. Louis, MO-based Mercy also recently went live with the eAcute program . Its initial goals are to reduce readmissions and lengths of stay, while increasing patient safety and satisfaction.

"Telehealth is proving to be a powerful approach to providing our patients with the best possible care, and enabling our care teams the support necessary to make faster and more informed clinical decisions," said Wendy Deibert, RN, BSN, vice president, Mercy Telehealth Services. "Philips Hospital to Home has been a valued partner as we've rolled out these efforts from the ICU to the home, and now to our medical and surgical units."
