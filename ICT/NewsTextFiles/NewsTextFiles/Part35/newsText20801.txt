
For one hospital in eastern China, pristine white nursing uniforms were simply    not glamorous enough.

So earlier this month, a pilot group of 12 nurses at the Lianshui Traditional    Chinese Medicine hospital in the city of Huai'an began coming to work    dressed as airline stewardesses.

"If you think of all the professions in the world, which one comes to mind    when you think of good customer service?" asked Bu Haijuan, the head of the    hospital's nursing unit. "It's airline stewardesses isn't it?"

Ms Bu dreamed up the idea to remind her nurses to improve their bedside manner    and dismissed the suggestion that it might be demeaning for trained medical    professionals to don the equivalent of a fancy dress costume.

"Nurses learn all sorts of technical skills at college but customer service    can be easily overlooked," insisted Ms Bu. "But flight attendants are    specifically trained to have a good attitude and manners."

So far, the hospital's scheme is voluntary and confined to one ward, but    carries with it a higher salary. The nurses taking part were trained for a    month by an actual stewardess from China Eastern Airlines.

The hospital said the new uniforms have slightly longer skirts, "for reasons    everyone understands".

One nurse, 23-year-old Zhao Yanan, told the Yangtse Evening Post that she was    enthusiastic about her new uniform and that she has started going to bed    earlier so that she looks prettier in the morning.

"Cooks can wear white uniforms. Butchers can wear white uniforms. There is no    regulation saying that nurses have to wear white," said Ms Bu. "We should    think outside the box. We are trying to make the best use of our resources    to improve our customer service."
