UNICEF in South Sudan has urgently appealed for US$10m to continue increase its cholera prevention work and carry on with its operations in the country.

The appeals comes in the wake of rising caseload of cholera in South Sudan. “The deadly, highly contagious disease appears to be spreading,” said UNICEF on Monday.

Since the outbreak of cholera in the capital, Juba, late last week, the reported cholera caseload has doubled every day; now with new reported cases in two additional states, Jonglei and Upper Nile.

After the first case was confirmed in Juba four days ago, more than 130 additional cases are now being treated. There are three confirmed deaths. Dozens of children are among the affected.

Since January, UNICEF has warned of the threat of cholera, due to the desperate overcrowding of camps following continued violence, and now the rainy season.  Last month the UN Children’s Fund said that unless nutrition treatment is scaled up immediately, up to 50,000 children under the age of five are likely to die.

In response to the cholera outbreak, UNICEF has helped establish a Cholera Treatment Centre (CTC) at the Juba Teaching Hospital, together with the provision of life-saving supplies – including medicines, protective gear, and equipment, and is expanding preventive measures to halt further spread across the country.
