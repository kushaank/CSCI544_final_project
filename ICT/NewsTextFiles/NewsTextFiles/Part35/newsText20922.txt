
Ms Rosemary Namubiru, the nurse who is accused of pricking a baby with a cannula that had pricked her hand, well knowing that she was HIV positive, has been found guilty of professional negligence under section 171 of the penal code.

Buganda Road Chief magistrate Ms Olive Kazaarwe who is yet to pronounce a sentence stated that:  "The fact that the suspect was not able to tell court as to whether she used the same cannula or not is enough to prove that she knew what she was doing"

Ms Namubiru was subjected to a medical test, whose results indicated she was in possession of all her mental faculties by the time she committed the crime.

Section 171 of the penal code states that “any person who unlawfully or negligently does any act which is and which he or she knows or has reason to believe to be likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life commits an offence and is liable to imprisonment for up to seven years”.

The Buganda Road Chief  magistrate Ms Olive Kazaarwe has sentenced Ms Rosemary Namubiru to three years in prison.
