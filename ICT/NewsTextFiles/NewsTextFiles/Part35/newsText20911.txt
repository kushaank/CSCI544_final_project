
Patients and visitors at the Korle-bu Teaching hospitals are complaining about the frequent breakdown of elevators at the maternity block of the institution.

 One of the two lifts is said to have broken down causing lots of inconvenience to patients, especially pregnant women and visitors.

That has mounted enormous pressure on the efficient one, with everybody queuing to use it.

 One of the visitors told Joy News' Michaela Anderson the situation has become deplorable.

"The lift is not working ,it’s only one. It’s makes it very difficult for us to go to the fourth, fifth and sixth floors.

“There is so much pressure on the one that is working. It makes movement very slow."

"There is some old women who like to go to the third, fourth and fifth floor  and you know this old ladies they can’t walk and the security will not allow them to use the lift.

"It makes visitation and other stuff very tough,” she explained.

In a reaction, Mustapha Salifu, the Public Relations Officer of the institution is optimistic that the broken down lift will be fixed on Monday to diffuse the pressure on the efficient one.
