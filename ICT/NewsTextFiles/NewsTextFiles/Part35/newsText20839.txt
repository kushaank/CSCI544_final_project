NURSES from Moree celebrated International Nurses Day last week with a healthy lunch.

Health service manager, Bronwyn Cosh, said International Nurses Day  was an important opportunity to recognise and celebrate the significant contribution made by the largest single group of employees in Hunter New England Local Health District’s workforce.

"The hospital would like to acknowledge the hard work of the nurses and thank them for the excellent care they provide to the local community," Ms Cosh said.

International Nurses Day is celebrated each year on May 12, the birthday of the founder of modern nursing, Florence Nightingale.

They work across the continuum of care – in primary and community care and in hospitals; in rural and metropolitan settings providing care to patients, families and communities.

And they work across the continuum of life – from delivering ante-natal care to providing palliative care at the end of life.

Ms Cosh said the healthy spread enjoyed by nurses on Monday was part of Moree District Health Service’s effort to improve the health and wellbeing of all of its staff.

 “A staff health day was recently held where staff could have their blood glucose, blood pressure and weight measured and on Thursday afternoons a physio is running an exercise class for staff,” Ms Cosh said.
