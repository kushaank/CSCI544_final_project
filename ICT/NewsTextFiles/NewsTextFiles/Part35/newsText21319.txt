
Senate President David Mark on Monday urged West African countries to continue to unite in their efforts toward combating terrorism in the region.

Mark made the call at the opening of first 2014 Ordinary Session of the ECOWAS Parliament in Abuja.

“We have to understand that it is our collective mandate to ensure that the West African sub region, renowned for her unity, co-operation, brotherly love and peaceful coexistence, continues to maintain and improve on this.

“Terrorism and insurgency are alien to our culture. We must therefore stand united against it in all ramifications.

“I urge the ECOWAS Parliament to be the activist in promoting regional peace.

“You, by the nature of your schedule must legislate for the present  and its dangers but must also exercise wisdom and sagacity in projecting this legislation into the future,’’ he said.

The Senate President reminded the parliamentarians that the security challenges required fortification of democratic institutions if the region must overcome.

Mark also pointed out the need for Africa to continue to seek regional and international collaboration in the fight against crimes which he described as transnational.

Mark commended the Presidents of France, Cameroun, Niger, Chad, Benin and Nigeria for convening a regional security summit in Paris that sought to chart a way forward.

Earlier, President of ECOWAS Commission, Mr Kadre Ouedraogo said that the challenge of a more inclusive, peaceful and integrated region required greater coordinated measures to combat threats of terrorism and organised crimes.

Represented by Mr McIntosh Toga, ECOWAS Vice President, Ouedraogo said that types of responses to be considered in the long term required special attention to socio-economic development.
