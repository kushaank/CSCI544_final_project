Indianapolis-based Cornerstone Cos. Inc. is working on plans for an $11 million medical office building near St. Vincent                               and IU Health hospitals in Fishers.

The developer—which builds, leases and manages health-care properties—is targeting a 4-acre site on Olivia Way,                               off Interstate 69’s Exit 210. Preliminary plans call for a three-story, 43,000-square-foot facility largely owned by                               the doctors who practice there.

A partnership dubbed Deer Creek Point MOB LLC would own and operate the speculative medical building, which would be funded                               through the sale of “membership units” to participating physicians, according to a project summary provided to                               Fishers Town Council ahead of its Monday meeting.

Cornerstone principals Bob Whitacre and Tag Birge also would purchase an interest in the company and act as its managers,                               the summary said.

"It's a great area with visibility, demographics and rooftops being built nearby," Birge said.

The proposed project represents an $11 million investment that is expected to create 30 jobs within six years, Deer Creek                               Point said in a request for a property-tax abatement filed with the town. The new positions would pay an estimated $45,000                               a year.

Half the jobs are expected to be created within three years, and the other half in the following three years.

Town staff recommends the council approve the incentives to land the project, which will “diversify the business mix                               in the area and create a higher taxable use for this parcel,” Tim Gropp, assistant director of economic development,                               wrote in the summary.

Aside from the two hospitals, nearby development so far has been largely retail. In the long term, a medical office building                               would produce more taxes than a retail building, Gropp told the council.

Council members are weighing whether to declare the parcel an economic revitalization area, the first step in qualifying                               the project for a tax abatement. If final approval comes next month, the town would forgive two-thirds of property taxes for                               six years.

Construction could begin this summer, Birge said.

I don't have a dog in this fight, but doesn't it seem ridiculous that the first item on the developers agenda is tax abatement.                                     Competing for new business is certainly a reality now, but this is different. If I was HamCo, I'd tell them to please put                                     your medical building in a much more convenient place - like Anderson. Location, location, location.

Fishers does indeed have zoning rules prohibiting tax-exempt entities from locating along I-69, but it ends south of Exit                                     210. The request is for a partial six-year abatement, so some taxes would be paid during that six years and then the full                                     amount would be due after that. Tax-exempt entities like churches would never pay taxes.

We live in the area and the article points to IU Health. There is rumbles that IU Health Saxony might close the ER due to                                     low census. A speculative building is not needed. I am sure IU Health has space. The city should mandate a 90% lease commitment                                     before the tax abatement is approved.

I would hope that anyone who truly cares about Fisher, and keeping it a thriving community, would realize that the 3% property                                     tax on an estimated $11 million will bring $330,000 in new tax revenues to Fishers each year. While the first 6 years will                                     see a reduced amount, that property will still generate more than a residential location at only 1%. The addition of 30 jobs                                     at an average salary of $45,000 will also bring payroll taxes and wages to Hamilton county which will benefit everyone. Fishers                                     can not survive as only a residential City, the infrastructure and schools need a healthy commercial tax base to continue                                     to fund them. It may seem like we are giving away money to greedy developers, but they are not making money off of reduced                                     taxes; it is intended to help the new businesses that have to invest in equipment and other business expenses in the first                                     few years of operation to get off the ground.
