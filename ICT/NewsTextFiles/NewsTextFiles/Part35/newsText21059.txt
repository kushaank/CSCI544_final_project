
SKOPJE May 19 (Reuters) - Macedonia's utility ELEM said on Monday it would provide 80 megawatts (MW) of electricity to Serbia's EPS to help the utility cope with flooding that has cut its power output by 40 percent.

"We are assessing the situation on a daily basis," ELEM General Manager Dejan Boskovski told Reuters. "Further deliveries will depend on Serbia's needs."

The utility added that the supplies are also aimed at helping preserve the stability of the Balkan energy system.
