The Nursing in Practice Respect campaign is now live! Over the coming months, we're set to highlight the vital contribution and efforts of primary care and community care nurses throughout the UK.

As part of our campaign, Nursing in Practice is looking to call on parliament to set up a debate to celebrate the vital work that you do.

Nursing in Practice are conducting a survey to find out more about the conversations between parents and healthcare professionals on nutrition in children under 5 years of age.

By taking the survey, you will also have the opportunity to enter into a prize draw for the chance to win one of five M&S vouchers worth £25.
