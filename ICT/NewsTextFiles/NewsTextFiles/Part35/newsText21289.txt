
A United Nations security worker challenged his friends back in Samoa to burpee for baby.

Or, more accurately, to hold a cross-fit fundraising challenge for a young baby girl who has been taken to New Zealand for medical treatment.

Responding to Samoa Observer questions from Israel, via Facebook, Mr. Schmitt said he wanted to dedicate the donation as being from Baby Manu to Baby Anastasia.

“To be honest no matter where, which place and areas I have worked in this world I can sense and have the feeling our people, our community, and our society back home need my help in anyway, and I carry that pride with me everywhere,” he said.

“Our country and my family are most important things in my life.

News of the fundraising challenge from Mr. Schmitt, an armed security guard with the United Nations, was first raised by his friend Afamasaga Rico Tupa’i.

The challenge paid off.

His friends from One Touch Fitness Club donated $2,941 tala to help Baby Anastasia, through the Samoa Victim Support Group.

Afamasaga explained how they were helping Vincent with the donation.

“Vincent is working as a Security at the United Nations,” said Afamasaga.

“Vincent wanted to help baby Anastasia with her operation in New Zealand, so he requested the One Touch Group if we could do an exercise to raise money for Baby Anastasia.

The club decided or agreed to base their fundraiser on burpees – an exercise move consisting of going from a low squat to fully standing, and back down again.

“Each person has to do as much as they can and for each burpee a person does, Vincent gave one tala - say for example some I do 40 burpees so Vincent gives $40 tala for that.

“All of us have done it and so we did 249 burpees each and Vincent donated $2,491 tala for baby Anastasia.

From that amount, it looks like someone did an extra burpee.

Mr. Schmitt’s mother, Titi Schmitt, presented the donation to the S.V.S.G. Friday afternoon.
