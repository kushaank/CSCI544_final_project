
Ten patients will miss their CT scans today and another 66 are in doubt later this week because of industrial action by radiographers at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital.

It comes after  a meeting yesterday between the hospital and the Health Services Union, which failed to reach an agreement over claims of chronic understaffing and unsafe workloads in the radiology department.

HSU WA members voted last week to cancel all CT outpatient services from today.

But it has agreed to exempt patients from country areas and those with critical needs.

The hospital said seven appointments for patients with urgent outpatient needs were among those that would still go ahead today as planned.

Ten less urgent procedures had been rescheduled and the patients were being advised.

Another 66 patients booked in from tomorrow until Friday would have to be assessed.

HSU WA secretary Dan Hill said his members were regularly being forced to work double shifts to make up for the lack of staff.

"Radiographers are often working 16-hour shifts, which is causing major concerns in regards to fatigue," he said.

A hospital spokeswoman said it had been working with the union to resolve the issue and had agreed to extra staff which would allow  a radiographer service 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
