
The Florida Department of Health said the 20 hospital workers at Dr. Phillips Hospital and Orlando Regional Medical Center will be tested this week after they treated the Saudi Arabian man who contracted the virus and was treated in Central Florida hospitals.

The workers previously tested negative for the virus and were asked to stay home for 14 days.

Officials said the MERS virus has a 14-day incubation period, which is why someone could test negative initially, and test positive at a later date.

The 44-year-old patient being treated at the hospital for MERS was released from the hospital after testing negative from the virus and recovering.

Officials said there is no concern for the virus to spread in Central Florida.

A man in Indiana and an Illinois man who came into contact with that person are the other two cases of MERS in the United States.
