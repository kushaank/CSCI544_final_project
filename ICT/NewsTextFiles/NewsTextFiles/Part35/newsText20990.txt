
The AAOMC is part of the International Academy of Orthokeratology (IAO), a worldwide organization of orthokeratologists who provide a non-surgical alternative for the correction of nearsightedness, astigmatism, hyperopia, presbyopia and myopia control. The AAOMC mission is to establish policy and to develop and update protocols and education for doctors performing corneal reshaping (orthokeratology) and myopia control.

Myopia (nearsightedness) is a progressive disease affecting 1.6 billion children and adults worldwide, with expectations that the number will hit 2.5 billion by 2020. Extensive research has provided evidence that orthokeratology can slow the elongation of the eye which contributes to progressive nearsightedness as well as increases the risk of retinal detachments and glaucoma. 20/20 vision can be restored in as little as one day to one month depending on severity. The treatment involves the fitting of a specialized gentle mold designed to reshape the eye surface during sleep refocusing/realigning the visual image to slow or stop eye growth. The image focused by glasses and conventional soft lenses may contribute to the growth of the eye, increasing nearsightedness.
