
A special United Nations defensive military force, recommended by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to protect UN staff and facilities in Mogadishu, was deployed on Sunday to shore up the world body's operations in long-troubled Somalia.

According to a press release from the UN Assistance Mission (UNSOM), Nicholas Kay, Mission chief and Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Somalia, presided over the formal inauguration in Mogadishu of the first-ever United Nations Guard Unit (UNGU).

The UNGU is made up of 410 troops provided by the Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF). The Guard Unit, led by a Ugandan Commander, falls under the responsibility of Kay, the UN designated official in Somalia. The Unit is a "static force" that will be based at Mogadishu International Airport.
