
Greece is expecting a Turkish vessel to conduct research over the Greek continental shelf without permission on Tuesday, government sources have told Kathimerini.

The research vessel, possibly the Cubuklu, is expected to sail in the northern Aegean, west of Samothrace and northwest of Limnos. Greek diplomatic sources said it has been a number of years since such an incident occurred in the Aegean.

It comes at a time when tension between the two sides has increased. A few weeks ago Greek and Turkish air force jets had a mock dogfight for the first time in two years.

The Foreign Ministry has contacted Ankara over the research vesselÂ’s apparent plans. Foreign Minister Evangelos Venizelos may speak directly to his counterpart Ahmet Davutoglu if needed, sources said.
