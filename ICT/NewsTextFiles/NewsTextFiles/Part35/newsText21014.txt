
Six people were taken to the hospital and one man was arrested on Sunday after a car smashed into a South Lubbock home.

Police said a Mustang was headed east on 82nd St., just a few blocks from I-27, at 11 a.m. when the accident happened.

They say the crash was caused by an argument that started between the driver, Tamara Johnson, 31, and her passenger, Anthony Dwayne Johnson, 38, while they were driving.

Police said Anthony hit Tamara, causing her to swerve into oncoming traffic before smashing into the home.

April Meadows, 30, and three children, age 5, 6 and 2 years old, were inside the home when the car plowed through the front door and living room.

The mother, all three children and the driver of the car were taken to the hospital with moderate injuries. April and two of her children have been released from the hospital as of Monday afternoon. 5-year-old Keely Meadows remains in satisfactory condition.

Accident investigators are still looking into the incident.
