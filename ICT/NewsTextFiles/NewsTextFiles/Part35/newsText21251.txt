
19 May 2014  The United Nations mission in Libya today voiced deep concern over the recent violence in the country, and called on all sides to address differences through political means and on authorities to quickly address the lawlessness.

According to media reports, fierce fighting swept across the capital, Tripoli, on Sunday, after armed men stormed the countryâ€™s interim parliament. The violence is reported to be some of the worst since the 2011 uprising that ousted former leader Muammar al-Qadhafi.

It also condemned the grave security deterioration in the eastern region resulting in the high number of civilian casualties.

â€œThe Mission calls on the authorities to immediately and quickly address the lawlessness, including the series of assassinations targeting the army, police and judiciary personnel, and to develop and implement a comprehensive security plan with the participation of political, security and social actors,â€� it stated.

While undergoing its democratic transition, Libya has also been grappling with a deteriorating security situation. The first three months of this year witnessed a dramatic increase in violence across the country, according to the Secretary-Generalâ€™s Special Representative and head of UNSMIL, Tarek Mitri, including targeted assassinations, bombings, abductions and attacks on state institutions and civilians.
