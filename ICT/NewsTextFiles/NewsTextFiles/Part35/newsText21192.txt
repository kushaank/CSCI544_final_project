
The Commission is keen to strengthen the political and technical dialogue with Morocco, based on our mutual interests and concerns and we have also talked about how to strengthen the political steering of that process. Our commitment to successful relations with Morocco is for the long term and for the benefit of all our people.

Since 2011, Morocco has undertaken many important reforms and has announced further steps, demonstrating a genuine commitment to modernization and democratization. In particular, I welcome the increased role of women in public and political life. I also welcome the announced reform on Judiciary, notably the reform of the military Judiciary.

Therefore, my second message is that the EU encourages Morocco to continue with the implementation of political, economic and social reforms in accordance with the legitimate aspirations of the Moroccan people.

- our continued commitment based on the 'more for more' principle: the more ambitious Morocco will be in its reforms, the greater financial support it will get from the EU.

I reiterated that we are, as committed today as at the time when we adopted the words that are the basis of our partnership and we stand ready to repeat that committed in deeds.'
