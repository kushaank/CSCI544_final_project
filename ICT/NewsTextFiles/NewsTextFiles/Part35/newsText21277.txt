
Mogadishu, 15 May 2013 - Speaking at the Heritage Institute for Policy Studies in Mogadishu today, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG), Nicholas Kay highlighted the political, economic and security progress that Somalia has made and called on the Federal Government and Parliament to make faster progress with implementation of Somalia’s plan for peace and state building called Vision 2016.

Mr Kay said “Somalia’s institutions and leaders must unite and work together to deliver the ambitious plan that the people want to see delivered. On the ground projects must begin benefiting the people who need them the most.

The SRSG also highlighted the importance of cementing recent military successes against Al-Shabaab in newly recovered areas by delivering much needed Government services to prevent insecurity returning. He went on to draw attention to the need for the international community to do better at focusing support to build an effective Somali National Army that is able to take over eventually from AMISOM. More broadly, he stressed the need for the New Deal Somalia Compact to start receiving funding and delivering flagship programmes on the ground in the coming few months.
