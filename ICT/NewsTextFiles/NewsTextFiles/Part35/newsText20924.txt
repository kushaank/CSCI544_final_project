
A UGANDAN HIV-positive nurse was sentenced to three years in jail today after being convicted of criminal negligence for allegedly trying to infect her patient with HIV.

Rosemary Namubiru maintained her innocence throughout the trial, insisting that there was no malice involved when she accidentally pricked herself one day in January and then used the same contaminated needle to give a baby an injection.

She was later denied bail in a controversial decision by a magistrate who ruled that she posed a danger to the public.

Two tests have shown the child was not infected with HIV.

Despite this, her arrest was widely covered in the local press, with some dubbing her the “killer nurse” in contravention of standards around fair trial.
