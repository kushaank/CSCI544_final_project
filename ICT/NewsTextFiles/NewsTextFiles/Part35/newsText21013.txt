
It happened on Country Club Road at around 9 p.m. Sunday.

Police say a father, son and cousin were arrested, all of whom live together in the house where the shooting occurred. The shooting resulted from a family fight.

They say Emmanuel Arango showed up drunk at the home, prompting his uncle Marco Osario, 82, to kick him out at gunpoint. Arango allegedly then violently attacked Marco Osario. Osario's son Robinson then allegedly shot Arango to save his father.

All three were arrested and charged for their involvement. A judge issued a protective order preventing Arango from moving back into the family home.

The family says Marco Osario did not appear in court today because he is still in the hospital recovering from his injuries.
