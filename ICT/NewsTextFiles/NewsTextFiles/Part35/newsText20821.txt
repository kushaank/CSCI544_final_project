
Tallahassee, FL - A study session ends with a man behind bars, accused of biting his girlfriend's bottom lip off.

It happened at the Starbucks on West Tennessee Street just before midnight.

The woman told police that she and 24-year-old Michael Johnson were studying outside when they started arguing over text messages from other women.

Court records say Johnson became irate. When the woman got into her car to leave, she says he bent down and she thought he was going to kiss her, but he bit her bottom lip off.

Arrest papers say police later found Johnson looking for her lip in the bushes near Starbucks. Officers found it, but doctors told them chances of reattaching it are not good.
