
BRUSSELS, May 19 (RIA Novosti) – NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Monday that the military alliance does not plan to amend its framework agreement with Russia.

“At this stage, I do not foresee any NATO request to change the content of the NATO-Russia Founding Act, but we would also expect Russia to live up to the basic principles of that act,” the NATO chief said at a press conference in Brussels.

In April, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused NATO of having breached the principles of the accord by stepping up air patrols on its western border and in the Black Sea zone. Rasmussen responded by saying the accusation stemmed from a “baseless interpretation” of the agreement.
