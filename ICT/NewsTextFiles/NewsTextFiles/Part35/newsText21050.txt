
The houseboy, who killed eight persons in a gruesome  massacre more than 13 years ago in Bacolod City, is now facing a jail term of  379 years.

On Thursday, he was sentenced to 120 years  imprisonment for the murder of three of his minor victims, without eligibility  for parole.

Bacolod Regional Trial Court Branch 52 Judge Raymond  Joseph Javier found Bemon Barrios Gallo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the  murder of brothers Mark Anthony, 13, Guillermo Benrico, 11, and John Michael,  9, all surnamed Rivilla, and sentenced him to reclusion perpetua on three  counts.

Supt. Amelito Fuentes, warden of the Bacolod Bureau of  Jail Management and Penology, said Saturday that Gallo, 34, had previous  sentences in connection with the Rivilla massacre totaling 259 years.

Gallo was accused of killing the owners of a sugar  central, their son, three grandchildren, and two house helpers at the family compound  at 24th-Aguinaldo streets in Bacolod City.

Killed were Carlos Rivilla Jr., 76, his wife Florinda,  75, son Guillermo Benrico, 42, father of the three minors, and their helpers  Dolores Ogatis, 20, and Ritchell Gonzales, 19.

Fuentes said Gallo was earlier sentenced to reclusion  perpetua for the murder of the five adults, for a total jail term of 200 years.
