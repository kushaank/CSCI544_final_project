
UNITED NATIONS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki- moon has appointed Major General Hafiz Masroor Ahmed of Pakistan as his new force commander for the United Nations Operation in Cote d'Ivoire (UNOCI), UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters here Monday.

Major General Ahmed, who is currently commanding of an infantry division in Pakistan and brings with him 30 years of national and international military experience, will replace Major General Muhammad Iqbal Asi who is also from Pakistan. Asi completed his two-year tenure last month, said Dujarric at a daily news briefing here.

UNOCI was established in February 2004 with a mandate to facilitate the implementation of the peace agreement signed by the Ivorian parties in January 2003.

Following the 2010 presidential election and the ensuing political crisis in Cote d'Ivoire, UNOCI has remained on the ground to protect civilians, support the Ivorian government in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) of former combatants, and helped the government on security sector reform.
