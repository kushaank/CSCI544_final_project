“Output may fall by 100,000 tonnes this year,” Asril Sutan Amir, adviser to the Indonesian Rubber Association (GAPKINDO), told Reuters today, ahead of a rubber summit in Singapore.

“We could see double wintering,” Asril said, referring to the risk of an extended dry season, when leaves fall and trees produce less rubber.

Global weather forecasters in recent months have said that the likelihood is increasing of an El Nino event, a warming of sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific, which heightens uncertainty in global commodity markets.
