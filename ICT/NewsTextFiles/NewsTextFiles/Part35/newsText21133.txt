
The Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers and Caterers (KAHC) Kilifi County chairlam Philip Chai termed the evacuations as “the last nail on the tourism coffin for Kenya”. He added that although they were totally uncalled-for, “they are a result of choices we made and we were told that choices have consequences”.

Nairobi. Tourism investors in Kenya cried foul over a massive airlift of hundreds of foreign tourists from the country by Britain, Australia and France who cited insecurity concerns.

The developing crisis in Kenya is, however, partly blamed on the al-Qaeda linked Al-Shabaab whose stronghold inside Somalia was yesterday pounded by fighter jets in the latest push by African Union troops to root out the insurgents.

The air strikes on the town of Jilib are understood to be part of the offensive by the 22,000-strong UN-backed AU force, who launched in March a fresh bid to wrest remaining towns from the Al-Shabaab.

Kenyan forces are also in Somalia ever since they were ordered in by the previous regime to fight Al-Shabaab fighters who had masterminded several attacks on its soil and abducted tourists among other hostages. “I heard two heavy explosions, military jets were flying over the city,” said Osman Mohamed, a resident of Jilib. The impoverished town is a key Al-Shabaab hub in southern Somalia’s Middle Juba region, some 320 kilometres southwest of Mogadishu.

Senior Al-Shabaab commander Sheikh Ibrahim Abu Hamze said war planes had struck the town, but denied any casualties.

“The mujahedeen fighters have managed to repel the enemy with anti-aircraft weaponry, they have fled,” claimed Abu Hamze in a telephone interview with AFP.

It was not immediately clear where the jets were from, but Kenya is part of the AU force and has used its air planes to strike Al-Shabaab bases before.

Hardline Al-Shabaab insurgents once controlled most of southern and central Somalia.
