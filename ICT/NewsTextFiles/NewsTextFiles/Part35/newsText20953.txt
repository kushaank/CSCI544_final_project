
Srinagar: A minor was killed and another injured when a littered shell exploded in central Kashmir’s Tosamaidan meadow, officials said Monday.

Twelve year old Simran Riyaz and her eight year old brother Fayaz Ahmad were fiddling with an unexploded shell in Drang area when it suddenly exploded causing critical injuries to both of them. “Simran died instantly and Faizan was rushed to hospital in Budgam from where he was referred to a Srinagar hospital,” officials told GNS.

“Both of them had gone to a nearby forest to collect wood. When they were on way to their house, they saw an object and took it with them and started to play with it at their house and as a result the shell exploded,” a source told GNS.
