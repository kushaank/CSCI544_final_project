A Western New York Couple has welcomed quadruplets into their family, and boy are they busy!

WARSAW, NY -- The Nevinger's are about as busy as any family can be. Christine and Greg Nevinger welcomed quadruplets into their family! The couple had two girls and wanted to try for a boy, and boy, oh boy! The couple learned they were carrying four babies. Three boys and a girl. The boys are identical triplets - which means one egg split three times - and Cora is their fraternal sister. Christine said she was totally shocked when her doctor told her the news. She gave birth at 31-weeks to four healthy babies all weighing between three and four pounds! The babies were born on Valentine's Day!

The community came together for a baby shower to help the family with four of everything. As you can imagine, the family does need an awful lot of baby supplies. They go through thirty diapers everyday. They have a very busy routine but are doing great. They do still need supplies. If you would like to help, you can find more information on the Nevinger's facebook page .  You can also send gifts to Adventures of the Nevinger's at PO Box 401 Warsaw NY 14569.
