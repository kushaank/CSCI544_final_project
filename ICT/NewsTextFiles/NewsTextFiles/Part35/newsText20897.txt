
A man from Saudi Arabia who is one of three patients diagnosed with a Middle East respiratory virus in the United States has been released from an Orlando, Florida, hospital.

Officials from the state health department and Dr. P. Phillips Hospital said in a news release Monday that the 44-year-old unidentified man has been discharged.

They say the man has recovered from the virus and is now testing negative for Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.

Officials say at least 20 health care workers at two Orlando hospitals came into contact with the man, and they all have tested negative, too.

A man in Indiana and an Illinois man who came into contact with that person are the other two cases of MERS in the United States.
