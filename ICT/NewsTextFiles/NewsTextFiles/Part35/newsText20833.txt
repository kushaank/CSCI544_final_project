The 42nd annual Frist Humanitarian National Awards are HCA’s        highest honor.

Dr. McCoy received the        national physician award on April 28 in Nashville at a special ceremony,        along with a $10,000 donation to his favorite charity. He chose to        donate his award money to the Sojourn Center, an organization dedicated        to developing a hospice house and end of life center.

Established in 1971, the Frist Humanitarian Awards honor outstanding        individuals for their humanitarian and volunteer activities. The awards        are given annually in recognition of the caring spirit and philanthropic        work of the late Dr. Thomas Frist Sr., a founder of HCA. Employees,        volunteers and medical staff members who demonstrate commitment and        dedication to providing outstanding care and humanitarianism are        selected from across the country, and honorees are recognized at the        local level. Three national recipients are then chosen from more than        200 hospital-level honorees.
