
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde joined public figures including U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama in calling for the release of girls kidnapped by Islamist group Boko Haram in Nigeria.

Boko Haram, which means “western education is a sin” in the local Hausa language, is waging a violent campaign in the northeast to create an Islamic state, exacerbating an education crisis in Africa’s biggest economy. The raid on the all-girls school village has galvanized social media campaigns that have included Pakistani teenage activist Malala Yousafzai using the Twitter hashtag #BringBackOurGirls.

Lagarde, a regular proponent of women’s rights , last week canceled plans to deliver the commencement address at Smith College , bowing to protests by students and faculty over the fund’s policies.

Press spacebar to pause and continue. Press esc to stop.
