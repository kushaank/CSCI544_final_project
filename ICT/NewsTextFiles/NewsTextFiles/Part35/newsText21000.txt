
JOINT BASE ELMENDORF-RICHARDSON, Alaska (May 19, 2014) A woman was in a hospital in stable condition Monday after a bear attacked Sunday morning at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska.

She suffered lacerations to her neck, arms and legs in the attack.

The woman and her husband were running on base when she got ahead of her husband, and came up on a sow with two cubs nearby.

The bear went into a defensive posture, Maj. Angela Webb said, and the woman either played dead or was knocked unconscious when the bear swiped at her.

A passer-by picked her up and took her to the base hospital before she was transferred to the Alaska Native Medical Center.

The victim asked that her identity not be released.

Base officials have closed all recreational trails near the attack site as they investigate.
