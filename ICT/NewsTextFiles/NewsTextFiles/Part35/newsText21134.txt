
A lawyer for former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn says his client has asked him to sue the makers of a film about a sex addict who commits a sex assault on a hotel maid.

The new movie “Welcome to New York,” starring French star Gerard Depardieu, was featured at a screening in Cannes, coinciding with the French city’s famous film festival. It’s billed as a fictional story and includes a legal disclaimer.

But Strauss-Kahn's lawyer says the film is defamatory because its subject matter is similar to the accusations leveled against his client after a New York hotel maid said he sexually assaulted her.

Strauss-Kahn settled a civil case by the woman after criminal charges were dropped.

Attorney Jean Veil reminded listeners that the lawsuit happened three years ago and Strauss-Kahn was cleared, while speaking to Europe 1 radio Monday, Reuters reported.

"He is frightened, sickened (by the film). He has instructed his lawyers, myself, to make a complaint for defamation based on accusations of rape, on the insinuations made throughout this film," Veil said.

The film opens with an extended sex-party scene before the encounter between the main character, George Devereau, and a hotel maid. Depardieu appears naked and indulges in sexual activity with several partners throughout the over 20-minute scene.

Following the "Welcome to New York" screening at Cannes, the film was made available throughout France on pay-per-view.
