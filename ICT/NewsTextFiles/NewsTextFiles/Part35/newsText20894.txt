
A LEADING doctor has resigned from his clinical director post at Beaumont Hospital, citing patient safety concerns.

In an email sent last Friday, Prof Shane O’Neill told hospital management that he could not stand over “significant clinical risks”.

A new psychiatric unit opens on the Beaumont campus - serving north Dublin - this week.

It is understood his concerns relate to plans to continue to admit some seriously psychiatrically ill patients to the new unit via Beaumont’s emergency department.

In previous correspondence, he said that assessing psychiatric patients in the frequently overcrowded emergency department was “entirely unsafe and indefensible”.

Prof O’Neill described the model of care being proposed in conjunction with the opening of the new psychiatric unit as “entirely inappropriate”.

Beaumont Hospital confirmed to The Herald that Prof O'Neill indicated his intention to step down from his post as clinical director for medicine at the hospital. It said he remains as a consultant at Beaumont.

The hospital said the Ashlin Centre, a new purpose-built adult HSE psychiatric facility located on its campus, will provide 38 general adult beds and six psychiatry of old-age acute admission beds.

Proposals have been made to have out-of-hours and weekend assessments for the centre carried out at the emergency department. The finalisation of these proposals is under discussion between the HSE and Beaumont.
