
All professional vehicles used to transport people or goods will have to be equipped with the European-wide eCall safety feature by the start of 2018, according to a new regulation.

The system allows professional drivers to call for assistance on the 112 hotline in the case of an emergency.

According to the European Commission, the system has contributed to a 10 percent drop in road deaths in other countries.
