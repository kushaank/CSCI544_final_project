
ANTANANARIVO, May 19 (Reuters) - The World Bank will give Madagascar $400 million in financial support over three years, after recently restoring ties following a peaceful election, while the European Union said it was resuming full relations with the Indian Ocean island.

The World Bank said in March it was normalising relations after suspending budgetary support during a five-year political crisis triggered by a 2009 coup.

Other donors have also moved to restore ties following the smooth election of President Hery Rajaonarimampianina in December. The European Union said in a statement on Monday that it was restarting full development cooperation with Madagascar and its Commissioner for Development, Andris Piebalgs, would visit the island in June.

Makhtar Diop, World Bank Vice President for Africa, said the bank was ready to unlock funding after being reassured by Rajaonarimampianina that the new government was committed to taking steps to improve "economic governance".
