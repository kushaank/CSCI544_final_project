
Regularly visiting the doctor may drastically cut your risk of dying from the most deadly form of skin cancer, according to a new study.

Researchers reviewed melanoma cases of 251 white patients from 2001 to 2007.

Participants were an average age of on average 60 years old — the age at which patients generally are diagnosed with melanoma generally is diagnosed — and 158 of them were men. For the period studied, all of the patients had health insurance and access to care in a health maintenance organization.

The risk for death from melanoma decreased 70 percent for patients who had seen a family doctor or specialist at least once in the five years before they were diagnosed. After controlling for other chronic conditions, gender, age and other factors, researchers found that visiting a specialist before a melanoma diagnosis may reduce the risk of dying by 90 percent.

Access to health care may not be the only barrier to getting care, researchers said. Patients who are more engaged in their care may do better.

The study was presented at the annual meeting in May of the Society of Investigative Dermatology.
