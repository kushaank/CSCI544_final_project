
FORT WAYNE, Ind. (21Alive) – Lutheran Children's Hospital hosted "Donate Eight" to support children with cancer who are dealing with hair loss.

The event was held Sunday afternoon and helped provide hair and financial donations to non-profit wig suppliers.

Donators stopped by the hospital to have eight inches of their hair cut. People from across northeast Indiana donated their hair and money toward the cause.

While managing a serious illness like cancer can be daunting for anyone, the donations can help the children feel like a kid again.

“My main thing was to help get the community involved and get some awareness for the children out there that might have problems with whatever health problems they have and what the public can do to make them feel better,” said Mike James, event organizer.

James says 92 donations were received at the event.
