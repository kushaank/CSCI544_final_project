
Â Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras Sunday voiced confidence about the country's exit from a painful four-year debt crisis, as the first round of local elections got underway.

"In a democratic manner and with unity we are exiting the crisis," Xinhua quoted the conservative leader as saying, after he voted at the southern Greek city of Pylos.

"This day is dedicated to local administration. I hope peoples' choices of mayors and regional governors will be towards growth, employment and better quality of services for citizens," Deputy Prime Minister Evangelos Venizelos said.
