
THE country's main children's hospital is increasing security in preparation for this weekend's string of sold-out One Direction concerts.

Dublin's Temple Street University Hospital is recruiting extra security staff and is due to hold a meeting about implementing an emergency contingency plan to cope in the event of a large volume of A&E traffic.

The extra precautions are being taken to ensure that the hospital, which is a short distance from the Croke Park concert venue, is prepared for all situations, given the large number of children and teenagers due to flock to the 82,000-seat stadium for the Dublin leg of the One Direction 'Where We Are' tour.

"Security is being increased and other back-up plans are still in progress," said a source. "The precautions are being taken because of the large number of young people who will be in the area and to ensure that if there are extra numbers at the hospital, they will be dealt with safely and quickly."

Promoters MCD have already warned that strict restrictions will be in place at Croke Park and children under the age of 14 who have purchased pitch tickets will be turned away from the gig.

Concert chiefs have also insisted that they will be ensuring that any child under the age of 16 is accompanied by a parent or guardian at the concerts.

Around 240,000 One Direction fans will descend upon GAA headquarters to see the 'What Makes You Beautiful' hitmakers, including Mullingar heartthrob Niall Horan, at their Friday, Saturday and Sunday night concerts this weekend.
