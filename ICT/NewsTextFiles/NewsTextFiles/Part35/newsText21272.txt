Meanwhile, government forces are in full control of Damascus, but militants still hold a few towns and villages on the outskirts of the city.

Syrian troops have in recent months gained the upper hand in battles against militants.

The safe exit of rebels from Homs was part of the agreement which was brokered by Iran, Russia and the United Nations.

The deal also brought almost all major districts of the city under the control of government forces. The Syrian governmentâ€™s talks with the rebels came as part of efforts to facilitate access to the people trapped in conflict zones.

The agreement required the rebel forces to allow aid into two northwestern towns of Kafr Nabl and al-Zahraa. They also agreed to release dozens of soldiers and civilians held hostage.
