
The Supreme Court vacation bench of justice BS Chauhan and justice AK Sikri gave relief to Tejpal on an urgent hearing sought by his counsel Sandeep Kapur.

Tejpal is in Sada sub-jail in Goa’s Vasco town since November 30, 2013 on the charges of allegedly raping his colleague.

Kapur mentioned the matter before the court took up cases scheduled for hearing.

Due to the urgency, the bench called for the file related to Tejpal’s regular bail plea on which SC had on April 21 issued notice to Goa police.

Without going into the merits of his bail petition the court ordered interim bail for three weeks after his lawyer said Tejpal’s mother had expired on Sunday night at Goa’s Moira village and her last rites were scheduled for Monday evening.

Shakuntala Tejpal (87) was suffering from cancer.

Tejpal’s plea for regular bail could come up for hearing during the vacations in June.

Issuing notice to Goa police the apex court had given it four weeks time to respond, which ends on May 21.
