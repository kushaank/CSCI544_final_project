
Officials in Kenya say suspected Somali militants have ambushed a border area, killing at least 12 people.

Government officials say at least three police reservists were among the dead following Monday's attack in northeastern Kenya, near its border with Somalia. They say police officers who responded to the attack drove into the ambush, and at least two police vehicles were destroyed.

Kenya has faced a series of attacks that it blames on the Somali militant group al-Shabab, including an attack on the capital, Nairobi, on Friday.

That attack came right after Britain, the United States and other Western countries issued travel advisories to their citizens in Kenya, warning of potential attacks.

Last year, al-Shabab claimed responsibility for an attack on Nairobi's Westgate mall in which more than 60 people were killed.

An African Union force that includes Kenyan troops has been battling the al-Qaida-linked group inside Somalia.
