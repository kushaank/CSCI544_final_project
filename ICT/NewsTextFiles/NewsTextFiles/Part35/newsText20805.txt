
A MIDWIFE who was desperate to get home after ordering a takeaway curry told a pregnant woman to “hurry up” and have her baby, a tribunal has heard.

Jeanette Matthews allegedly threatened the expectant mother, saying: “If you don’t hurry up and have the baby I’m going to cut you”. The midwife also told her that the labour ward was short staffed and that she did not want to be there, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard.

Matthews was the allocated midwife for the ‘Patient A’ on the labour ward at the Airedale General Hospital in Keighley.

Greg Unwin, for the NMC, said: “A complaint was received from a patient or the patient’s mother in relation to the registrant’s conduct on the 20 February 2011.

“Patient A was admitted to Airedale General Hospital on the 19 February and delivered her baby during the night shift of the early hours of the 20 February.

“The registrant was her allocated midwife. It is said that the registrant was rude in her conduct, that she inappropriately asked Patient A to stop using pain relief and that she had the patient in the lithotomy position.

Mr Unwin said that when asked about the incident, the registrant denied she had told the patient to stop using her pain relief.

Matthews also claimed she had obtained proper consent before putting the patient into the lithotomy position, the panel heard.

She faces a series of charges relating to alleged misconduct and lack of competence at the NMC tribunal in central London which she has chosen not to attend.
