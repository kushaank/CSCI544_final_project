
The common belief before the local government elections that that the electorate was swaying between the need for stability and the demand for an alternative solution.

As such, most estimated that the results would not bring out any serious political issue and through a subtle process of social coordination relative balance would be ensured, allowing the government to carry on its work and more so to ensure that it will the one to manage the critical negotiations for the new public debt relief.

The first impressions of the exit polls on Sunday that showed SYRIZA leading the way in Attica and Athens put those aforementioned estimations to the test.

However, as the votes were being counted on Sunday evening, the early impressions became softer and the political system was brought back to the previous dilemma between the need for stability and demand for an alternative solution.

The Greek people did not condemn Mr. Samaras and Mr. Venizelos, like many expected, nor did they put SYRIZA on the path to power, like others predicted.

We suspect that the Greek people will voter with a similarly balanced intention on the next Sunday as well.

Mr. Samaras and Mr. Venizelos will continue governing the country for the foreseeable future and appear to be the ones who will negotiate the new debt relief.

Mr. Tsipras will have to work very hard in the future in order to convince the Greek people that he is a reliable alternative solution for Greece.
