The US and its European allies have agreed that Russia would face broader economic and industrial sanctions if the Kremlin meddled in the Ukrainian elections later this month, a US official said.

US Secretary of State John Kerry briefed Germany, France, Britain and Italy on Washington's thinking on sanctions being imposed on some of the Russian economy's most important business sectors, including mining, gas, banking, finance and defence, the official said.

In the next phase of punitive measures, use would be made of "a scalpel rather than a hammer" and the focus would be on stopping investment in those areas, the official said after Kerry's meeting with his European counterparts.

Ukraine's interim leaders hope elections on May 25 will bring political stability after five months of upheaval, including Russia's annexation of Crimea and pro-Russian separatist rebellions in the east.

Washington and the EU have already imposed several rounds of sanctions on Russian individuals and some companies, accusing Russian President Vladimir Putin of stoking the eastern rebellions, a charge Putin has denied.

"All ministers, led by Kerry, underscored that a free, fair election across Ukraine, including in the east, on May 25 is absolutely essential," the senior State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said to reporters.

Kerry told the European powers the sectoral sanctions could be imposed on Russia without hurting those imposing them, or the broader global economy, the official said.

Moscow's economy minister, Alexei Ulyukayev, has said the economy will almost certainly enter recession by the end of next month.
