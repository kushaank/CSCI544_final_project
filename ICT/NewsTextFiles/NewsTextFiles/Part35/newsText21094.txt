
Jakarta (ANTARA News) - A carrier vessel (CV) is not yet required to strengthen the countrys primary weaponry defense system (alutsista), Indonesian Military (TNI) Chief General Moeldoko claimed here on Monday.

After inaugurating a joint military exercise of TNI at the Halim Perdanakusuma Airbase, General Moeldoko remarked that a carrier vessel did not correspond to the doctrine of the TNI.

According to Moeldoko, an aircraft carrier vessel was not necessary as the TNI could make use of any of the thousand Indonesian islands spread from Sabang to Merauke as an airbase for the airplanes of the Indonesian Air Force.

Small islands can be used to store, land, and park aircrafts just like it is done on a carrier vessel, Moeldoko pointed out.

Meanwhile, Indonesian Navy Chief Admiral Marsetio explained that the doctrine adopted by the Navy was Green Water Navy, which meant that the main task of its soldiers was to provide national coastal defense.

"Only countries that have Blue Water Navy (a navy possessing maritime expeditionary capabilities) need aircraft carriers," Marsetio added.

Marsetio reiterated that countries adopting the Blue Water Navy tend to be aggressors towards the sovereignty of other nations, whereas Indonesia preferred to prioritize its sovereignty in first place.

Indonesia is currently awaiting the delivery of three new multirole warships from a British manufacturer. The three ships will be named KRI Bung Tomo, KRI John Lee, and KRI Usman Harun.

The three warships will be installed with new types of missiles, rockets, and radar.
