
The OSCEâ€™s representative on freedom of the media, Dunja   Mijatovic, has addressed the coup-imposed acting Ukrainian   Interior Minister Arsen Avakov in a letter, urging to release the   LifeNews journalists detained by Kiev forces on Sunday and   thoroughly investigate the incident, Itar-Tass reports.

In the letter, the OSCE representative has urged to â€œstop   intimidating and threatening members of the media,â€� stressing   that journalists must be allowed to do their jobs without fearing   for their security.

The political powers in Ukraine â€œmust fully realize that   obstruction of the freedom of media is unacceptable,â€� Mijatovic   said.

The detained journalists, Oleg Sidyakin and Marat Saichenko, are   being investigated on the charges of â€œaiding the terrorist   groups,â€� deputy secretary of Ukraineâ€™s National Security and   Defense Council (SNBO), Victoria Sumar, wrote on her Facebook   page.

She added that there is â€œdirect video evidenceâ€� of her   claims, pointing at footage released on Monday showing Ukrainian   troops rudely forcing a group of handcuffed people to get down on   their knees and looking through belongings that appeared to have   belonged to them.

Along with a close-up of the documents of two LifeNews   journalists, the video showed some journalistic equipment, a pile   of Ukrainian hrivnyas and Russian rubles, and a MANPAD with   inscriptions in Polish. The third man shown kneeling on the   ground was not identified.

The Ukrainian Security Service said on Monday, without   elaborating, that two Russian citizens detained in the Donetsk   Region with video equipment have been brought to Kiev for   interrogation.

Meanwhile, a member of Russiaâ€™s presidential Human Rights Council   negotiating with Kiev authorities, Maksim Shevchenko, said that   the journalists are being accused of allegedly taking part in â€œviolent interrogationsâ€� of â€˜Alfaâ€™ Ukrainian special   service officers, and asking questions.

Shevchenko said he believes that the detained journalists did not   take part in any interrogations, but some other journalists did,   and in this sense LifeNews reporters were â€œset upâ€� by   those other people. The human rights activist said the council   will ask distinguished Kiev lawyers to defend the LifeNews   journalists in court.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Monday stressed that   the Russian journalists detained in the Donetsk Region must be   released immediately.

â€œWe are concerned that during combat actions, which are led   by [Ukrainian] armed forces with the participation of radicals,   extremists, militants of the Right Sector and other groups, some   journalists are suffering. Very often they are detained, faced   with fictitious demands, which do not fit into generally   recognized norms. The latter concerns two journalists from the   LifeNews channel,â€� Lavrov said.

According to Lavrov, Moscow has been using all available OSCE   channels, urging the organization to facilitate the journalistsâ€™   release.

LifeNews journalists meanwhile started a Twitter campaign under   the hashtag #SaveOurGuys. In just hours, thousands have shared   their pictures with the hashtag written on sheets of paper, or   retweeted them.

Representatives from the Russian Union of Journalists started   OSCE-brokered Vienna negotiations with the counterparts from   Ukraine on Monday. The Ukrainian side has been asked to help   prevent cases of detention and harassment of Russian journalists.

The unionâ€™s head, Pavel Gusev, told Itar-Tass that it is   appealing to international organizations, including the OSCE,   with a statement demanding the reportersâ€™ release.

â€œThis is a heinous campaign, when the journalists are being   presented as terrorists and their work is obstructed...All the   actions of the Ukrainian side contradict with international   norms,â€� Gusev said, calling on Kiev to free the Russian   journalists and apologize to them.

Numerous cases of Kiev-installed authorities banning Russian   media workers from entering Ukraine have intensified, along with   cases of their detention and deportation by special services   and law enforcement for covering the events in eastern Ukraine.

Moreover, several cases of Ukrainian troops firing at people with cameras, even at those   wearing blue press vests, have been reported. A video journalist   working for RTâ€™s Ruptly crew in the volatile eastern Ukrainian   city of Mariupol was shot at and seriously injured during Kievâ€™s military operation on May 9. A   medical jet sent for him was allowed to land in Donetsk only   after three days of negotiations.

The situation with the LifeNews crew is â€œbad newsâ€� for   journalists working in Ukraine and for the international   community, and it will only get worse as the Ukrainian election â€“   set for May 25 â€“ nears, Martin McCauley, an Eastern Europe expert   from the University of London, told RT.

â€œIn the week up to next Sundayâ€™s presidential election, the   situation will be very tense and the Kiev authorities will be   very keen to stop journalists whom they regard as supporting the   other side, or supporting separatism, and so on, from doing their   jobs,â€� McCauley said.

According to the analyst, the international community should â€œdo moreâ€� to ensure the rights of journalists are   observed in Ukraine.

â€œIt is up to the OSCE and the European Union and others to   make clear to the authorities in Kiev that journalists should be   allowed to do their job. If they are accused of terrorism, then   they should be brought before a court with due judicial process   being observed...It is up to the Kiev authorities to present the   evidence and then a have a due process of law,â€� he said.

â€œIt has got to a situation where if the Kiev authorities   believe that all separatists are terrorists, then all journalists   who communicate with them and engage in interviews with them and   pass on information to them, they then become terrorists as well.   So therefore you have got an extraordinary situation in which   journalists are not able to carry out their duties in eastern   Ukraine,â€� McCauley said.

Remember journalist Anna Politkovskaya murdered by the current regime in the Kremlin, activist denouncing human rights violations in Chechnya.

Their killers were found guilty, missing catch the person behind the behest of the crime.

Ukraine Western coup has become another disaster particularly for the U.S. So up to now;
