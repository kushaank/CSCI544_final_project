
Last year marked the 15th year that the   Norwegian Refugee Council ’s Internal Displacement Monitoring Center started keeping track of internally displaced people around the world. Created at the request of the   United Nations , the IDP database has been monitoring conflict-induced internal displacement in more than 50 countries. In 1998, it recorded 19.3 million IDPs.

IDMC’s 2013 report , which was released this month, notes even larger numbers and further underscores the urgent need to address worldwide internal displacement. At the end of 2013, IDPs driven away by armed conflict, “generalized violence” and human rights violations numbered 33.3 million — up 16 percent from the 28.8 million reported IDPs in 2012.

This year’s higher figure was largely due to three factors: new large-scale movements; challenges in working toward what the IDMC calls “durable solutions,” or when IDPs have achieved sustainable integration into either their places of origin or new settlements; and better data collection. While several hurdles continue to hamper the quality of information about IDPs — problems that IDMC itself acknowledges — there has been improvement in the availability of data about internal displacement. Nigeria’s National Commission for Refugees, for example, produced figures on its IDPs for the first time in 2013.
