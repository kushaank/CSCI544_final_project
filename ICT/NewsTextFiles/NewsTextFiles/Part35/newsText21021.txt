
The shooting happened about 8:20 a.m. in the parking area of the Westwind Lodge, 336 W. MacArthur Blvd. The boy, whose name was not released, was hit in the buttocks and was expected to recover from his wounds, police said.

Police said the Oakland youth had been visiting someone at the motel and left with some friends before the shooting. Investigators were trying to determine if the shooting resulted from a robbery attempt or something else.

After the shooting, the youth was able to run a short distance to West MacArthur and Broadway, where hospital employees treated him until paramedics arrived.

Another person with the victim apparently shot at the suspects as they fled in a car northbound on Manila Avenue, police said. That person was detained by officers for questioning.

The person who shot the youth has not been arrested.

Traffic lanes on Broadway and West MacArthur were closed for the investigation but were reopened by 11:30 a.m.
