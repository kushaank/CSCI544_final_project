
Socialist Party campaign chief Zsolt Molnár has been blackmailed due to a photograph taken while he was on holiday, prompting him to resign his post as president of the Budapest chapter of the Socialist Party last week, ATV reported Sunday evening.

Molnár was sent the message that there is some kind of a recording of his holiday with Socialist candidate for mayor of Budapest Csaba Horváth.

The sender threatened to make the recording public unless Molnár quits.

Molnár admitted the blackmail to ATV, but did not say what happened on the holiday trip.

Molnar is fucking Horvath. No doubt about it. The photograph is of Molnar blowing off Horvath on the beach.

But that’s said to be a “progressive, leftist” thing, so he’s supposed to be proud of that.
