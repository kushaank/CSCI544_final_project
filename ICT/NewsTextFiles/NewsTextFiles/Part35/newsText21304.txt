
JUBA, South Sudan, 19 May 2014 – The caseload of cholera is rapidly increasing in South Sudan and the deadly, highly contagious disease appears to be spreading, UNICEF said today.

Since the outbreak of cholera in the capital Juba late last week, the reported cholera caseload has doubled every day; now with new reported cases in two additional states, Jonglei and Upper Nile. After the first case was confirmed in Juba four days ago, more than 130 additional cases are now being treated. There are three confirmed deaths. Dozens of children are among the affected.

Since January, UNICEF has warned of the threat of cholera, due to the desperate overcrowding of camps following continued violence, and now the rainy season.  Last month, UNICEF said that unless nutrition treatment is scaled up immediately, up to 50,000 children under the age of five are likely to die.

However, UNICEF in South Sudan urgently needs US$10 million so as to continue current life-saving operations and increase its cholera prevention work.

• Provision of safe water and essential sanitation in the cholera treatment centre and across the country;

   in Juba;

• Provision of temporary wards for both triage and patient care at the cholera treatment centre;

   consistent electricity supply for patient treatment;

UNICEF promotes the rights and wellbeing of every child, in everything we do. Together with our partners, we work in 190 countries and territories to translate that commitment into practical action, focusing special effort on reaching the most vulnerable and excluded children, to the benefit of all children, everywhere.
