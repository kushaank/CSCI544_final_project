Gold futures pared gains to end Monday nearly unchanged as a rebound in U.S. equities tempered investor interest in haven assets.

Gold for June delivery, the most active contract, settled up 40 cents at $1,293.80 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Gold prices had touched $1,305.70 an ounce, their highest level in four days, after U.S. equities pulled back in early morning trading on Monday. But by early afternoon, a rebound in stocks saw gold erase most of the day's gains.

"The market just steadily eroded," said Bill O'Neill, a principal with Logic Advisors in Upper Saddle River, N.J.

Gold and equities often move in opposite directions because investors tend to favor haven assets like precious metals and steer clear of economically sensitive investments like stocks when they worry about growth.

An apparent easing in tensions between Russia and Ukraine also appeared to be undermining gold prices.

On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops at the Ukraine border to return to their bases, according to the Kremlin. Mr. Putin also called for an immediate withdrawal of Kiev's troops from eastern Ukraine.

Still, NATO has seen no significant change in the Russian military buildup along Ukraine's border, according to a NATO military officer.

"The Ukraine seems strictly in the background," Mr. O'Neill said.
