
Following a similar move by the European Union last week, Switzerland has added 15 Russian and Ukrainian names to a list of those with connections to the Ukraine crisis. The goal is to keep them from getting around international sanctions.

On Monday, the economics ministry added 13 individuals and two businesses to its list, bringing the total number of names to 63. The measures will come into force on Tuesday at noon.

The result is that those listed will be unable to forge new business deals with Swiss financial entities, which must report any existing business relations. Also, existing bank accounts will be frozen and those listed will not be allowed to enter Switzerland.

The list includes key figures such as Vyacheslav Viktorovich, the first deputy chief of staff of the presidential administration of Russia. He was responsible for overseeing the political integration of the annexed Ukrainian region of Crimea into the Russian Federation.

Thereâ€™s also Vladimir Pligin, chair of the Duma Constitutional Law Committee, and responsible for facilitating legislation on the annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol into the Russian Federation.

Other notable names are Vladimir Shamanov, commander of the Russian airborne troops, plus Petr Jarosh and Oleg Kozyura, acting heads of the federal migration service offices of Crimea and Sevastopol, respectively.
