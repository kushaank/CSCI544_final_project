
KUALA LUMPUR (May 19): The FBM KLCI rose 3.73 points or 0.2% to post a new record close today following the release of the stronger-than-expected economic figures by Bank Negara Malaysia last Friday.

Malaysia's annual economic growth picked up in the first quarter to its fastest of 6.2% in more than a year, lifted by strong exports and consumer spending.

At market close, the bourse ended at 1887.07, on the back of gains made by heavyweights Tenaga Nasional Bhd, Sime Darby Bhd, and CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. The intra-day high for the exchange was 1889.47.

The exchange saw a total of 2.32 billion shares worth RM2.38 billion done.Â  Gainers outpaced decliners today with 413: 382. Leading the gainers was Lysaght Bhd while the top loser of the day was Dana Infra Nasional.

The KLCI had remained in positive territory the entire day.

Choo Swee Kee, chief investment officers of TA Investment Bhd, told theedgemalaysia.com that some interest is returning to the ASEAN market.

Last week, the KLCI refreshed its record close for two trading days amid the inflow of foreign funds.

He also noted that the ringgit was strengthening against the US dollar due to the stronger GDP data.

Choo said for the short term he expects the market to continue its trend, supported by strong Malaysian GDP growth figures.

Across the Asia Pacific, the Japanese Nikkei fell 0.64% to 14006.44 points while the South Korean Kospi rose 0.08% to 2015.14 points.

Other Southeast Asian markets mostly edged up, shrugging off concerns over China's sluggish growth.
