MIRI: An Indonesian national died after he was stabbed using a sharp object, believed to be ‘badik’, below the navel on Sunday night.

Miri police chief ACP Gan Tian Kee, when contacted yesterday, confirmed receiving a report on the incident.

“The case is being investigated under Section 302 of the Penal Code for murder,” said Gan.

The incident occurred near a stall in Kuala Baram where the deceased, identified as Muhammad Zainul Arifin, 24, was having a drink with a friend around 10pm.

Three men, who were also Indonesians, came a few minutes later and sat at a table near where the deceased was sitting with his friend. Muhammad was later seen walking out of the stall with the three men to an alley a few metres away, where they were seen talking.

Later, he was seen staggering to the stall before collapsing, with blood gushing out of a wound below his navel. He was later taken to Miri Hospital where he died around midnight. Muhammad’s friend was also injured while trying to defuse the situation, and has been treated at Miri Hospital.

The weapon believed to have been used in the fight.

Acting on a report, police managed to nab one of the suspects aged 38 to facilitate their investigation on the case. Two other suspects in their 20s, both Bugis, fled the scene.

It is believed that the fight was motivated by revenge.

Meanwhile, police are on a manhunt for the two suspects.

The suspects are believed to have used a 4WD vehicle to make their escape early yesterday morning as a police report had been lodged by an employee that a 4WD vehicle belonging to his company was taken by force from him by two unidentified men in front of a budget inn in the city centre around 3.50am yesterday.

The employee claimed that cash amounting to RM1,400 was inside the vehicle.
