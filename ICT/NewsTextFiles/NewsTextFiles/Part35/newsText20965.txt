
Cabu City â€“ The lawyer of the Cebu Puericulture Center and Maternity House here denied allegations that their nurses had taped the lips of a baby born in their facility.

Atty. Cornelio Mercado, who represents CPCMH, revealed that the accusations made by the parents of the baby were exaggerated and had affected the work of their nurses.

More than a week since the controversy was publicized, Mercado revealed that their nurses and the hospital were unfairly accused in social media without due process.

Mercado added they had suspicions over the motive of the parents to post the pictures of their baby on the social networking site Facebook.

He revealed that one of the hospital's nurses had informed them that during the incident, they noticed that the baby's parents were taking pictures of other babies at the nursery.

He questioned why there is a need to photograph the other babies and even challenged the baby's parents to submit sworn affidavits and present the cellular phone or the memory card for verification.
