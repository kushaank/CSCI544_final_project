
An Alabama man is accused of urging an 11-year-old Florida girl he called a "hottie" to send naked photos of herself, the Polk County Sheriff's Office announced today.

Kenneth "Bobby" Robert Crisp, 56, of Muscadine, Ala., is a friend of the girl's family and he knew the Lakeland girl was 11, the Sheriff's Office said.

"The girl told her mother she has been talking to Bobby Crisp for the past couple of months, and that he had asked for her phone number so that he could get in touch with their family if he needed to,'' a report from the Sheriff's Office said.

Crisp was arrested on Saturday in Alabama on a Polk County warrant alleging three charges of transmitting harmful material to a minor.

He is being held in the Cleburne County Jail in Alabama and will be extradited to Polk County.

The girl's mother contacted the Sheriff's Office on Friday after finding "suspicious texts and voicemails" from Crisp, a report said.

"Not only were the messages sexually explicit, he also sent messages and left voicemails telling the girl to delete the messages and that he didn't want her mom to find out," the report said.

He called the girl a "hottie," told her he wanted to have a baby and said she was "the only thing that keeps him going," a report said.

He asked several times for naked or semi-naked photos. He also offered to send her naked photos of himself.
