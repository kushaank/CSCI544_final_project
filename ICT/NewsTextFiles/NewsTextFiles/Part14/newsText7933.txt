In America, they have Super Tuesday. Europe is about to have a Super Sunday (May 25), with elections   for the European Parliament taking place across the 28-member EU, ending on May 25. That same Sunday (May 25), Ukraine will be holding a presidential election. The next day (May 26), Egypt will hold its own presidential vote. And then, towards the end of that week, on May 29, President Vladimir Putin’s pet project – the formation of a Eurasian Union – will receive the formal go-ahead with a signing ceremony between Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan.
