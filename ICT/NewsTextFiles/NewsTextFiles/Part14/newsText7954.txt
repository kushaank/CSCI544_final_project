
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday that he has ordered Russian troops to pull out of three towns bordering Ukraine, though NATO members say they see no evidence of the movement.

According to a statement released by the Kremlin, troops that had been performing exercises at the border towns of Rostov, Bryansk ,and Belgorod were ordered to return to their “places of permanent deployment.” It's not clear how many of the approximately 40,000 stationed men were asked to withdraw.
