
Museum of the Rockies’ most anticipated benefit event – the 13th Annual Wine Classic – will take place this year on Saturday, July 12, from 5:30-10:30pm. Tickets are still available.

This year’s theme, Vine to Table, will complement the Museum’s Living History Farm as it celebrates its 25th Anniversary at MOR. All proceeds will benefit the Living History Farm’s programs and operations.

A special live auction item will also be part of this year’s Wine Classic – an opportunity for four people to visit the set of Jurassic World with Jack Horner. The highest bidder, along with three of his or her guests, will travel to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in early August and spend a day on the set with Horner as the Hollywood film crew shoots the final scenes for Jurassic World, the 4th installment of the Jurassic Park films. They’ll get to meet the director, producers and the actors while on the set. Jack Horner has been a contributor and scientific consultant on all of the Jurassic Park movies.

Tickets to this celebrated benefit event are still available – $150 for MOR members, $175 for non-members – and can be purchased by calling 406-994-1998 or online at www.museumoftherockies.org .
