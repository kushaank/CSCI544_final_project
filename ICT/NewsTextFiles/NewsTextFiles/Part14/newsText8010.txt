
McNAIRY COUNTY, Tenn. -- Adamsville chiropractor Matthew Barnes faces charges of aggravated statutory rape of a 14-year-old girl, according to the McNairy County Sheriff's Office.

Sheriff Guy Buck tells WBBJ 7 Eyewitness News he learned of the possible rape on Mother's Day.

"The father of the victim contacted me personally and advised that he believed his daughter had been involved in a sexual relationship with an adult," Sheriff Buck said.

Deputies say the father made the call to the sheriff's office after looking through social media sites and text messages between the two. Deputies say he then began to get suspicious about their relationship.

According to the sheriff's office, the 44 year-old man has offered martial arts and self-defense classes in his home in Stantonville, but didn't say if this is where the sexual acts took place.

"Sunday, we had our sex crime investigator come in to meet with the victim and the mother of the victim, and based on that interview, we did a little bit of leg work and on Monday we were prepared to charge," Sheriff Buck said.

Law enforcement said last Monday night, Barnes was arrested and charged. Deputies say he was then let go on $20,000 bond. Barnes could face up to 15 years behind bars.

Sheriff Buck says the victim's parents want justice to be served.

"I think that they want to see justice for their daughter, and I think that they're trying to use every avenue to bring it to light."

Barnes has not yet faced a preliminary hearing for these charges.
