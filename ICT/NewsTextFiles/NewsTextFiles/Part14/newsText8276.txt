
ROCHESTER, Minn. (KTTC) -- Saturday was a day of pomp and circumstance at Mayo Civic Center as graduates from Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota Rochester received diplomas.

Hundreds attended the Mayo medical and graduate schools' commencement ceremonies at Mayo Civic Center's Presentation Hall.

"I've been waiting for this day for as long as I can remember," said Chika Nwachukwu, a medical school graduate who will soon be attending Harvard. "Since I was in high school, I've always wanted to be a doctor. I'm so happy. Today's been an amazing day."

Fifty-nine physicians and scientists received degrees from Mayo Clinic's College of Medicine and graduate schools, including new mom and doctor, Lindsay Warner of Rochester.

"This little lady is incredibly proud of her mom," said Lindsay's husband, Paul Warner, as he motioned to the couple's six week old daughter.

The University of Minnesota Rochester's class of 2014 also graduated at the Mayo Civic Center on Saturday.

"The emotions will probably hit me a week from now when I don't have any more classes or faculty to talk to, but for now, I'm just living in the moment," said UMR Graduate, Tim Horm.

UMR's graduating class includes 84 students who received degrees in Science and Health, and Biology.
