The West Virginia Regional Jail Authority has announced a series of meetings have been scheduled to allow community leaders to comment on the costs and benefits of the jails.

The meetings are part of the Authority's containment review process.  They are meeting with local  and county officials in the areas that house each of their 10 facilities.  The meetings are planned over the next few months.  The meetings include a roundtable discussion and a tour of the facilities.

"We are bringing together a broad range of people at the local level to discuss a broad range of issues," said Regional Jail Authority Executive Director, Joe DeLong.  "This offers a setting where you can talk about high-level issues like financing, bond funding and setting the per-diem, but also small scale, narrow customer service and relationship issues."

The first meeting has already been held in Logan County.  DeLong said that meeting included local magistrate and circuit court officials and was very productive.  Meetings in the other communities will be held through November 2014.  The next one is set for Raleigh County on June 3 to discuss the Southern Regional Jail.

Meetings like this have traditionally been held in Charleston.  West Virginia's Association of Counties, County Commissioners' Association and Municipal League participated in those discussions.  They helped to promote the ongoing series of regional meetings.
