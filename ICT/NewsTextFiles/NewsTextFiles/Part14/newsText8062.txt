Phillip Eugene Wooten lead police on a chase through North and South Carolina this weekend.

He has a history and faces charges in both states unrelated to the chase. His most recent offense happened in Shelby.

An officer stopped Wooten, 29, for driving without his headlights on. When the officer walked up to the car, he asked Wooten to open the door. Wooten fumbled with the door, so the officer opened it, the report read.

When the officer asked Wooten why he was bleeding, Wooten replied that he'd cut himself with a knife. Wooten gave three knives to the officer, who then asked him to get out of the truck for a weapons check, the report said.

While frisking the man, the officer felt a cylinder near Wooten's waist, which as he checked the underwear area, fell out of the man's pants to the ground, according to the report.

Police later found shards of glass in the truck, and Wooten may have tried to break the glass pipe before he was stopped, the report said, which was the reason Wooten's hands were bleeding when the officer pulled him over.

Police took Wooten to the main jail and charged him with carrying a concealed weapon, possession of drug paraphernalia and failure to burn headlamps.
