
Up to 1,000 children and teens will be detained at Lackland.

SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS (NBC) - The Lackland Air Force Base in Texas is now being used to house children and teenagers caught in the US illegally and alone.

On Sunday, federal officials began housing the undocumented young people at the San Antonio military installation.

They say the additional space is needed due to a record number of kids caught in the US illegally and by themselves.

Up to 1,000 children and teens will be detained at Lackland.

The base was used for the same purpose back in 2012 when the number of children caught crossing the border illegally jumped sharply.
