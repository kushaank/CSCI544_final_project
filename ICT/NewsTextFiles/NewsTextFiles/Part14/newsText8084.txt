
Then leave. Go somewhere else! Stop coming here!

But not really.

Because that’s kind of the idea behind Teleport , a new Andreessen Horowitz-incubated startup from early Skype executive Sten Tamkivi and general partner Balaji Srinivasan.

This company, which was in stealth, put up a small teaser today . The idea is to help the globe’s knowledge workers find the jobs and places that maximize their take-home pay, or the difference between their paychecks and what they spend on housing, food and transport.

I’ve reached out to Tamkivi, and will update when I hear back. They haven’t released any products or services yet, but they’re looking for workers that are interested in relocating.

The gist is to build a sort of “life search” engine that helps mobile workers find the best quality of life based on their pay and interests. If you stretch this thinking out, it could have all sorts of interesting ramifications for global economic development.

Imagine dispersing the tech industry’s talent to many more cities around the U.S. or the world, and what that would mean for the kinds of companies people would start if they were exposed to different living situations or cultures.

The issue is that one of the great paradoxes of modern living is that physical proximity has become more valuable even though technology and transportation have made connections across long distances cheaper . It’s called the Jevons paradox , where efficiency improvements lead to more, not less, consumption of certain goods or services. Improvements in information technology have paradoxically led to more demand for complementary face-to-face contact. And it’s turned out that densely developed cities are far more favorable to knowledge-centric economies.

We’ll have more details on this one. Stay tuned.
