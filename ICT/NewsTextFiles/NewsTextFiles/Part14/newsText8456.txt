
Emily Medalen takes us to the homes of those who hosted rummage sales all weekend, with the story.

Rummage sales were held 3 days in a row for the Ultimate Garage sale weekend - and the event wasn't taken lightly.

(Kalynn and Ashley Hardin) "Whenever we were first setting up, they showed up, like, before we were open, and tried to get the first pick. People take this stuff really seriously."

From clothing, to couches, to retro cacalendarscitizens yard-hopped around town to find trinkets and treasures at a price they couldn't turn down.

(John Ferderer) "Everybody likes to get out and find a good bargain, and you know, if you can get a few pieces of kids clothes for a little bit cheaper, you can't go wrong with finding that bargain."

But these benefit more than just the shoppers - it's also spring cleaning time for many homeowners.

(John Federer) "It's nice to be able to clear out some of the stuff that's just taking up space in the house, and you don't need it anymore."

This year, with hundreds of homes putting out sales, is estimated to have been the biggest one the Magic City has seen.

(Kalynn and Ashley Hardin) "It's been non-stop. Go, go, go, go, go."

And it doesn't look like the tradition is going anywhere, anytime soon.
