
Missouriâ€™s legislative session came to end Friday, and again lawmakers failed to pass Medicaid expansion, frustrating many area health care experts.

Without Medicaid expansion, the state will lose out on $1.13 billion in federal funding to expand the program this year to an additional 300,000 Missourians, according to a University of Missouri report.

It would be â€œan economic stimulus that would have created 24,000 new jobs and saved hundreds of others,â€� said Sidney Watson , a professor at Saint Louis Universityâ€™s School of Law who is also a health law specialist.

Between 2014 and 2020 $8.2 billion in federal funds are available for Missouriâ€™s Medicaid expansion. Missouriâ€™s would have to pay $332 million over that same time period to expand the program, according to the University of Missouri report.

The decision to pass on Medicaid expansion comes at a time when hospitals are receiving less federal funding to provide charity care to those who are unable to pay. A majority of that funding, known as disproportionate share hospital funding, is being re-directed to pay for the expansion of Medicaid in the United States.

Republicans opposed the expansion, fearing that Missouri could be on the hook for more money in future years. And Republicans wanted to reform certain aspects of Medicaid before expanding it.
