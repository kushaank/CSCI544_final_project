
The Lewis County Sheriff is investigating a fatal accident which took place Monday.

According to Sheriff Johnny Bivens, at approximately 6 a.m., a call was received by Lewis County dispatch to respond to an injury accident at the junction of Kentucky 9 and Kentucky 10.

Upon arrival, officers found that a 2014 Chevrolet Impala, operated by 26-year-old Christine Bolder of Chicago, Ill., had pulled out of the Grayson Spur, into the path of a 2001 Peterbuilt tractor trailer, operated by 70-year-old Jimmy Roberts of Maysville, according to Bivens.

The tractor trailer struck the driver's side of the vehicle, which then hit a rock wall, trapping the driver and 38-year-old Marquis McKay, who was a passenger in Bolder's vehicle.

Bolder was transported to Southern Ohio Medical Center in Portsmouth, Ohio, and later to Cabell-Huntington Hospital in Huntington, W. Va., where she was listed in critical condition. McKay was also transported to SOMC, where he succumbed to his injuries.

The driver of the tractor trailer was not injured.

The accident remains under investigation by Deputy Dwayne Stone and Deputy Gary Sparks.

The LCSO was assisted at the scene by the Black Oak Fire Department, the Lewis County Fire Department, Portsmouth Ambulance Service and the Kentucky Department of Highways.
