
On Monday, The Arkansas Highway and Transportation Department will have a public meeting on bike lanes and walking trails. The AHTDÂ  hopes to gather ideas to update the state's master plans.

The master plan hasn't been updated since 1998. Cities and counties throughout the state will use the master plan to make changes in their area. Bike lane and walking trail accessibility will be an area of focus in the meeting.

The meeting will take place Monday at 6 p.m. at the Riverfront Pavilion in Fort Smith. A similar meeting was held in Northwest Arkansas in April.
