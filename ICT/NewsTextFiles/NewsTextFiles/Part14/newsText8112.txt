
The Moberly City Council tentatively has $180,628 in purchases for the Community Development, Public Works and Moberly Fire departments on Monday’s (May 19) second regular meeting agenda of the month.

Ordinances and receipts for bids pertaining to the six buys take up a majority of the agenda’s two-page splay. The purchases come following the city’s announcement at a 2014-15 preliminary budget meeting last Wednesday (May 14) that the city will be using deficit spending (the spending of money already in the city’s possession, such as in a checking or savings account) to provide several capital purchases on the tail end of the amended budget for the 2013-14 fiscal year, to provide relief for the next year’s budget. Moberly City Finance Manager Greg Hodge said at that meeting that he would be meeting with multiple department heads to access needs for the coming year, and how best to use said funds.

The largest purchase amount request Monday night will come through the Public Works Department: three items, totaling $116,502.

The first of these is for $35,760 — a 2014 Cat 236d skid steer loader. The second is a $57,600 2014 Case/IH 125a tractor. The third is a $23,142 60-inch rear boom mower.

The Moberly Fire Department will see $45,047 of Monday’s purchases, requesting $27,147 for three thermal imaging cameras and $17,900 for a stored energy compressed air foam system.

In the amount of $19,079, the Moberly Community Development Department will be seeking approval of a 2014 Ford F-150 half-ton regular cab 4x2 pickup truck.

An appropriations ordinance, a resolution regarding the destruction of certain city documents, and a notice of public hearing on the proposed city tax rate will also be taking place Monday.

Tom McGinty will be recognized for his retirement. Dustin Harrison will be recognized as an Optimist Club Officer of the Year nominee.

Requests will be received from Todd Beaverson and Dennis Hill to hold the annual Independence Day 5K in on July 4, and fro Moberly Area Community College, to close College Ave. from Reed St. to Burkhart St. for the annual Art on the Block event, on June 14.

Department heads will present their monthly reports to the council.

An appointment will be heard for the Moberly Parks and Recreation Board. Consideration of liquor license applications will also be heard, prior to a possible retirement into closed executive session.
