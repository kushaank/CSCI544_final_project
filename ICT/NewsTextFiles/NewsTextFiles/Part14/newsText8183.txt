
Gov. Peter Shumlin, who is running for his third two-year term as governor, likes to tell people that he has yet to start thinking about campaigning, so focused is he on the job of being governor. Before him, Gov. Jim Douglas had the same kind of aw-shucks-what-election demeanor. Just as a whole lot of other incumbents do every election year.

Meanwhile, people around them are raising money hand over fist and seeing to little details like making sure the governor has collected enough voter signatures to get on the ballot.

Two years ago, Shumlin’s deputy chief of staff, Alex MacLean, transitioned out of the governor’s office to run his campaign. This year, MacLean is gone, now working for Jay Peak owner Bill Stenger. It appears that another of the governor’s staffers – Scott Coriell – is doing the hybrid campaign/staff thing. But for the time being, he’s a campaign volunteer.

“Scott has volunteered to gather petition signatures for the governor,” spokeswoman Sue Allen said in response to an inquiry about Coriell’s status. Coriell will also represent Shumlin at any Democratic committee meetings Shumlin is unable to attend, she said.

Allen is still sticking to the campaign-what-campaign line, however. “The governor is very glad to have Scott as a member of his team on the fifth floor and won’t make any further personnel decisions about the campaign until it gets underway,” she said.

Coriell is a former staffer with Rep. Peter Welch and the brother of David Coriell, who worked for Douglas.
