
This month marks the 60th anniversary of the Brown vs. Board of Education Supreme Court decision , initiating efforts to integrate schools around the country and especially in the American South where black and white children received largely unequal opportunities for education.

In Arkansas's capital city beginning in the early 1950's, housing policies led to effective racial discrimination, as several African-American neighborhoods were identified as “slums,” demolished and gradually moved to the eastern part of the city while white communities shifted to the west.

...the city’s most decisive response to Brown v. Board of Education was in fact the pre-emptive strategy of slum clearance and urban redevelopment in the early 1950s rather than the massive resistance of the later 1950s. Without doubt, this policy shaped race relations in the city more fundamentally over the long-term, even up to the present day, than the short-term effects of the school crisis.
