
TUCSON (AP) — Trampoline parks around Arizona have been working to meet new regulations since a state law regulating their safety passed last month, the Arizona Daily reported.

The state’s nine trampoline parks have 90 days to comply with the new requirements.

Trampoline parks, which have grown in popularity, must now register with the Arizona Department of Fire Building and Life Safety and show proof of a minimum $1 million bodily injury insurance. The law mandates the department keep a database of all trampoline courts. The agency is required to make available to the public a company’s proof of insurance, emergency calls made to the business and inspection certificates.

The department can shut down any park that fails to meet these criteria.

ASTM International, formerly American Society for Testing and Materials, set up industry standards for trampoline parks last year. But Reed said that states outlining standards is also important.

Coleman said the new law also protects trampoline parks that are satisfying safety standards from negligence claims.

Arvie Webster, a trauma program manager at the University of Arizona Medical Center, said 11 people have been treated for trampoline-related injuries since January 2013. One patient ended up with a broken neck and broken legs while jumping at one of Tucson’s two trampoline parks, Webster said. He called the new law “a start” and that parks need better supervision.

Visitors under the law will bear some responsibility. Anyone under the influence of alcohol or drugs or with a certain health condition won’t be able to go jumping.
