Jasmine Mitchell went to Birmingham on Saturday with a goal, and she came back as one of the four grand prize winners in the teen division of the Alabama Talent Hunt.

Out of about 35 total entrants in all divisions, 15 were in the teenage division.

Mitchell, a junior at Etowah High School, sang “House of the Rising Sun” for her performance.

“I wouldn’t have changed anything that I did that night,” she said.

Her experience was made even more special since three of her best friends from Etowah High School — Madie Bishop, Amari Bell and Lauren Hood — made signs supporting her and traveled to be in the audience.

“When I finished singing, they started holding up the signs and cheering for me,” Mitchell said.

As a grand prize winner, Mitchell will perform on a CD produced by the Alabama Talent Hunt called “Alabama’s Emerging Artists 2014,” which will be released on iTunes. She also will receive a one-year development contract with Alabama Talent Company.
