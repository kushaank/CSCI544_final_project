
The five-year trash hauling contract with J.P. Mascaro & Sons, and future alternatives to the contract, were discussed by the Lower Providence Board of Supervisors May 15.

Gestrich said the supervisors talked about several issues including changing the contract to private haulers, two times a week collections, one time a week pickup, a potential senior citizen discount and per-bag collections.

The Lower Providence-based trash hauler won the five-year contract in late 2009 with a low bid of $400.20 per year per household. The contract runs from 2010 to February 2015.

Gestrich reviewed four financial proposals received by the township to finance the road repaving program for up to three years.

DelVal Business Finance Corp. of Philadelphia submitted the apparent low bid proposal to loan funds at 2.080 percent interest with a 10-year payback period, Gestrich said. The road repaving bids will be received later this month and the supervisors may award the bid for this year’s program at the June 5 meeting.

DelVal provided different finance options for a $443,000 paving program this year, $1,005,260 for 2014 and 2015 and $1,508,466 for three years.

It is likely the supervisors will award the road repaving contract and approve a financing package at the June 5 meeting, he said.
