
During the administration of former Gov. Bob McDonnell, regulations were established for abortuaries to make them live up to minimum standards for free-standing surgical clinics.

Virginia Society for Human Life spokeswoman Olivia Gans Turner says Gov. McAuliffe was supported by pro-abortion supporters during his campaign, and he is making good on campaign promises.

"Here we see Gov. McAuliffe giving back to the hardcore pro-abortion lobby that so effectively worked to get him elected in the fall," she says, arguing that McAuliffe is protecting the abortion industry at the expense of women's health and safety.

What Gov. McAuliffe is also trying to do is to add five new members to the Virginia Board of Health to review the clinic regulations, which were approved by legislators in 2011. The board has 15 members total.

"One of the individuals that he's seeking to put back on is notorious in his opposition to the clinic regulations," says Turner. "He was vocal during the initial process and remains so, and was one of only two votes opposing the final implementation of the clinic regs a year ago."

Turner has told OneNewsNow before there are Virginia clinics that would not be able to meet the basic safety standards and would have to close if they are enforced.
