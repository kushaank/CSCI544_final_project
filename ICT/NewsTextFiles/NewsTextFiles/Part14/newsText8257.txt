
Now that the great nasal strip debate of 2014 is officially behind us, we can focus solely on the actual horse racing as California Chrome prepares to become the first Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978.

California Chrome flashed dominant closing speed at both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness and appears primed to make history. All that stands in his way of immortality in the horse racing world is one more race—the daunting Belmont Stakes.

This horse, what he's doing for two guys that work their butts off to put beans and bacon on the table, this horse has given everyone out there incentive to say, 'You know what? We can do it, too.' … It may not be a horse race. It may be the idea that they have in their head or a new product or whatever the case may be, but we just hope that this horse is letting Americans know that the little guy can win.

Lucky number 13? California Chrome is 13th horse to win both Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes since last Triple Crown in 1978.

Commanding Curve, Samraat, Danza, Ride On Curlin and Social Inclusion are some of the strongest horses in the sport. Most of them ran in the loaded Kentucky Derby field, and Social Inclusion matched California Chrome stride for stride for much of the Preakness.

What’s more, a lot of the horses that ran at the Derby didn’t run at the Preakness, so they should be much fresher than California Chrome.

Still, we are talking about a dominant horse with a jockey who appears more than comfortable riding him. In fact, Victor Espinoza has won six straight atop California Chrome and was nearly flawless in his execution at the Preakness.
