
Floodwater triggered more than 3,000 landslides across the Balkans Sunday. Entire towns and villages have been destroyed and land mines have even been disturbed. American Red Cross organizations in the region are trying to help, but say their supplies are low.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies or IFRC are reporting thousands of people in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina are still waiting to be rescued from Flooded homes. It says it's one of the worst floods to happen in the area in more than a century. A state of emergency has been issued for 14 municipalities.

Sakib Hadzic, who was born in Bosnia and now lives in Jacksonville said he's heartbroken seeing his home country suffering. He's lived in Jacksonville since 1996 but home is where the heart is.

â€œIt's heartbreaking, it's sad. I've looked at the last few days and it's nothing that I have ever seen and I'm 30. I wish we could do something more to help them out over there. It's just really sad," said Hadzic.

Hadzic has a friend living in Bosnia now. He said he's has never seen anything like this.

Right now, the Serbia Red Cross, along with the Red Cross Society of Bosnia are helping out in the affected area with food, water and evacuation. Hundreds of people are taking to the American Red Cross's Facebook page asking it to help out.

"I watched today that a couple other countries have helped out already from Austria to other countries that have sent help already," said Hadzic.

He says there's a big Bosnian population here in Jacksonville.

"They're definitely affected, there's a lot of people here and all they can do is watch and hope it gets better," he said.
