
LOUISVILLE, Ky. (May 19, 2014) — With final stages of a $44 million renovation nearly complete, Kentucky Kingdom amusement park in Louisville is set to reopen May 24, the start of Memorial Day weekend.

Kentucky Kingdom’s Hurricane Bay waterpark will be open seven days a week from Memorial Day weekend through Aug. 13.

With 20 new rides and attractions among a total of more than 50, Kentucky Kingdom and its award-winning Hurricane Bay waterpark will be open seven days a week from Memorial Day weekend through Aug. 13. Kentucky Kingdom remains open during the Kentucky State Fair (Aug.14-24) and then celebrates Labor Day weekend and continues operating weekends through the end of September.

Among new rides at the 63-acre theme park adjacent to the Kentucky Exposition Center is Lightning Run, a steel roller coaster that was recently featured on CNN. Lightning Run, one of three coasters at the park, is recognized for its signature 100-foot drop at a nearly perpendicular angle.

“It’s fast, it’s exhilarating,” said John Mulcahy, the park’s communications and marketing director.

Hurricane Bay has doubled in size, adding 10 new water attractions including a family lagoon wave pool, a triple slide tower complex, a family raft ride, an interactive play area for toddlers, as well as the region’s first adventure river and a triple-bump slide. The new Deep Water Dive is North America’s tallest body slide at more than 12 stories tall.

Thunder Run is a wooden roller coaster with nearly 3,000 linear feet of track and a 74-foot drop.

Management of Kentucky Kingdom, which closed in 2009, projects attendance will return to more than 1 million visitors within three years as the park adds even more rides, including three more coasters. 2015 plans include the reopening of a renovated 5,000-seat amphitheater for special events and concerts.

More than 60 food stands and restaurants will serve barbecue, pizza and other dishes, with catering available for groups ranging from 50 to 7,500 diners per serving, Mulcahy said.

General admission at the gate costs $44.95, with a $34.95 discounted rate for children, seniors and military. Season passes are available online for $99.95 or at Kroger stores for $69.95.
