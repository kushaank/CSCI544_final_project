
A University of Colorado Boulder physiology laboratory conducting research to improve locomotion for lower limb amputees, including military service veterans, is being featured nationally as part of 2014 Veterans Affairs Research Week May 19-23.

CU-Boulder’s Applied Biomechanics Lab, a VA-approved facility run by Grabowski within the Denver VA Eastern Colorado Healthcare System, conducts research to understand the implementation and effects of powered and passive leg prostheses. The national poster for VA Research Week May 19-23 features a veteran running across the CU-Boulder campus wearing a running-specific leg prosthesis as he warms up for a study in Grabowski’s lab on how running-specific prostheses affect sprint performance.

For the first time in history, people with lower limb amputations have regained near-normal function during level walking due to the development of a powered, ankle-foot prosthesis, said Grabowski, a faculty member in CU-Boulder’s integrative physiology department. Her team is conducting the VA research with a unique prosthesis called the BiOM, developed by Personal Bionics in Bedford, Mass., which helps restore natural gait, balance and speed, and lowers joint stress.

Grabowski’s Applied Biomechanics Lab, which includes about a dozen people, is funded in part by a five-year Career Development Award to her from the Department of Veterans Affairs Rehabilitation, Research and Development Service. The VA allocated funds for Grabowski to establish a state-of-the-art gait laboratory that includes a dual-belt treadmill, a high-speed treadmill, an eight-camera motion analysis system, sophisticated metabolic analysis machines and two powered ankle-foot prostheses and more than 60 running-specific prostheses.

She also is funded by the DOD’s Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs.

Grabowski collaborates with a number of institutions on her research, including MIT, Brown University, The Orthopedic Specialty Hospital in Murray, Utah, and Colorado School of Mines.
