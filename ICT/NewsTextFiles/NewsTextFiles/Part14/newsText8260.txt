
See paintings come to life during the Bruce Museum’s unique driving tour of Connecticut, an exciting part of its new exhibition Pasture to Pond: Connecticut Impressionism.

Museum-goers will be provided with a guided driving tour, which includes a map of scenes around Connecticut which are featured in some of the Impressionist paintings currently on view. This new foray into the Museum’s use of the Guide by Cell system looks to continue the experience beyond the exhibition and outside the Museum’s doors.

The driving tour complements the Bruce Museum’s Pasture to Pond: Connecticut Impressionism exhibition, and offers museum-goers an additional way to experience the exhibition’s beautiful subjects. The tour begins at the Bruce Museum and ends at Greenwich Point Park, highlighting five different locations over a distance of about 12 miles.

Active driving time is approximately 30 minutes. The guide and map will be available in the gallery to exhibition participants, as well as on the Museum’s website at Brucemuseum.org . All of the Museum’s Guide by Cell programs are generously underwritten by Nat and Lucy Day. The exhibit will be on display through June 22.

The Bruce Museum is located at One Museum Drive.
