
The DOT is preparing to bid the first phase of the Zoo Interchange core's reconstruction.

The Wisconsin Department of Transportation will spend a combined $13.5 million in its deal to settle the lawsuit challenging the Zoo Interchangeâ€™s reconstruction.

The specific Milwaukee-area bus routes that the money will pay for still must be developed, according to a DOT announcement. The settlement includes $11.5 million to finance routes for four years, and $2 million to create real-time transit route information and encourage people to ride the bus routes.

Milwaukee County is earmarked to get $2,875,000 , according to a Milwaukee County report. One route identified Monday in a Milwaukee County report would carry workers in Milwaukeeâ€™s central city to the Park Place Business Park on the cityâ€™s far northwest side and the Menomonee Falls industrial park. That route, to start in August, will cost $245,000 this year and $668,000 in 2015.

The Wisconsin DOT negotiated the settlement with Milwaukee Inner-City Congregations Allied for Hope and the Black Health Coalition of Wisconsin. Those organizations sued the state in August 2012 to challenge the $1.7 billion Zoo Interchange reconstruction plan because it does not include any improvements to public transit.

The state last year started reconstruction of streets surrounding the Zoo Interchange, and this fall will begin major reconstruction of the Interchangeâ€™s core ramps. The project is to be complete by the end of 2018.
