Metra trains on the UP-W line were briefly stopped in both directions during Monday's afternoon commute after an incident between Maywood and River Forest.

Inbound train #52 was scheduled to arrive in Chicago at 3:50 p.m. The train struck a pedestrian around 3:25 p.m. near 1st Avenue and the Des Plaines River Bridge. That train- and all others- were stopped for about half an hour.

Outbound Metra Train #39 was held at Ogilvy.
