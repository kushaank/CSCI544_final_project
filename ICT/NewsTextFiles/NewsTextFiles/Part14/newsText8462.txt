At 12 p.m. sharp, news broke that the state of Oregon ended the ban of gay marriage. Outside of the U.S. District Court Clerk on 8th and Ferry street in Eugene, couples and activists alike celebrated the news with hugs, kisses and tears of joy. Quickly after, couples headed to the Lane County Courthouse down the street at 8th and Oak to begin lining up to receive their marriage licenses. About 50 couples were already waiting after the ruling, and the court began granting same-sex marriages at 1 p.m.

* LGBT’s are not a race, color, ethnicity, nationality, religion or gender. It is a chosen sexual perverted lifestyle. If you like or believe in doing something ugly, and others do not accept your behavior or refuse to associate with it.

How are others denying your freedom? You are free to be a degenerate sexual pervert if you want, but do not expect others to accept you as anything but a degenerate sexual pervert.

You should do some more reading, outside of World Nut Daily, The Blaze, and The American Family Association.  LGBT is on part with all of the other unchangeable characteristics of human nature.  This has been thoroughly demonstrated in psychology and continues to be demonstrated with each new discovery in biology.  As for you, you’re free to be a hateful, spiteful bigot, but do not expect the rest of society to go along with your game plan.

Even though the LGBT’s have forcefully advanced there immoral perverted lifestyle, it does not reflect the values of the majority. These freaks are a relatively small portion of humanity. If you approve of, sanction, encourage and accept sodomy and perverted sex, that is your right. I think these freaks of nature and morality are disgusting and do not want to be around them and that is my right.
