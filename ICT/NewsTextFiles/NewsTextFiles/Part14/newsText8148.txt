
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) maintains a significant lead over his primary challenger but is in a statistical dead heat with Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes for November, a new poll suggests.

Just over a third support Matt Bevin, a businessman backed by the Tea Party, who will face McConnell in the GOP primary on Tuesday.

Three other Republican candidates split 5 percent of the vote, and 5 percent said they were undecided.

A majority of registered Republicans, the poll found, said they agree with Bevin’s argument that McConnell hasn’t done enough to stop ObamaCare or cut federal spending.

McConnell’s Senate campaign also circulated a memo Monday in advance of Tuesday’s primary, laying out reasons why he is in a position to win.

The memo said McConnell has maintained a slight lead ahead of Grimes in 7 out of 11 polls released in 2014.

The poll, a mix of automated calls and live-caller cellphone calls, surveyed 2,000 adults between May 14 and May 16, and has a margin of error of 4 percentage points.
