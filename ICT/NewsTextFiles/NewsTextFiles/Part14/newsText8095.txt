
PETERBOROUGH — A police officer used a Taser to subdue an unruly man at the Big Apple convenience store on Sunday evening.

Police Chief Scott Guinard said officers Ashley Pepelis and Martin Kolb went to the store at about 7:50 p.m., after getting a call about two men inside whose loud behavior and profane language had alarmed store clerks and customers.

Guinard said the officers spoke to the men and asked them to calm down. One man, David Truglia, 28, of Cutchogue, N.Y., cooperated and he was arrested without incident on a charge of disorderly conduct.

The second man, Brett Keller, 28, of Riverhead, N.Y., continued to yell and scream. Guinard said Keller resisted after being told he was being placed under arrest and Pepelis used her Taser to control him.

Keller was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. He was released on $2,500 personal recognizance, with a court date in 8th Circuit Court, Jaffrey, on June 30.

Truglia was charged with disorderly conduct. He was also released on $2,500 personal recognizance with a June 30 court date.

Guinard said a number of customers and workers inside the store witnessed the arrests and the store’s security cameras also recorded the incident.
