
Seminole County will likely euthanize a dog named Fidelis that bit a 24-year-old waitress Saturday evening at an Outback Steakhouse restaurant in Oviedo.

The owner of the American Staffordshire terrier, Michelle Lynn Barabas, 25, surrendered the dog to Seminole County Animal Services after the incident for a required 10-day quarantine period during which the animal will be watched for signs of rabies.

After the quarantine period expires May 27, the 2-year-old dog "more than likely" will be euthanized, said Bob Hunter, Seminole County's animal services director.

"It's an unfortunate situation," he said. "Typically we don't adopt out 'bite' dogs."

Barabas and Joshua Saroka, both of Oviedo, were sitting together at an outdoor table at the restaurant on Mitchell Hammock Road when a waitress, Maegan Rose McFarland, bent down to set a bowl of water in front of Fidelis. The dog then lunged forward and bit McFarland on the right hand, according to an Oviedo police report.

Paramedics bandaged the waitress' hand and she told them she would get stitches for the wounds if needed.

Elizabeth Watts, an Outback spokeswoman, said the waitress has returned to work and "is going to be OK."

Oviedo allows dogs in any public place as long as the animals are leashed.

Florida was the first in the nation to enact a law allowing dogs in outdoor areas of restaurants.

The "doggie dining" bill, which was sponsored by former state Rep. Sheri McInvale, an Orlando Republican, went into effect July 1, 2006.

It required restaurants to apply for permits to designate outdoor seating areas and carry liability insurance.

Before Fidelis chomped the waitress, Barabas told another woman the dog did not like her standing over him, the report said.
