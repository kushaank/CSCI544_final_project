
Taylor Swift wows in a cute red dress as she arrives at the gym in New York City on Monday morning (May 19).

The 24-year-old musician recently opened up to People mag about her cat, Meredith, attacking her MET Gala gown.

“I’ve never seen more fashionable people lose their composure quicker than when a cat walks up to a satin, custom Oscar de la Renta gown and then decides to make a home inside of it,” Taylor shared.

Thankfully, there was no damage whatsoever.
