The charges against Mays include operating a vehicle while intoxicated, possession of marijuana, no proof of insurance and refusal to be fingerprinted.

The councilman said last month that he might handle his own defense in the case, and said today, May 19, that's what he intends to do.

Just last week, Mays also acted as his own attorney in a civil lawsuit that sought to stop the demolition of the Genesee Towers.

Genesee Circuit Judge Geoffrey Neithercut instead granted the city of Flint's motion for summary judgement of the complaint.

Mays said today that he's served a subpoena, calling for emergency manager Darnell Earley to appear as a witness in the case against him.

Earley, Mayor Dayne Walling and Council President Scott Kincaid asked for Mays to resign in December, the month after his arrest.

The councilman, also a candidate for state House of Representatives, has said Earley's decision to ask him to resign could have an impact on the jury pool.

MLive-The Flint Journal could not immediately reach special prosecutor Michael J. Gildner for comment on the case today.
