Harold was born in Independence, Kan. to Lee and Blanche (Moore) Downing. After a stint in the Army, he obtained his degree from Emporia State Teachers College. In 1953 he married Beverly VanWinkle and they had 58 wonderful years together before her death in 2010. They had three children. He worked at the Kansas State Home and Training Center in Parsons, Kan. until 1966 when he moved his family to Fort Collins so that he could be one of the first two school psychologists hired by Poudre R-1 School District. He earned his Master's Degree from the University of Northern Colorado. He cared greatly for the many students that he met with and their families and learned Spanish so that he could communicate better. He served in this position until his retirement.

Harold's greatest joys were riding his bicycle around Fort Collins and spending time with his family. He especially loved family dinners and often took the entire family to his favorite restaurant, Country Buffet. He had a great sense of humor and loved a good joke.  He was an excellent and much-loved father, grandfather and great-grandfather. He also loved watching the Rockies and the Broncos on television.

He is preceded in death by his wife, his parents, his two brothers, Jack and Forrest; his two sisters, Neva and Anita. He is survived by his three children, Lorraine Wright (Gary Trujillo), Randy Downing, Liz Downing (Brion Rohrbacher); three grandsons, Jason, Daniel and Patrick Wright; two great grandsons, Odin and Eddie Wright and several nieces and nephews.

The family wishes to thank the staff at Fort Collins Heath Care, and especially his nurse, Tessa, for the attentive, loving care given to Harold during the time he lived there.
