
The California High-Speed Rail Authority will be holding a series of public meetings in Southern California this week to talk about the alignment of the future Los Angeles-to-San Francisco train. These will be the first public meetings hosted by the Authority in two years.

In particular, the Authority is trying to figure out the route of the train along the 60-mile Palmdale to Los Angeles segment.

“We are inviting the public and the media to attend these meetings to get the latest update on the high-speed rail project in their neighborhoods,” spokeswoman Adeline Yee wrote in an email.

The meetings will run from 5-8 p.m. The public can learn about the project and ask questions. Comments will be included in the alignment alternatives portion of the Draft Environmental Impact Report and Environmental Impact Statement.

At 6:30 p.m. the authority will give a presentation, Yee wrote.

On Tuesday, the authority will meet at the San Fernando Regional Pool Facility, 208 Park Ave., San Fernando, CA 91340.

On Wednesday, the meeting will take place at Union Station in downtown Los Angeles in the Fred Harvey Room, 800 N. Alameda St.

On May 29, at the Chimbole Cultural Center, 38350 Sierra Highway, Palmdale, CA, 93550.

An additional meeting was added for June 5 at William S. Hart Regional Park, 24151 Newhall Ave., Newhall, CA 91321.

The project is expected to cost about $67.6 billion. It received approval from California voters in November 2008 and has a completion date of 2028.
