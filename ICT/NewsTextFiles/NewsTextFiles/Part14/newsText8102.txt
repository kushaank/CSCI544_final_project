
Motorists traveling south bound on GA 400 can stay on the freeway and avoid surface streets now that the connector to 85 North is open.

The flyover ramps provide a smooth transition from Georgia 400 south to Interstate 85 north, and vice versa â€“ and they are supposed to take as many as 6,000 cars off of the old route that includes Sidney Marcus Boulevard, the station adds.

WXIA's Jerry Carnes reports that after being open one month, the Georgia Department of Transportation counted 519 cars on one ramp over a 2-hour period, while more than 6,000-thousand cars were on Sidney Marcus.
