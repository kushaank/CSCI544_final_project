
A 22-year-old man has told police that he didn't realize he'd been shot at a bar until he left with a friend this weekend.

Hector Aguayofuentes, of Providence, Rhode Island, was shot in the leg early on Saturday at D'Noche Cafe, a nightclub with a history of gun violence.

Mr Aguayofuentes told police that he was leaving the bar with a friend Samuel Hernandez, 27, shortly after 1am when they both noticed he was bleeding.

They went to Hernandez's house but were unable to stop the bleeding. He was eventually taken to a Rhode Island hospital, and police were notified, according to the Providence Journal.

Police say Aguayofuentes hasn't provided any other details or explained how he might have been shot.

D'Noche Cafe had its liquor license suspended and was fined $4,000 after a fight led to shooting outside the bar in February, according to the Providence Journal.

The bar owners were ordered to hire a police detail. D'Noche Cafe also had its license suspended last years following a double shooting after a fight in the bar.
