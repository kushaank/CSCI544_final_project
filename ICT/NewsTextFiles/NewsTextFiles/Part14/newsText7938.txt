
HAMPTONBURGH >> Orange County resident Orysia Dmytrenko is heading to Ukraine, the country where her parents were born, to be one of the international election observers for the presidential and local elections this coming weekend.

This will be her second time serving as an international election observer, having performed the same role 10 years ago.

Dmytrenko was in Ukraine during the unrest in the Crimea area just months ago. She said feels a special bond to the country and its people but also feels lucky that her parents moved to the United States, where she was born.

Dmytrenko will be deployed as part of a team to the eastern part of Ukraine, where there has been recent unrest by separatists, backed by Russia, who are attempting to destabilize the interim government in Kiev.
