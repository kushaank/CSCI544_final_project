FAIRBANKS — About 400 Fairbanks frequent fliers have registered for a TSA express lane since it opened in February at Fairbanks International Airport, a number the agency wants to increase.

Since 2011, the federal agency has been building a network of TSA Pre-Check express security lines. Qualifying passengers, including those who pass an $85 background check, get to board a plane after a pre-9/11 style screening that allows them to leave their shoes on their feet and their laptops in their bags. The background check is good for five years. The express lane is also open to members of the military and children younger than 12 of qualified passengers.

Anchorage joined the TSA Pre-Check club in 2012 and Fairbanks started in February with a dedicated line at the airport and a contractor office near Fred Meyer West that takes fingerprints for the background check.

screening one quarter of passengers through expedited processes, said TSA regional spokeswoman Lorie Dankers, who was in Fairbanks promoting the program Thursday. The agency now screens 1.8 million people daily.

The Fairbanks office is open Wednesday or Thursday at the MorphoTrust USA fingerprinting office above Taco Azteca on Airport Way.

Ted Stevens International Airport in Anchorage and Fairbanks International Airport are the only Alaska airports with dedicated lines for TSA Pre-Check security lanes. At smaller airports there’s no dedicated line, but approved passengers can still go through security without removing their shoes or belts. In her pitch for the program in Fairbanks, Dankers said it’s worth noting that the difference between Pre-Check and regular boarding lines may be more notable in airports outside Alaska.
