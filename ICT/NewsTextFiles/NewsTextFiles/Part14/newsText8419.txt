California Chrome won again.

The three stewards at Belmont Park ruled unanimously on Monday that the chestnut colt can wear a nasal strip in his quest for horse racing’s  first Triple Crown in 36 years.

On Sunday morning, the day after capturing the Preakness Stakes, trainer Art Sherman threatened to keep the colt out of the June 7 Belmont Stakes if California Chrome was not allowed to wear the strip that allows him to breathe better.

The New York stewards — Stephen Lewandowski, representing the New York State Gaming Commission; Dr. Ted Hill, who represents the Jockey Club; and Braulio Baeza Jr., who represents the New York Racing Association — made their decision after consulting with Scott Palmer, the commission’s equine medical director.

Now, New York will join all the other racing jurisdictions that allow their use, including Kentucky and Maryland, where the Derby and the Preakness, respectively, are run.

Finger Lakes Race Track in western New York, is now also considering permitting nasal strips. All harness tracks in New York allow them.

California Chrome is expected to ship from Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore early Tuesday and arrive around noon at Belmont Park, where he will prepare for the Belmont Stakes in his quest to become racing’s 12th Triple Crown winner.

In 2012, trainer Doug O’Neill was told I’ll Have Another couldn’t wear the nasal strip when going for the Triple Crown, but the issue became irrelevant when the horse was injured the day before the race and was retired.
