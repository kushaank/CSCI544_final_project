
The drama in Ukraine is far from the finale â€“ as the country stands on the brink of civil war, Russia and the West are stirring up the rhetoric. But while politicians blame each other, money still plays a key role in worldly affairs. What will the Ukrainian crisis mean for the worldâ€™s finances? Wonâ€™t the US-proposed sanctions be the last straw for the already weakened world economy? To find this out, Sophie is joined by investment banker and financial advisor Jack Worthington on SophieCo.

Jack Worthington: I think that they are failing in isolating Russia because not many people are going to go along with these types of sanctions: the Europeans have too much to lose. Too high stakes for Europe, theyâ€™ve got their own internal red line that I believe theyâ€™ve drawn. I donâ€™t think they are prepared to cross it, I believe it poses an existential threat to the eurozone â€“ so the US doesnâ€™t have much skin in this game, therefore they are going to be more bellicose and more militaristic in these sanctions.

JW: Oh, I donâ€™t think so, not in my experience, not given my experience working all over the world since 1997. I donâ€™t think these sanctions are going to have much effect, especially when Russia has the friends that they do. I think theyâ€™ve got this gas contract coming up with China, they are very close with China. I donâ€™t believe itâ€™s going to negatively impact in a significant way. Again, I donâ€™t believe Europe is going to follow the US in these sanctions for certain key reasons. They are going to have their own internal red line on the turf, and I donâ€™t think they are going to cross it.

JW: Well I think this: I think that the US runs the risk of alienating China. Youâ€™ve got to consider the broader picture: who are Russiaâ€™s friends? The US, through some of its activities over the past decade, has isolated itself, and this does not add to the US at all; this is something that negatively affects the US into the future. I think itâ€™s a foolish move for the US to pursue this line of aggression towards Russia. I think itâ€™s going to backfire, thatâ€™s my own personal opinion.

JW: No, no. I was talking about long-term. Iâ€™m saying that I believe that this was basically a US-orchestrated attempt to destabilize Vladimir Putin personally, by organizing this coup, by orchestrating this thing. Youâ€™ve got a moral obligation to stay involved, and again, after the chaos, after everything, after the dust settles, youâ€™ve got to be in there, and, I think, clearly, youâ€™ve got to be financially supporting the new regime, whatever it may be. Youâ€™ve got a vested interest now in supporting a successful Ukraine, and thatâ€™s going to be very difficult given the previous experience that country has had, as we know, especially, if itâ€™s a divided country. And youâ€™re talking only about the west. The west have the less economically prosperous part of Ukraine; if that is the remnant that they are going to have to support, I think itâ€™s going to be exceedingly difficult, and I believe that is at the heart of some of this bellicose rhetoric we hear coming out from US and Germany.

JW: Well, no, Iâ€™ve heard that rumor as well. I think thatâ€™s a likely scenario â€“ I mean itâ€™s not something that we know for certain, but thatâ€™s its intent â€“ this is a secret kind of covert operation, the US has used these kinds of tactics in other areas of the world, so it makes no surprise that they are doing this in Ukraine.

JW: Again, I think you need to follow the money here. In my perspective you need to follow the money, and the EU. Germany in particular has its hands full with the failing economies of southern Europe. The eurozone is still at risk, so if you bring in a failing Ukraine, letâ€™s say you bring western Ukraine, the remnant of this country is the western side of Ukraine, youâ€™re talking about a perpetually failed state that youâ€™re going to support financially ad infinitum. So again, I think itâ€™s important to follow the money. You know, this is not turning out the way, I think, the US intended it to, and people are trying to put humpy-dumpy back again the best way that we can â€“ I think itâ€™s a monetary issue, I think Germany doesnâ€™t want another Greece on its hands.

JW: Well, I think we are talking about egos at this point. I think weâ€™re talking about issues other than practical â€“ issues that are difficult to resolve. I think Russia has made some good proposals. I think the idea of a neutral Ukraine, one thatâ€™s not aligned with NATO, where it is politically balanced â€“ I think that makes a lot of sense for both Russia and the US. I think the US ought to understand that. I believe that if a similar situation happened on the US borders â€“ letâ€™s say, Mexico, for example â€“ I donâ€™t think that the US would sit back and take it lightly if there was a hostile enemy on their border. I think Americans should understand that, and I think they do, so I do see a way out of this crisis, but itâ€™s going to take clear heads.

JW: Absolutely. I think itâ€™s a tragedy. I think weâ€™re dealing with a propaganda war as well. So, youâ€™re talking about the covert war with Academy, or Blackwater, whoever, and I do believe that there is a significant propaganda war thatâ€™s going on right now. Clearly, absolutely, I see it. I have to review the press from a dozen countries every day to get a true indication of what is going on in our world, and Iâ€™m disappointed, and I think propaganda, as we see, backfires eventually, I think the citizens of the former Soviet Union would understand that concept: when the propaganda you are getting from the mainstream media doesnâ€™t...with the reality, which you see on the street, then I think it backfires eventually, and it is disappointing, Sophie.

JW: This is the way it works. I hate to be so cynical, but what is our vice presidentâ€™s son doing involved with such a high-profile gas situation in Ukraine, given the situation with Germany â€“ some of those issues Germany is dealing with, Gazprom, et cetera â€“ I think itâ€™s bad idea, itâ€™s unfortunate, but it happens.

JW: You know, typically, weâ€™ve been a more moderate country, in my opinion, that we are today. You know, thatâ€™s one of the problems that weâ€™re seeing playing out in Ukraine right now. In the US we donâ€™t have that many economic ties with Russia, so we donâ€™t have the breaks on war, like, letâ€™s say, Germany would â€“ you know, Germany is much more divided on this issue, I think the public opinion in Germany is pretty much evenly split, 50/50, Russia foe or friend. They are the breaks, they are the de-facto breaks on this, letâ€™s call it, military activity â€“ you canâ€™t call it anything else. The US doesnâ€™t have those same kind of breaks, so unfortunately, I think, economic integration between the US and Russia in the future is very important. I believe that trade and globalization are important for that key issue.

JW: Look, as far as Visa and MasterCard leaving Russia permanently, on a permanent basis, because of this temporary political situation â€“ I can give you my perspective, as being involved in corporate strategic planningâ€¦at the corporate level we donâ€™t really think that way, we think longer term about the markets that we enter. I mean, weâ€™ve entered some of the worldâ€™s most volatile markets in my past, and we donâ€™t think about temporary dips and swings in politics and sanctions and issues like this, so I donâ€™t believe that any organization that has a long-term intention, a strategic intent to be in Russia will make a long term decision based upon what I believe is a temporary setback.

SS: In the whole Ukrainian turmoil.

SS: Yeah, yeah.

JW: No, I donâ€™t believe, considering the economic situation, I donâ€™t believe that that was their primary intent, I believe that when they went in Ukraine, it was politically motivated. I donâ€™t think they were considering the long-term ramifications, and I certainly donâ€™t think that they anticipated the industrially productive east breaking up the way that it has â€“ it seems to me like there was a fundamental lack of understanding about the basic nature of Ukraine, how you have the West and the East that are profoundly different, itâ€™s a very divided nation. To me this was an investable outcome of that kind of event, for that kind of activity. But, I believe it was more politically motivated than financially, to begin with.

JW: I think its economy can be saved by having a unified Ukraine. You know, one issue, Sophie, that I take issue with, is the characterization of the people in eastern Ukraine as always being pro-Russian, okay? They are always characterized as being pro-Russian, but thatâ€™s not necessarily the case. These people are favorable to Russia, but it doesnâ€™t mean that they are pro-Russian. I think they are favorable to the united Ukraine. I believe that the best way out for Ukraine at this stage is to have a united Ukraine, where you have the industrially productive east and the agriculturally productive west, combined in one entity, moving forward. I think thatâ€™s in the best interests of Russia, I think it is best interests of the US, so I do see a way out, absolutely, it makes all the sense in the world.

JW: They are hoping for a US bailout ad infinitum, for their perpetually failed state. I mean, we do know that the western half of Ukraine is an economically destitute region, we do know that, and Iâ€™m sure they are looking for the long-term US-government support, if not European support. Itâ€™s a long-term problem, I mean the division of Ukraine is a long-term problem for the EU and the US, and the EU is in no position right now, given the state of the eurozone, itâ€™s in no position to take on that responsibility, and frankly, neither is the US, and I think, if you follow the money â€“ I think thatâ€™s at the heart of this issue, and the solution in my viewpoint is to have a united Ukraine, as Russia has proposed.

JW: Well they are doing some of that right now â€“ I believe theyâ€™ve committed a billion, thereâ€™s been certain money already flowing to this new putsch government in Kiev, so I do believe they are going to do it again, I believe that theyâ€™re morally obligated to do so.

JW: Yes. Yes, I mean thatâ€™s a cocktail for political and social instability â€“ that is a dangerous cocktail. You know, I think if we could roll back the clock and go back to the initial proposals of Russia, I think those would have worked for the Ukrainian people. At this stage we do know, I mean, I was in the Asian economic crisis, I was deeply involved in that, as it was unfolding, and through it. And these IMF austerity plans are severe, right? Nobody gets a free lunch, and I can see whatâ€™s coming for Ukraine, itâ€™s not pleasant, there would be further political instability and social instability. Itâ€™s not an easy solution.

JW: Absolutely, thatâ€™s what I see coming in the future. Again, I donâ€™t think the US intended this. I donâ€™t think that when they originally went in, I think it was a political decision, I donâ€™t think theyâ€™ve considered all the ramifications of their actions, I donâ€™t think they understood the country of Ukraine, or the outcome, I donâ€™t think they understood that.

JW: Itâ€™s a long-term process, you know. We donâ€™t share a border with Russia, I mean itâ€™s easy - Europe, Germany in particular has long-term cultural ties with Russia. I donâ€™t think a lot of Americans know that even at the height of the Cold War, the tensest moments of the Cold War, Russia was supplying energy products to Germany. They are always a reliable supplier. We donâ€™t have this long term context, but I do believe that these types of contacts, not only are they financially beneficial for both countries, but they also are the breaks on the military activity, bellicose actions, confrontation â€“ so I think trade, globalization, plays a great role in world peace and stability.

JW: I think this: how do I say it? I believe it, that weâ€™ve still got a lot of old â€œCold Warriorsâ€� within the governments of both Russia and the US, Western Europe, and these are people whoâ€™ve built their careers, their core competencies are all built around, careers centered around, for example in America, centered around understanding the foe, the Soviet Union, and these people are just like you and I - they need to feed their families, and one of the key things that we know about the consulting business or being an employee, is that you identify the problem, or, more cynically, you create a problem, that you are the solution for. So, youâ€™ve got a lot of these undercurrents, I believe in, letâ€™s call it a deep state, in the US â€“ eventually, theyâ€™ll move on, theyâ€™ll retire, theyâ€™ll die off, whateverâ€¦Weâ€™ll get the same in Russia, weâ€™ll get the same in Western Europe, and we just move forward. I believe itâ€™s a longer term process. The fall of the Berlin Wall was a discreet event â€“ but the act of actually coming together as nations is a longer term process.

JW: Well, we donâ€™t know that, we donâ€™t know precisely what that bait is, Sophie. We donâ€™t see everything. Thereâ€™s been some type of arm twisting that has gotten this far to the table, this close to their red line. I donâ€™t quite understand what that is, but I do believe and I think that there is that red line, okay, that theyâ€™ve had drawn internally in the sand. America knows that theyâ€™ve got that red line; this is not a red line drawn by Russia, this is a red line drawn by the EU, by Germany in particular, that they wonâ€™t cross. And, as they get closer to this red line, they are going to up the rhetoric, itâ€™s going to get louder and louder until, you know, they can go no further.

JW: Level three sanctions, I think, are that red line. I donâ€™t think that the Europeans are willing to go across that red line, because youâ€™ve got too much at stake. My goodness, I think that, if you fear that Russiaâ€™s going to cut you off from gas, youâ€™ve got to go back in history and understand that Russia, even at the height of the Cold War, even at the very height, at most tense moments of the Cold War, was always a reliable supplier to Germany, so you can eliminate that for your fear, and if you are Germany and these ideas are floating around about re-diversifying your gas supplies, if youâ€™re doing it in a punitive way towards Russia, then youâ€™re basically shooting yourself in the foot, because youâ€™ve got to re-source that gas, youâ€™ve got to go, letâ€™s say, to Qataris, get them to ship LNG to Rotterdam, youâ€™ve got to re-gas, youâ€™ve got to store, youâ€™ve got to transport through pipes...I guarantee, the deliver price of that gas to Germany is going to be a heck of a lot higher than US$400 for a thousand cubic meters, that they get from Russia.

JW: I believe so, yes, absolutely, because it threatens the viability of the eurozone, Sophie. Anything that threats the German economy, threatens the ability of Germans to be lender of last resort, and the eurozone still has fundamental problems. There are problems coming ahead for the eurozone, and Germany needs to be able to step to play as a glue to keep it together.

JW: Absolutely. Not worried about, but aware of. Now, Sophie, in the Western mainstream media, we didnâ€™t receive that information; I thought that was profoundly important information, after Sergey Lavrovâ€™s visit in Beijing, the declarationâ€¦I mean, I had to find this on a Chinese media news site â€“ these highly positive statements, both for Russia, the Russian-Chinese relationship and the mutual relationship between the leaders of Russia and China. I think it's profoundly important information, I believe the US is isolating itself from the economic future of the world, the BRICS. Which BRIC relationship do we have a good, solid, ongoing relationship with right now? None! Brazil? No. Russia? No! India? No. China? No â€“ so I think weâ€™re backing ourselves into a dangerous corner; weâ€™re isolating ourselves from the future, the acknowledged economic future of the world. Thatâ€™s one reason that...have come out so strongly at this point.

SS: Alright, Jack, thank you very much for this great interview. Itâ€™s been great talking to you. We were talking to Jack Worthington, prominent US financial advisor â€“ talking about whatâ€™s in store for Ukraine and who would the sanctions benefit or not? This is it for this edition of SophieCo, we will see you next time.

Gre at guest and I like the easy style of the show. But you still know how to zing a 98 mph fast ball question. Did the guest overestimate Washington's influence in Ukraine? Great question. And your follow-ups are so quick.

This and Cross Talk are my favorite shows now.
