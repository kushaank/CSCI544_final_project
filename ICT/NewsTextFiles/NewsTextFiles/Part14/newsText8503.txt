Ray Bradbury’s home of more than 50 years, where he did much of his writing, is on the market in Cheviot Hills at $1.495 million.

The traditional home, built in 1937, features vaulted ceilings, a brick fireplace in the living room, wainscoting and crown molding. The 2,456 square feet of living space includes three bedrooms and three bathrooms.

Bradbury, who died two years ago at age 91, would write almost daily in the home’s basement. A two-car garage faces the street, and there are front and back lawns.

The writer’s published works included novels, plays, screenplays and short stories. Among his popular titles are “Fahrenheit 451,” “The Martian Chronicles” and “The Illustrated Man.” He was awarded a Pulitzer Prize in 2007.
