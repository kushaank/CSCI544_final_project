
BOSTON (AP) -- The smell of burning bread crumbs had forced a Miami-bound American Airlines flight to return to Boston.

An airlines spokeswoman says Flight 1532 took off from Boston's Logan International Airport at 6:36 a.m. Sunday, but passengers soon began smelling smoke.

The plane returned to Boston at 7:10 a.m., and the smell was found to be from bread crumbs burning in an oven.

The oven was cleaned, and the flight took off again at 8:20 a.m.

The plane was carrying 150 passengers and five crew members.

NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) -- The Charles W. Morgan, the last surviving ship from America's 19th -century whaling fleet, has departed Mystic Seaport to begin its 38th voyage.

The ship, which had not left Mystic Seaport since it arrived in 1941, was towed down the Mystic River on Saturday and to nearby New London. It was the first stop on what will be a nearly three-month journey to ports in southern New England.

The ship will be open to the public in New London with a dockside exhibit on May 24-25, May 31, and June 1.

The ship departs on the next leg of its voyage when it sets sail for Newport, R.I., on June 14. The ship will later visit Boston and Vineyard Haven and New Bedford in Massachusetts.
