BRATTLEBORO  Guilford resident Shirley Squires may stand only 5 feet, but she can report plenty of tall numbers.

Take her age: 83. And current count of children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren shes matriarch for: 55. And amount of money she has raised the past two decades for the AIDS Project of Southern Vermont: $250,000.

I like the sound of quarter of a million better, Squires said this weekend.

So, apparently, did the hundreds of Vermonters who helped her reach that milestone at this towns 27th annual Walk for Life.

Squires joined the annual spring march shortly after the 1993 death of her 41-year-old son, Rep. Ronald Squires, D-Guilford, the first Vermont legislator to announce his homosexuality  he did so to help pass an anti-discrimination law  and the first state public figure to lose his life to AIDS.

Soliciting 800 family members, friends and organizations statewide, Squires has gone from collecting $1,000 in her first walk to culling $12,000 on her 10th anniversary and $19,500 on her 20th.

Squires annually aims to raise a dollar more than she did the year before. During her 22nd walk Saturday, she not only raised a record $22,000  two-thirds of the entire events $30,000 take  but also reached her $250,000 lifetime total.

Instead, it benefits the AIDS Project, a Brattleboro-based nonprofit whose annual budget of a little more than $400,000 pays for community prevention efforts and individual support for 70 clients in Bennington and Windham counties.

Vermonts three AIDS service organizations are trying to balance steady caseloads  about 600 people statewide are living with the human immunodeficiency virus that causes the disease  as the federal government shifts its financial assistance from smaller towns to bigger cities.
