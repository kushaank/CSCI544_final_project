
SALINE — Every year, Main Street holds it National Conference in a different location. And every year, the Main Street convention-goers from the state of Wyoming come into the conference location a few days early and visit some Main Street communities nearby.

This year’s Main Street National Conference is in Detroit and the state of Wyoming has decided that one of the cities it wants to visit is Saline.

The contingent from Wyoming will be in Saline on Friday, May 16, from 8:30 a.m. – 1 p.m. They’ll spend time meeting with everyone from Saline Main Street, taking a tour of our downtown, shopping, and enjoying lunch in our downtown restaurants.

If you see a tour going by on Friday, or you run into some people from Wyoming in the stores and restaurants downtown, be sure to give them a great big welcome.
