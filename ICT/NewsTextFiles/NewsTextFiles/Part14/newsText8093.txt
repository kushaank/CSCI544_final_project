OCEAN SPRINGS, Mississippi -- Ocean Springs leaders should rebuild the collapsed section of their Front Beach sidewalk closer to the seawall and remove the decorative wall completely, Jackson County supervisors said today.

The supervisors agreed to ask the city to consider the move, which Supervisor Troy Ross said would help the county in maintaining the beach sand there.

Ross said the county is asking the city to move the section from where the sidewalk has collapsed toward Martin Avenue.

County leaders would like the sidewalk to be moved next to the existing seawall, and they would like the decorative seat wall removed in that area as well.

The decorative wall could remain in other areas, they said.

"I think in that area, (the seat wall) greatly enhances erosion," Ross said, noting that the city should "understand this is strong encouragement."

Additional breaks are possible, leaders have said.

Last week, the county trucked in loads of sand to shore up the beach.

Supervisor John McKay said the sidewalk design was faulty from the beginning, as it was poured atop sand with no foundation.

Originally, the sidewalk was also supposed to abut the seawall, McKay said, not meander away from the seawall 20 or more feet.

The $1.8 million sidewalk was funded through a Community Development Block Grant.
