
In a down day for the market, airline shares were flying high.

Ryanair has provided encouraging guidance on near-term load factors and yield growth, offset by the heavily cautious second half (winter) outlook and some delays to new business and family product roll-out. We retain our buy given the scope for pushing through further passenger and yield growth from improved customer service and upscaling of airport routes.

Investors are apparently betting that consumers have tired of the extreme no-frills approached that once worked so well for Ryanair, and that the gradual return of affluence will cause people to trade up in their air travel choices.

Overall the FTSE 100 finished down 11.26 points at 6844.55, but would have been in positive territory if not for AstraZeneca . The pharmaceuticals group dropped 536p or 11% to 4287.5p after rejecting Pfizer's "final" bid proposal. Astra's fall knocked more than 26 points off the leading index.

Following the FDA meeting, and likely commitment to develop Lifitegrast globally, we raise our peak sales estimate 70% to $1.2bn, increase the probability of approval to 90%, and move our launch year forward to 2016 from 2017.

Weekend news of a slowdown in the Chinese property market renewed concerns about growth in the country's economy, undermining parts of the commodities sector. BHP Billiton fell 11p to £19.42 while Rio Tinto lost 61.5p to £32.25. But Anglo American added 4p to 1565.5p and Antofagasta was 9.5p better at 800p.

Catering group Compass climbed 10.5p to £10.01 after it gave more details of its proposed £1bn cash return. Investors will receive 56p for each share they own, and the company also plans a 16 for 17 share consolidation to roughly maintain the market price for its shares.

We see the announcement as positive. However, in our view, investors will likely wait to see these savings being reflected in the company's bottom line, before fully rewarding the company (ie the shares) for it.
