
On Thursday, a mailer landed in District 16 allegedly paid for by the 501(c)4 organization “Keep Texas Working.” This mail piece made accusations that have been circulated by the Will Metalf campaign for the last several months. It seems they decided to use an outside group to conduct the attacks rather than have the campaign levy the accusations directly.

According to the Ted Seago campaign, what surprised many voters in District 16, besides the incredibly misleading attacks, was the fact that Keep Texas Working decided to publish Seago’s personal social security number to over ten thousand households in District 16.

This act with intent to harm Dr. Seago is in violation of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a and the Texas Penal Code 32.51 (Identity Theft Prevention Act).
