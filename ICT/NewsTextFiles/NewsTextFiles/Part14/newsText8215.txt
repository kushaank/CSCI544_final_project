
WASHINGTON (AP) Vice President Joe Biden is planning to headline a fundraiser for Democrats at the home of billionaire Tom Steyer.

That's according to a Democratic official who demanded anonymity because the event hasn't been officially announced.

Biden will travel to San Francisco for the May 28 event benefiting the Democratic National Committee. The committee is working its way out of millions in debt it racked up helping President Barack Obama get re-elected.

Steyer was a major donor to Obama's campaign and has increased his political activity in recent months. He's a prominent environmentalist and opponent of the Keystone XL pipeline.

Steyer hosted another Democratic fundraiser last year that Obama attended. He's vowed to spend $100 million on the 2014 midterm elections.

Politico first reported the news of the Biden fundraiser.
