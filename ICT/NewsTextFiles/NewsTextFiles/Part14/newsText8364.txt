City leaders hope that at the meeting, the city will make a decision on whether a popular grocery store will stay or go.

The city of Leawood Kansas could decide Monday night if the popular Hy-Vee grocery store located at 122nd and State Line Road will stay open.

No matter what's decided, officials with the Hy-Vee grocery chain have already announced the store is closing on June 1.

On Monday night, Leawood City Council members could decide if the grocery store will close temporarily for renovations, or if it will close for good.

For weeks, Hy-Vee has had disagreements with city officials on how store improvements should be paid for.

Hy-Vee sought the creation of a community improvement district and asked the city for $4 million to help it pay for both external and internal improvements.

The half-cent sales tax increase would be paid for by shoppers at the store. That means shoppers would pay 50 cents more than they do now on a $100 grocery bill.

CID money doesn't come from the city budget.

Still, Leawood City Council members have been reluctant to pass the proposal because CID is supposed to be used for a business's external improvements only.

Hy-Vee could bring a whole new proposal to council Monday night.

It has already expressed interest in moving altogether to a brand new store at 135th and Roe.

Leawood's City Council will hear from Hy-Vee representatives at 5:30 p.m. Public comments will be heard after the meeting at 7:30 p.m.
