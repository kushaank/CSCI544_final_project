The book, released in March, was published by Arcadia Publishing.

FLORENCE – History is more than names and dates, according to Eric Jackson.

Those are the people highlighted in the book “Cincinnati’s Underground Railroad” which the Florence resident put together with Richard Cooper, manager of content development and interpretation at the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center.

Published by Arcadia Publishing, the book is a collection of photographs that tells the stories of the men and women involved in Cincinnati’s Underground Railroad.

Jackson said he came up with the idea for the book when Cooper was looking for a project to do to complete NKU’s master’s in public history program. They conducted a majority of the research old-school style, Jackson said. Researching was his favorite part of the process.

Jackson, 49, resides in Florence with his wife B.J. They have two grown children. Jackson has been with Northern for 20 years. He earned his undergrad at Ball State and his master’s and doctorate at the University of Cincinnati.

Jackson said he is proud of the final product and hopes others will learn something from the book. He said the subject is fascinating and inspirational.

He’ll sign copies of “Cincinnati’s Underground Railroad,” at 6 p.m. May 20 at the Cold Spring Branch of the Campbell County Public Library. For more information, visit cc-pl.org.

Jackson will attend the Underground Railroad in Boone County Driving Tour 10 a.m May 30. For ticket information, visit bcpl.org.

Another book signing will be hosted 7 p.m. June 9, at the Boone County Public Library in Burlington.
