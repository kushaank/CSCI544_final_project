
The Community Health Center Association of Connecticut, Inc. (CHCACT), in partnership with the National Council on Aging (NCOA) and with support from the Walmart Foundation, has joined a nationwide effort to fight hunger in older adults by dramatically increasing participation of eligible seniors in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly Food Stamps).

Senior hunger, often called America's "hidden hunger," is on the rise. Nearly 5 million adults over age 60 do not have consistent access to healthy food. SNAP is our nations' most powerful and effective anti-hunger program, but it is highly underutilized by older adults.

In Connecticut, about 50,300 seniors all across the state currently receive SNAP benefits, representing 12.5 percent of those on SNAP. SNAP households with people over the age of 60 receive an average monthly benefit of $148.98, which they can spend in grocery stores, convenience stores and even some farmers' markets. But the need is still great - estimates are that only 34 percent of the seniors eligible for SNAP in Connecticut are actually enrolled.

CHCACT is one of 40 community organizations around the country that is stepping up its efforts to assist seniors in applying for SNAP. The initiative aims to help at least 35,000 seniors nationwide enroll in SNAP this year.

"We're proud to be part of a pilot effort that has the potential to help tens of thousands of low income older adults improve their health and financial security," said Lori-Anne Russo, CHCACT's director of clinical programs. "CHCACT and its affiliated community health centers have been working to improve overall health in Connecticut, including through SNAP outreach. We're excited about this opportunity to enhance our outreach efforts to seniors, which are a hard-to-reach population in our state."
