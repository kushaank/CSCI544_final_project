
The Patriots have agreed to terms with undrafted rookie free agent wide receiver Derrick Johnson , according to league sources.

Johnson, who attended the University of Maine, was a standout for the Black Bears program. He was tied for the team lead in 2013 with 60 catches, including two receiving scores.

He brings an element of speed to the field, as he reportedly was the fastest player in the Maine program with a 40 time clocked in the 4.3 range.

The Patriots had four open roster spots prior to the Johnson addition, with 11 wide receivers signed to deals. The team drafted Jeremy Gallon out of Michigan in the seventh round, adding to a receiver corps led by Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola .
