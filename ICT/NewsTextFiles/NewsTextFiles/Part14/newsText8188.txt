
Cheyenne, WY (AP) - Federal land managers have begun evaluating a proposal to expand an east-central Wyoming oil and gas field with up to 5,000 new wells, asking for public comment on issues surrounding the project.

The Bureau of Land Management published a formal notice in the Federal Register Friday that energy companies want to drill the wells over a 10-year period on more than 2,300 square miles in Converse County.

BLM officials first disclosed the proposal in January.

Meetings to get public comment on the issues will be held in Casper, Douglas and Glenrock. Dates haven't been set.

The BLM will also take written comments.

About 83 percent of the land identified for the project is privately owned. The federal government owns the mineral rights under about 65 percent of the land.
