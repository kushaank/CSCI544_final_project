
Longmont residents soon may be able to ride a Regional Transportation District bus for free from July to December under a plan to keep  rolling the bus routes with chronically low ridership numbers.

Boulder County will buy the fares on  all four of Longmont's local fixed bus routes — 323, 324, 326 and 327 — at a cost of $286,000. The county also will pick up the expenses for running the complementary Access-a-Ride service, which is offered to elderly and disabled residents.

In return, RTD will keep the four routes running  during a six-month promotion, which  the agency hopes eventually will boost  sagging ridership numbers in the city.

"We've always had an inherent problem in keeping our ridership up  even though we pay the same RTD sales tax as other residents in the district," said    Judy Lubow, who represents Longmont on the RTD board of directors. Lubow said she will support the plan when it is presented      Tuesday night at an RTD meeting.

Boulder County is buying up the   fares along with  the  city of Longmont to   save the routes.  Ridership is about 600 boardings a day, down from previous highs of 800 per day, said RTD.

"The objective of this action is to build ridership and prevent future service reductions by the RTD," said    Bruce Abel, RTD's assistant general manager.

The buy-ups may be extended for two years, depending on the success of the program, said Abel.

Lubow said ridership in Longmont started diving several years ago when  fares in Longmont were made the same as those in  Denver.

"We're not in the middle of Denver, where you can have one token and you can travel quite a distance," Lubow said. "We pay the same price even though we only go for a few minutes. We've just never recovered from that."

Despite the high fares, residents want to keep their bus service.

"It's got the support of local stakeholders," Lubow said, "and local citizens really want it."
