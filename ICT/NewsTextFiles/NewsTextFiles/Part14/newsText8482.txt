
Although Hollywood is thousands of miles away, some of its youngest stars made their way to Alaska this week.

Kidz Bop — a musical group that puts a friendly spin on some of today’s hottest tunes — traveled to Anchorage to film a commercial and music video. Dozens of Alaskan kids had the chance to participate.

The youth group has released 25 albums since 2001 and has 18 top 10 debuts. Sally Bunnell, the group’s director, said it’s important to Kidz Bop to travel to communities like Anchorage.

“This is where our real fans are,” Bunnell said.

Producer Fuliane Petikyan said the state’s film tax credit program also played a role in bringing Kidz Bop to the Last Frontier.
