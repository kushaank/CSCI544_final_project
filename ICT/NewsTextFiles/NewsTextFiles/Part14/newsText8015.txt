
UCPN (Maoist) leader Dr Baburam Bhattarai on Sunday said that the crusade of political change has ended, and it is high time now to initiate campaigns for economic, social and cultural transformations.With corruption inside the party not yet cleared and the Judicial Council coming up with the recommendation of very controversial judges to fill the vacant positions in the Supreme Court, it is very hard to believe Bhattarai that the crusade for political change has ended. If the killing of more than 16,000 Nepalis was aimed at breeding corruption, it is time to accept that the insurgency was a terrible waste of time and human resources.

The crusade for the eradication of corrupt politics guided by the careerist objective of fattening the leaders must be intensified with full determination now, and the political crusade should be centered on the purification of politics of corruption and crimes. The crusade for real political change should urgently begin now.

formation of the government.
