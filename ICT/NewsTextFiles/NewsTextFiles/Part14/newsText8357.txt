
Authorities say drugs are to blame in a string of recent shootings that have startled residents in sections of Fort Myers and Lehigh Acres.

Nine shootings in the past three weeks have left neighbors frightened. Some are too scared to even talk about it.

Most recently, 17-year-old Malique Brown was fatally shot Saturday along the 3100 block of Franklin Street in the Dunbar community of Fort Myers.

Neighbor to the violence, James Bing discussed a reluctance to come forward.

"We don't feel like we're going to be protected and that of course would give anybody pause," Bing said.

Authorities point to the illegal drug trade as a cause for the violence, and say they are working together to fight the crime.

"These are people with little to no regard for human life," said Lee County Sheriff Mike Scott.

"These are individuals where the drug trade is at the root of everything they are doing," Scott said.

Neighbors are concerned with shootings still unsolved. "Evidently the people who are holding us hostage feel that they can get away with it," said Bing.

Scott stressed the shootings have been targeted, and not random. Fort Myers Police over the weekend increased patrols in Dunbar.

Anyone with information on Brown's murder is asked to call Detective Emily Destefanis at 239-321-7700, Crime Stoppers at 1-800-780-TIPS or text message C-R-I-M-E-S (274637) Keyword FMPD.

FMPD is offering a reward of up to $25,000 to anyone who provides information that leads to the arrest and conviction of a person or persons responsible for any homicide in the City of Fort Myers. Tipsters can remain anonymous.
