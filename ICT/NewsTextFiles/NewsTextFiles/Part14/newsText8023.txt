
The National Highway Safety Administration is holding its Click it or Ticket Border to Border seat belt Enforcement Blitz. Police from Delaware are teaming up with law enforcement from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland for the effort that runs from 6 to 10 pm Monday evening.

NHSA regional administrator Elizabeth Baker says the blitz is being done later in the day because that when the danger associated with not buckling up increases.

The goal is to send a zero-tolerance message to motorists: anyone caught riding in a vehicle without using a seat belt will result in the driver being ticketed. Part of a two week enforcement push by state and local police in the First State, the stepped-up enforcement will run until June 1.

Colonel Richard Arroyo of the Delaware River and Bay Authority says the initial multi-state approach aims to get people’s attention – especially young adults, pick-up truck drivers and men – who make up the majority of unrestrained deaths.

Chris Weersing – who was seriously injured while not properly restrained in a 2005 accident – agrees with Col. Arroyo’s assesment. His passenger remained relatively unharmed during the same accident thanks to the use of a seat belt, and now Weersing tours the area talking to young people about the benefits of buckling up.

The beefed up enforcement effort comes after fatalities for unrestrained passengers rose for the first time in five years. In 2012, just over 10,300 unbuckled passengers died in crashes. In 2013, 47% of crash fatalities weren’t properly restrained.
