
'Exceptional teamwork and the ability to advance collaboration is a common thread among this year’s GISLA finalists,' said W. Hord Tipton.

(ISC)²® (“ISC-squared”), the largest not-for-profit membership body of certified information and software security professionals with over 100,000 members worldwide, today announced the finalists for its 11th annual U.S. Government Information Security Leadership Awards (GISLA®) program.

Sponsored by the (ISC)2 U.S. Government Advisory Board for Cyber Security (GABCS), the GISLA program was established in 2004 to recognize federal information security leaders (individuals or teams) whose commitment to excellence is advancing the nation’s cybersecurity program in five areas: workforce, technology, process/policy, community awareness, and the contractor community.

Each year, a judging committee of senior information security experts from the (ISC)² GABCS and industry reviews the nominees and recommends finalists based upon selection criteria and eligibility requirements. (ISC)² officials and sponsors will announce and honor the 2014 GISLA recipients on June 3, 2014, at the Crystal Gateway Marriott in Arlington, Va.
