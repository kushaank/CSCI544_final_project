
Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department John David Matta, 53, grinned for the camera after his arrest Sunday.

A 53-year-old Northern California man grinned in his mugshot after he was collared and locked up for slaying his elderly mother in their shared Antelope home Sunday afternoon.

John David Matta rang up 911 and told a dispatcher he’d “had an altercation with his mother” before the line went dead, the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department said in a news release. Upon arrival at the home in the northern suburb of Sacramento, cops found Janet M. Matta, 75, dead. They arrested John Matta, her son and the only other person who lived in the home.

The cause of death has not been confirmed, according to the Sacramento Bee. Police have not disclosed the circumstances surrounding the fatal fight.

Matta writes that he is a former truck driver from New York City on his Facebook page. On a Meetup.com page for the Sacramento Animal Rights group, Matta describes himself as “an empathetic protector of reincarnated human souls in animal form.

“I have a mission to change tactics used by an extermination company to rid skunks,” he wrote on his profile.

It’s unclear if Matta suffered from any mental illness.

He’s due in court Tuesday afternoon.
