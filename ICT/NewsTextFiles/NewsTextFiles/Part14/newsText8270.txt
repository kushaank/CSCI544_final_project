
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — This year’s June 16-17 Farm Management Tour, organized by the Purdue University Department of Agricultural Economics, will showcase five successful Indiana farms in Spencer and Dubois counties.

The tour, in its 82nd year, encourages a high level of management knowledge and skill among Indiana farmers. It is open to anyone interested in farm management and family-farm businesses.

A variety of farm-related topics will be highlighted in interviews with the host farmers and mini-tours at three of the southern Indiana farms.

“The farmers will share their keys to successful farm management and explain how the management of their operations is changing in response to the vibrant agricultural economy and the changing circumstances of their families,” said Alan Miller, Purdue Extension farm business specialist and coordinator of the tour.
