If this keeps up,  Johnny Weir and Victor Voronov ‘s latest reunion won’t last much longer.

Two days after the troubled couple were involved in a scratch-filled fight at their New Jersey home, Voronov, 30, spoke with “ Inside Edition ” about the heated incident.

“I was terrified. He was red,” the attorney told the news magazine program in the first of a two-part interview.

Voronov also detailed the attack, including the injuries he sustained: a bite mark on his shoulder, scratches on his leg and a small cut on his hand.

“All of the attacks came from his fingernails. He has long fingernails, big fingernails too. And they all came from scratching,” he said.

According to earlier reports , the couple got into it after the former Olympic figure skater, 29, found texts “badmouthing” him on his husband’s phone.

Voronov is said to have reported the altercation to police on Sunday, although he did not seek an emergency restraining order.

In a previous interview with “Inside Edition,” Voronov was adamant that he would not be getting back together with his husband, but he reconsidered when he received a phone call from a vulnerable Weir soon after.
