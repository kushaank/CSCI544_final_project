Felecia Williams' family is asking whoever killed her, or knows who did, to come forward.

Felecia Demerson, Felecia Williams' mother, speaks with reporters on the hunt for her daughter's killer.

The Temple Terrace Police chief said he will only talk with the media once they make an arrest.

"Come forward, turn yourself in because I need closure," says Felecia Demerson in her plea to whoever killed her young daughter.

She said there are many missing pieces to this horrific puzzle.

"It's been agonizing just wondering what happened -- why it happened," she says.

"I would like to know what she is hiding. Because it's a lot of things on her negligence that's puzzling me."

What's also puzzling to this mother she's trusted Eboni countless times before to care for her daughter.

"She took her to lunch, took her to church. She did good things with her.  That's basically why I couldn't see at first her harming Felecia."

The Temple Terrace Police Department promised Felecia they will not rest until they find out who did this to her little girl, someone Demerson said never met a stranger and always had a smile on her face.
