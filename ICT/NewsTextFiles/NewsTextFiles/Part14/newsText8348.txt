STATEN ISLAND, N.Y -- Councilwoman Debi Rose backs the City Council's Black, Latino & Asian Caucus (BLAC) in its protest of gun violence on the steps of City Hall on Monday in Manhattan that cites the cold-blooded murder of deliveryman Richard Salvia on Staten Island.

The Caucus -- which also cited major instances of gun violence in all of the other boroughs-- wants 1,000 more officers to patrol city neighborhoods and greater involvement by community groups to stop violent crime.

"Council Member Rose also strongly supports the efforts of the council to address the underlying causes of this violence in the community through, amongst other ways, the Cure Violence programs supported by the Anti-Violence Task Force of the City Council," said Edwina Martin, a spokeswoman for Ms. Rose.

The Staten Island Cure Violence anti-gun program was launched last May by Ms. Rose (D-North Shore) on the steps of Curtis High School in partnership with the Rev. Dr. Demetrius Carolina and the Central Family Life Center of his First Central Baptist Church in Stapleton.

Ms. Rose missed the Caucus press conference in Manhattan because she was meeting with Rev. Carolina for a status update on the Staten Island Cure Violence program.
