The Lyndon Township planning commission will use its meeting Monday night to question representatives of McCoig Materials Inc. about their plans to develop a sand mine north of Chelsea.

The meeting will be held at 6 p.m. in the auditorium in the Washington Street Education Center in Chelsea. This will be the third time that the commission has held public meetings related to the proposed mine, but it is the first chance for commissioners to directly question the mining company.

Consulting firm ForEnergy has been representing McCoig throughout the process of obtaining a special use permit for the land from the township’s planning commission. Local residents have given more than five hours of testimony about the mine, all of it negative and have submitted further information through letters and emails to the commission.

The meeting Monday night comes one week after a public written correspondence between the planning commission and ForEnergy concluded with the consulting firm responding to a large number of questions. Those responses are expected to be available for public viewing in the near future on the Lyndon Township website.
