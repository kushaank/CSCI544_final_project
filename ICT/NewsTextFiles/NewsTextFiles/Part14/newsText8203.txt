
Typically a 71-year-old man is not a teenage girl's first choice for prom. For 18-year-old Talia Maselli, however, it was. Her dream date? Vice president Joe Biden.

Last fall Maselli penned Biden a letter that read, "I am inviting you so far in advance because I'm sure many 17-year-old girls send you prom invitations, and I had to beat them to it," Maselli tells  The Courant . "I could only tolerate a high school dance if I was to be escorted by the most delightful man in America."

"Joe Biden makes me laugh," Maselli further tells The Courant. "He just cracks me up."

Seven months later and the morning before prom, Maselli received a corsage with a personalized note from the VP.

According to The Courant, Biden wrote, "I am flattered, but my schedule will not permit me to be in Connecticut on Friday evening. But I hope you will accept this corsage and enjoy your prom as much as I did mine."

"A spokeswoman at Biden's press office said Friday that the vice president read Maselli's invitation and was touched by it. He personally picked the corsage of white roses, baby's breath and red, white and blue ribbons," further reports The Courant. "He wanted her to feel special at her prom, even though he wasn't able to come," the spokeswoman said.

Maselli did not go to her prom at Newington High School, however, she is scheduled to meet Biden in July at the White House after being personally invited with her family.
