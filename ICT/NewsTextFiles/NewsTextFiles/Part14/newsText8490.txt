
CHIPPEWA FALLS, Wis. (WEAU) -- "The building we're looking at here is the one with white windows on the 2nd floor," said Nathan Bell, a Partner with TNN Properties.

If you look closely at an old picture of downtown Chippewa Falls, you will see changes that have happened between then and now to the former Konsella's Drug Store at Bridge Street and Grand Avenue.

"So this is what the building used to look like back in the day before they filled in with cinder block," Bell said.

The building, which sat vacant after Konsella's moved out, is now getting a facelift.

"This here is going to be the front space," Bell pointed out.

And soon will become home to a New TC Teks computer shop and anybody that wants to lose the 2nd space.

Nathan Bell's idea is to give the building a historic feel and return it to the way it used to be.

"So it's a ton of space exposed to the Grand Avenue side, a busy street here in Chippewa Falls," he added.

Teri Ouimette with Chippewa Falls Main Street is happy to see past and present brought together in a building plan.

"It's a great thing like this for the city, we're fortunate to have people like this in the community," she said.

And Joyce Pugh, whose Country Treasures and Hallmark neighbor the new building, appreciates the thought that has gone into the plans.

"We're excited having owners that are interested in investing in their buildings to bring them back to the way they used to be," she said.

Bell says construction will continue but if all goes according to plan, the TC Teks store in the renovated building should open on July 1st.
