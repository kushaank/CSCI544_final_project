
Korean-Americans across the U.S. held rallies Sunday to protest against the Park Geun-hye administration for its handling of the Sewol ferry tragedy.

On Sunday afternoon, about 120 Korean-Americans gathered to commemorate the victims of the Sewol ferry disaster and denounce the government for its “censorship of the media and anti-democratic actions” at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.

Prior to the rally, the protesters handed out photocopies of the advertisement taken out in the New York Times last Sunday by the Korean-American community in Los Angeles to express their anger at the South Korean government.

The rally organizers refused to state their names or the associations they are affiliated with, and said they were participating voluntarily.

About 20 meters away, some 20 Koreans demanded the rally be stopped, saying that the Sewol tragedy should not be used for political purposes. They asked whether the rally was truly intended for the victims and their families, and said the action was dividing the Korean community in the U.S. and spreading hatred instead.

At the same time in New York, 150 people gathered, shouting “Save the children” in front of the New York Times building. The protesters were dressed in black with yellow ribbons pinned to their clothing.

According to the New York rally organizer, protests were held in 39 states on Sunday, including in Atlanta, Georgia, and Irvine, California.
