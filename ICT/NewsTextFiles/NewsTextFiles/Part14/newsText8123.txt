The storm chasers, who call themselves Basehunters , captured the video of the thunderstorm in northeast Wyoming on Sunday, May 18th.

Ideally supercells form when winds are veering clockwise with height.  The winds produce storm-scale rotation, meaning the entire cloud rotates.

This can cause the cloud to have a corkscrew appearance.

Weather Adventures also posted a photo of the supercell on their  Facebook page .

Here are some more photos of the storm shared on Twitter.
