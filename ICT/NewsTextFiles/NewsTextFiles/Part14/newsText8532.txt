That’s the whole point behind On The Table, a 12,000-person meal spread out among thousands of homes and businesses.

Even farther south that night, the Rebuild Foundation invited artists to mingle with local neighborhood residents to “demystify” the foundation’s goals. The foundation is perhaps best known for being affiliated with artist Theaster Gates’ multipronged efforts to improve the greater Grand Crossing area.

One event held at WBEZ’s South Side bureau engaged residents in their wish to change the narrative of Chicago, so that people know the city for something more than the violence of Al Capone on up to the gang violence of today. Another, held at Wood Street Urban Farm in Englewood and hosted by Growing Home, Potluck Chicago and Grow Greater Chicago, led residents in a discussion of how to create a healthy community with greater access to a wider range of fresh foods.

The best of these ideas will make it to Chicago Ideas Week, coming in October, when like-minded folks get together to figure out how these ideas can be enacted for the greater good.
