
Incumbent Whitney Manwaring will face off against challenger Ralph West on Tuesday. Manwaring has been a commissioner for over three years and West is new to the political scene. They are both Republicans.

Some voters like Kirt McKinlay, who once sat on the board of directors for Bingham Memorial Hospital, are questioning West's relationship with hospital board member Wayne Brower.

"I think whoever represents that situation needs to not have ties or influence that could bias them," said McKinlay.

Manwaring didn't have a comment on West's relationship with the hospital, but did say his experience is what makes him different than his opponent.

Manwaring said those contracts involved the county hauling municipal waste and companies who were paid to pick up tires.

Meanwhile, West said his management skills make him different than Manwaring.

Manwaring said he wants to work on creating better roads for the county. West said he wants to make sure he is available for people in the county office.

Polls are open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday.
