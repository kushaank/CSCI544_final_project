
RADNOR — It’s been a busy four years for Havertown native Tara Whelan.

She would get up and go to school, then work in a before-and-after-care program at Monoa Elementary School, then come home and study for the better part of the night. With two senior capstones, the last semester has been the toughest.

But to her, it was all worth it.

Majoring in history, American studies and political science, Whelan graduated from Cabrini on Sunday morning, becoming the first in a family of eight children to graduate from college. She graduated summa cum laude and won the departmental award for history.

Whelan admitted, however, to being a bit nervous over the whole ceremony. She was one of 336 undergraduates that were in the same boat.

But just like the rest of them, with the tassels on their caps now resting on the left side, Whelan stood on stage with a smile on her face as her name was called.

What follows next for her isn’t clear, but she isn’t alone.

It was a color palette that seemed like a good idea when she was 13, but, along with an Earth Wind and Fire poster on the wall, grew dated.

Nutter told the story of how she worked in retail for a few months following her graduation, praying for a job, for someone to see her potential.

But she eventually caught a break interning and getting a job through her mentor, leaving her parents’ house for ... her grandmother’s house in North Philly, as she recalled with a slight chuckle.

But Nutter hoped it reassured the new graduates.

“I ask them to look beyond the basement nightmare,” Nutter said, recalling conversation with students leading up commencement. “At that point, almost everyone started to talk about the social network and support system that they’ve built at Cabrini and how they’re afraid of not having those relationships that they deemed critical.

At the beginning of her address, she asked the students to thank their loved ones, which they did without hesitation.

Along with the undergraduate class, nearly 635 graduate students earned their master’s degrees on Sunday.

While Nutter focused on reassurance and the keys to success, valedictorian Jennifer Persia acknowledged that this was a day of celebration in her address to the undergraduate class.
