CHAVIES, Ky. (WYMT) - Kentucky's senior senator stumped for votes in Eastern Kentucky Monday, one day before Republicans decide whether to make him their nominee for the general election.

Sen. Mitch McConnell spoke to several dozen supporters at Wendell Ford Airport in Perry County.

McConnell holds a 20-point lead over Louisville businessman and Tea Party favorite Matt Bevin in the GOP Primary, according to a Bluegrass Poll published Friday.

McConnell is confident he will win his party's nomination and earn support in November from people who back Bevin.

"The supporters of my primary opponent don't want Barack Obama's candidate to be elected," McConnell said, referencing Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, the likely Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate. "They don't want a vote for (Senate Majority Leader) Harry Reid. We all agree on that and we'll all get together for the fall election."

The same poll showing McConnell with a comfortable lead over Bevin indicates Grimes holds a one-point lead over McConnell, which is within the poll's margin of error.

"Kentuckians are ready for someone who has a fresh vision, a very strong voice and a plan as to how to put hardworking Kentuckians back to work," Grimes said Monday. "Someone, who in contrast to Sen. McConnell, actually believes it is the number one job of a United States senator to help put hardworking Kentuckians back to work."

Bevin contends McConnell has not done enough for Kentucky during his nearly 30 years in Washington.

In addition to his appearance in Perry County, McConnell also made six other stops in Kentucky Monday, the same day Grimes wrapped up a 10-day, 50-county bus tour.

Bevin cancelled his scheduled appearance in Somerset, the only one in the WYMT coverage area Monday.
