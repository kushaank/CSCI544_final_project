
The guitar purchased by Beatle George Harrison on his September 1963 trip to Southern Illinois sold for $657,000 at a weekend auction.

The rare 1962 Rickenbacker 425 sold after “fast and furious bidding from in the room and on the phone,” according to Julien’s Auction, which held the auction at the Hard Rock Café New York in Times Square.

Harrison purchased the Rickenbacker while on a two-week visit to Benton, where his sister Louise then lived.

Harrison bought the guitar at Fenton’s Music in Mount Vernon. He had the store’s owner refinish the guitar from a Fireglo finish to black so it would match a similar Rickenbacker used by band mate John Lennon.

Harrison played the guitar when The Beatles recorded “I Want to Hold Your Hand” in Abbey Road Studios and in the group’s first appearances on the television shows “Ready Steady Go!” and “Thank Your Lucky Stars” shortly after Harrison returned from the United States.

Lennon also played the guitar when backstage at a performance in Glasgow, Scotland on Oct. 5, 1963. A photograph published in an August 1964 issue of “Beat Monthly” magazine shows Lennon with the guitar.
