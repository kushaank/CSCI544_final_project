
Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has spent the past two days quietly meeting with activists in the Hawkeye State.

Bernie Sanders didn't just play a one night stand when he spoke to Democrats in Clinton County, Iowa on Saturday night.

But, by making the rounds and meeting Democratic activists, it's a strong indication that Sanders is taking an potential presidential campaign seriously and laying the groundwork necessary to mount a credible bid.Â Iowa Democrats have long expected presidential candidates to personally woo them and traditionally, potential candidates have paid repeated visits far earlier in the election cycle. The path to the Oval Office for a Democratic Socialist from Vermont will be difficult regardless, but it's clear so far that Sanders is putting in the necessary effort to maximize his chances.
