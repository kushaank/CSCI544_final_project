
Meanwhile, we have readers commenting on other developments around the Ukraine situation.

â€œJust saw that Ukraine cut off the water supply for Crimea thru the canal that flows from south Ukraine to Crimea. No water for crops, personal use. This is all orchestrated by US who wants to sell off Ukrainian assets, not help its people. IMF loan is bondage. Berlin is in uproar about neo-Nazi's paid by US.

Why doesn't Russia cut off the gas to Ukraine? Does that affect gas to rest of Europe? Crimea willing to pay for water, which is more than Ukraine can do for gas.
