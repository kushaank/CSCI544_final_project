
A Canadian company has asked the Michigan DNR to sell it more than 10,000 acres of state forestland in Mackinac County. Graymont, Incorporated wants to develop a limestone mine on the land in northern Mackinac County near Rexton.

The company first approached the DNR about a sale two years ago and explored the area for limestone in 2012 and 2013. The DNR is processing and reviewing Graymont’s application.

DNR staff will make a recommendation to DNR Director Keith Creagh, who has the authority to make the final decision. Creagh will make his decision at an unspecified future Natural Resources Commission meeting.
