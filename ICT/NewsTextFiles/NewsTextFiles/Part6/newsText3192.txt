
CHICAGO  Chinese hackers allegedly have stolen sensitive economic data from U.S. metal companies, including U.S. Steel Corp. and Alcoa Inc.

The U.S. Justice Department has charged five "Chinese military hackers" with cyber spying for allegedly breaking into the computers of companies with business in China or involved in trade petitions against Chinese competitors.

Victims of the alleged hacking include U.S. Steel, Alcoa, Allegheny Technologies Inc. (ATI), Westinghouse Electric Corp. and the United Steelworkers union, all based in Pittsburgh, the Justice Department said in a release May 19. Also among the alleged victims was Bonn, Germany-based solar energy company SolarWorld AG.

The hacking was part of an effort beginning in 2006, led by a Peoples Liberation Army signals-intelligence group known as "Unit 61398," to create a secret database of corporate intelligence on the iron and steel industries for a state-owned company in China, according to a May 1 indictment recently unsealed. The company was not named in the indictment.
