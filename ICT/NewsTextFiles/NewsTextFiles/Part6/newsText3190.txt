
â€‹Tensions over Chinaâ€™s offshore territorial dispute with Vietnam have given rise to the worst crisis between the two countries in decades.

Over 20 people were killed in an industrial park during recent clashes that saw Vietnamese mobs chase down and beat Chinese   workers. This episode of violence also saw Taiwanese and other   foreign workers targeted because they were mistaken for Chinese   nationals.

Cases of mass looting and arson have also erupted in areas of   southern and central Vietnam targeting Chinese nationals and   business interests, and reports indicate that anti-China unrest has   swept through 22 of Vietnamâ€™s 63 provinces.

Chinaâ€™s recent decision to setup a $1 billion deep-water oil   drilling rig in a disputed area of the South China Sea that   Vietnam also lays claim to triggered the latest waves of   violence.

Beijing has maintained an unwavering stance on maritime disputes,   and regards the Paracel Islands near the drilling site (known as   the Xisha Islands in China) as its sovereign territory. The   islands have no permanent human residents except for Chinese   military personnel and fishermen, and are valued for productive   fishing grounds and potential oil and gas reserves that China   would like to develop without depending on exploration agreements   with Western oil companies.

The controversial oil rig is located some 17 miles south of the   southwestern-most land feature in the Paracels, and within the   200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) that China   demarcates based on its claim to the islands, which are also   claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan. The rig itself is 120 miles off   Vietnamâ€™s Ly Son Island and thus on Vietnamâ€™s continental shelf   and well within Hanoiâ€™s EEZ.

Although China recognizes the territory as its own and may have   some legal historical justification for its position, Beijing was   fully aware that drilling in the area would be perceived as a   provocation. China has confirmed it has no plans to abandon the   drilling, and has called on the US to take on a neutral stance on   territorial disputes between Beijing and its neighbors.

Vietnamâ€™s leadership empathized with the protests but denounced   the violent actions taken by some demonstrators. Vietnam's Prime   Minister Nguyen Tan Dung is very cognizant of the destabilizing   effects that protracted protests can have on the economy, as he   urged measures to protect foreign investors, who are expected to   receive payouts for any damages incurred.

Vietnam has maintained bilateral relations throughout the years   with China and has consistently kept communication channels open.   Hanoi has held successive rounds of high-level negotiations over   disputed territories with Beijing, and would certainly prefer to   solve any issues and address tensions through bilateral dialogue,   as China has consistently called for.

Vietnam and China have yet to reach an agreement on their   territorial claims over the South China Sea, but the two   countries have productively struck deals over land border   disputes and maritime rights in the Gulf of Tonkin in the past.   Some kind of compromise is clearly within the realm of   possibility if cooler heads prevail and both sides remain   committed to negotiations.

Hanoi and Beijing both accuse each other of ramming each otherâ€™s   vessels and firing water cannons at the site of the Chinese oil   rig. Hanoi claims to have exercised restraint, while Beijingâ€™s   unilateral moves to drill in such sensitive waters could   conceivably put it in breach of a 2011 bilateral maritime pact it   signed with Vietnam to manage territorial disputes in a peaceful   way, among other international agreements.

When compared to the stance on territorial disputes taken by the   Philippines, which is less willing to hold dialogue with China   and instead unilaterally filed an arbitration case at the UN   against Beijing in March, Vietnam has exercised far more   restraint and willingness to solve the issues in a   non-antagonistic way.

The article addresses concerns over the infringement of national   sovereignty, and how Vietnam has not undertaken any action that   could trigger such a reaction from China. â€œChina's action is   considered provocative because it has sent 80 ships, including   seven warships, to accompany the oil rig. The action smacks of a   bully doing something wrong just because it can,â€� the   editorial argues.

Chinaâ€™s latest moves in the South China Sea have prompted a   debate in think-tank and foreign policy circles, who are at pains   to decipher the underlying message behind Beijingâ€™s unfolding   tussle with Hanoi. While many would prefer to think that China is   behaving in an irrational and non-strategic way, others would   argue that it is attempting to send a message.

Beijingâ€™s actions should be interpreted as a calculated response   to Washingtonâ€™s policy shift to Asia, which has been given   renewed priority following US President Barack Obamaâ€™s recent   four-nation tour of the region. During his trip, Obama   offered specific security guarantees to Japanese Prime Minister   Shinzo Abe that Washington would support Tokyoâ€™s territorial   claims in its dispute with Beijing in the event of conflict   between the two sides.

The US President also warned China against pressing its maritime   claims after it unilaterally declared an air exclusion zone over   the disputed chain of islands that both Tokyo and Beijing claim.   Chinaâ€™s dispute with Japan is historically complex and   multidimensional, more so than the disputes in the South China   Sea. Beijingâ€™s claim in its dispute with Tokyo is historically   and legally more sound, and China deeply resents Washingtonâ€™s   position on the issue.

In the Philippines, Washington and Manila inked a controversial   defense agreement to give the US government de facto   basing access in the country for a 10-year period. China   interpreted both these developments as Washington inserting   itself into matters of territory and sovereignty, which it   insists on dealing with through bilateral negotiations with the   other countries.

Beijing also believes with some justification that other   countries will be more willing to behave provocatively and   challenge Chinaâ€™s bottom line if Washington supports their   claims. China is totally opposed to any US-dominated multilateral   dispute mechanism for territorial issues, and it is also under a   high degree of domestic pressure not to be pushed around by   states like the Philippines, and by extension, the United States.

Vietnam isnâ€™t a treaty ally of the United States, and it has a   complicated history with Washington that has long prevented the   two countries forming a comprehensive partnership. China knew   that Vietnam would take offense to drilling in contested waters,   but it did so anyway to test the limits of Washington's   commitment to upholding freedom of navigation as part of the   pivot strategy.

China ultimately wants to send a message that it will not be   deterred by Washingtonâ€™s pivot and an alliance of anti-China   states that it intends to consolidate. Beijing is now willing to   openly challenge the idea that a US-led security alliance can   deter it from safeguarding what it perceives to be its   territorial integrity, and the exploitation of all the natural   resources within that territory.

Beijingâ€™s actions are intended to call Washingtonâ€™s bluff, while   being sufficiently bold, but not destabilizing enough to   compromise China's overall national security and economic   interests. A recent editorial in Chinaâ€™s state-owned Global Times   publication gives some insight into Beijingâ€™s thinking.

â€œChina faces a dilemma with its growing power. On the one   hand, it will be confronted by neighbors like Vietnam, the   Philippines and Japan, and other stakeholders like the US if it   makes use of its power,â€� claims the article. One can infer   that thinkers in Beijing view these state actors as separate   fingers on the same hand.

China clearly does not want its resolute stance to be   misinterpreted so that other states feel like they can antagonize   Beijing without consequences. The question is whether Chinaâ€™s   latest unilateral action is a one-off reaction to US policy in   the region, or the start of a fundamentality new policy line, one   that will inevitably drive the ASEAN region further into   Washingtonâ€™s corner in the years ahead.

A unified ASEAN bloc that has gravitated into Americaâ€™s security   orbit could give the next US administration a greater hand to   escalate tensions recklessly where it sees fit, through sanctions   and other mechanisms that could put economic strain on all sides.

The US, through the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal   currently being negotiated, intends to prioritize its economic   relations with the ASEAN bloc so as to reduce its dependence on   China, putting Washington in a position where future sanctions on   Beijing would not boomerang back as hard and become   destabilizing.

Beijing still sees itself as a developing country and doing   business is its top priority, so it should be conscious of the   huge power asymmetry between itself and its neighbors.

At the recent ASEAN summit, the regional organization agreed to   its first unified position on territorial disputes between China   and other regional states, which calls upon all parties to   refrain from using force and escalating tensions, in addition to   calling on both China and ASEAN to agree upon and conclude a Code   of Conduct (COC) in dealing with disputes in the South China Sea.

As the top trading partner of almost all Southeast Asian   countries, China should do its utmost to be perceived as a benign   power that can accord the same degree of rights and respect to   others as it demands for itself. It is not in Beijingâ€™s interests   to be perceived as a bully or a regional hegemon.

China should realize that the best way to keep the US pivot   policy in check is to accommodate the interests of its neighbors   by showing a willingness to reach pragmatic and mutually   beneficial solutions to territorial disputes, rather than stubbornly refusing to yield or compromise.

How many oil rigs has Vietnam been maintaining in waters disputed with China? Check out before lashing out at China over this sole wholly Chinese owned rig so near Chinese Paracel.

China has the cards to win this one...The US/Japan/EU need China's rare earths to keep their industry going, the US has such massive investment in China that the US cannot afford to loose, needs Chinese products, the US/EU need China's continuing purchases of Treasury bonds to keep their gov'ts going, China has a world class navy and airforce AND is a nuclear power, the territory in question is close to China (and its airfields) and far from US bases. My big worry, is that the US, after China humiliates it, will try to regain face by messing with Russia.
