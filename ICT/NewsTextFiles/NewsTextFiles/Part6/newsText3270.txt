
LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) - Police officers, firefighters, and emergency personnel all came to pay tribute to Oldham County officer David Howley.

Officer Howley's funeral was held at 1 p.m. Monday at Southeast Christian Church's Oldham Campus in Crestwood, where he also served as head of security on weekends.

Howley had worked with LMPD Office Peter Grignon who was also killed in the line of duty in March of 2005. Friends say after that, his family wanted him to work in a smaller department. He was also an officer for LaGrange police before coming to Oldham County Police.

Friends and family also paid respects to Howley at a visitation held Sunday. He died from a heart attack on May 14, hours after returning home from work after saying he did not feel well.

His death was later ruled to be "in the line of duty," after he made an emergency response call earlier that day.

Campus pastor Greg Allen officiated Howley's funeral and shared his best memories. Police cars put their blue flashing lights to honor Howley.

At 51 years old, Howley is survived by his wife and their daughter.

The Oldham County Judge Executive has asked that all flags in the county be flown at half-staff from dawn until dusk.
