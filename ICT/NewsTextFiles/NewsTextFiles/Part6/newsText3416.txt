
Eleven people were injured on Sunday night after a minivan careened off the road and into a sidewalk, hitting a group of pedestrians, in Tagawa, Fukuoka Prefecture.

Police said the accident occurred at around 9 p.m. as people were returning from a festival. Fuji TV quoted police as saying that a 77-year-old stallholder at the festival reached in through the window while standing outside his van and turned the key to start the engine. At that moment, the vehicle unexpectedly jolted forward onto the sidewalk hitting a number of pedestrians.
