
Police arrested a woman who reportedly attempted to set her boyfriend on fire after an argument.

Police said Saturday night, they were called to an apartment near Interstate 240 and South Walker Avenue. Police said a man at the apartment complex told authorities that he and his girlfriend had gotten into a fight.

He said she punched him and then continued to attack him. Police said Chana Reede, 27, then grabbed a bottle of lighter fluid off the pair's grill and sprayed it on the man.

The victim told officers that the woman chased him around the apartment with a lighter. He was eventually able to leave the apartment and get into a car and lock the doors.

Police said the woman followed him, but eventually went back into the apartment.

Police found the man in the vehicle with the strong odor of lighter fluid coming off his clothing.

Police said Reede told authorities that the man beat her up and put the lighter fluid on himself because he wanted her to go to jail. Police said Reede told them the victim punched her several times, but could not explain to authorities why she did not have injuries consistent with being beaten.

Police arrested Reede on suspicion of first degree arson.
