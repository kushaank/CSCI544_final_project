
COURTHOUSE � The man who was found guilty in two separate trials for the 2001 killing of his wife, Hollie Rosen, in Montgomery Township believes he should be allowed post-conviction relief.

In a court document filed with the clerk of courts on Monday, Adam Rosen stated his trial attorney, in the second trial against him in 2008, was surprised by the new forensic evidence and did not react properly when prosecutors introduced testimony from forensic pathologist Dr. Ian Hood.

�In response to this surprise testimony, trial counsel provided ineffective assistance when he (a) failed to object its introduction; (b) failed to challenge the validity of the previously undisclosed expert testimony; (c) failed to seek a postponement to secure his own expert; and (d) failed to introduce expert testimony to rebut Dr. Hood�s flawed forensic opinion,� the briefing says.

Rosen ultimately believes that his trial counsel in the 2008 re-trial was ineffective and that he should have been granted a third trial.

In March, Rosen was in court in front of Judge Demchick Alloy to argue for a third trial.

During arguments for a third trial in March, Rosen�s attorney Paul George argued that Rosen�s attorney in the 2008 bench trial, Richard Winters, was ineffective. Winters took the stand in March and told the court he was arguing that in the 2008 trial Rosen was guilty of third-degree murder and not first-degree murder. He said he tried arguing the murder was an act of rage and not something that was pre-meditated.

In 2002, Rosen was found guilty by a jury of first-degree murder and was subsequently sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. In 2008, Rosen had a bench trial in front of now retired Judge Paul Tressler. Tressler upheld the conviction from 2002.

According to a previous report, the Pennsylvania Superior Court overturned Rosen�s 2002 conviction because his first lawyer, F. Emmet Fitzpatrick Jr., did not call character witnesses to the stand.

Rosen�s bid for a third trial was denied by Judge Wendy Demchick Alloy in writing on April 10. Online court documents show Rosen has appealed the judge�s decision to the State Superior Court.
