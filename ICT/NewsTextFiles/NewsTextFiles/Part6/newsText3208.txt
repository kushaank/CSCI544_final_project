
China has built an offshore oil drilling rig, numbered HD-981, specifically for the purpose invalidating other nations’ claims to seabed they thought was theirs.  There is no doubt about the purpose of the rig given that a Chinese state oil company official once called it “our mobile national territory.”  Its primary purpose isn’t commercial.  If China can drill an oil well on some other country’s seabed, they can then claim that it was China’s territory all along.  The rig is having its first outing to that purpose off the coast of Vietnam, accompanied by 86 Chinese vessels including a submarine.  Vietnam responded by sending 30 coastguard vessels to interfere with the Chinese drilling rig.  Ramming of Vietnamese vessels by the Chinese ones has been reported.

“Relying on US support, the Philippines is so arrogant as to announce in the New Year that it will increase its navy and air force deployment at Zhongye Island, a Chinese island that it has illegally occupied for years.

“It will be an intolerable insult to China.

“According to experts, the Chinese navy has drawn a detailed combat plan to seize the island and the battle will be restricted within the South China Sea.

Zhongye Island is the Chinese name for Thitu Island.  The Philippines has a mutual defense treaty with the United States; Vietnam does not.  That is the advantage for China in starting with Vietnam first.  If the United States, and perhaps Japan, does not assist Vietnam in its coming war with China, then China is likely to decide that it can scrape the Filipino bases off their islands with impunity.

Vietnam understands what is at stake in the South China Sea.  China claims 90% of the South China Sea as part of its city of Sansha.  Once enforcement is established, ships and aircraft wanting to cross the South China Sea would have to ask China’s permission first.  Vietnamese ships sailing from Haiphong would have to hug the Vietnamese coast almost all the way down to the equator before heading east to avoid the zone.  It would add 3,500 km to the shipping distance between Haiphong and Japan, for instance.  What was open ocean to their east will become a Chinese lake.  It will be a great insult and impediment to the Vietnamese people.  That is the precise intention.

What can be done?  The best solution is to break the sequential Chinese battle plan.  Japan and Vietnam would be well advised to have their own mutual defense treaty so that China is taking on everybody at once instead of one at a time.  For Japan that means fighting China sometime later this year perhaps instead of in 2015 or 2016.  Nevertheless, taking on China and keeping East Asia free is best done as a joint effort.  By 2015 there may not be anyone left to fight alongside them.
