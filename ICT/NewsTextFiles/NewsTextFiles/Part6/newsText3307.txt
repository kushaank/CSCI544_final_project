Police in Dunedin were left scratching their heads after a cat in the city deposited a five-gram bag of cannabis at its owner's house.

Sergeant Reece Munro said a local woman had phoned the police station on Sunday evening to report that her cat had left a "bag of drugs" on the doorstep, the Otago Daily Times reported.

"You hear of cats bringing dead birds and rats home, but I've never seen anything like this before," he told the newspaper.

Sgt Munro said the origins of the cannabis, which had a street value of about $100, remained a mystery and investigations were continuing.

On the possibility of adding a feline drug-detecting division to the police force, he said "this might be something police could explore in the future".
