
The police department says it will host a donor drive Monday for Miquela Martinez, who was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease in November.

They say the disease attacks blood produced in her bone marrow.

In addition, Martinez, of Ojo Caliente, suffers from severe aplastic anemia.

Officials say the teen, who loves to snowboard and scuba dive, must be confined to a hospital bed and receives blood infusions several times a day.

Santa Fe police officers will be holding the drive from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. in front of police headquarters.

Potential donors must be between 18 and 44 years old.
