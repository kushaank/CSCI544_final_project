
A woman and her father-in-law were murdered in the capital on Sunday night, allegedly by the woman’s relatives.

According to Shahzad Town police, the woman identified as Nadia Bibi was killed because she had married of her own will. The incident occurred around 11pm on Sunday at Chapar village in Jhangi Syedan on Lehtrar Road.

“Nadia had married a man named Wasim Sabir. They contracted a court marriage around eight months ago,” said investigation officer Shams Akbar. On Sunday night, around seven people from Nadia’s family arrived at her home in Chapar and opened fire, killing Nadia and her father-in-law. It appears to be a case of honour-killing, he added.

Nadia’s family is from Nowshera and she had been living with her husband in Islamabad since her marriage. Akbar said a murder case had been registered and the police was trying to identify the attackers, one of whom might be Nadia’s maternal uncle.

No arrests had been made till the time this report was filed.
