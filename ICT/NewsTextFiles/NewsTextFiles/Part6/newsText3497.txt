NEW YORK (AP) - Former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney is calling for the resignation of a New Hampshire police commissioner who used a racial slur in describing President Barack Obama.

The former Massachusetts governor joins political leaders and residents in the New Hampshire town of Wolfeboro in asking Robert Copeland to step down.

Romney owns a home in Wolfeboro. He says in a statement, "The vile epithet used and confirmed by the commissioner has no place in our community: He should apologize and resign."

A resident says she overheard the 82-year-old Copeland use a slur in a restaurant and wrote to the town manager. Copeland acknowledged using the slur and says he will not apologize.

Officials say resignation is the only way to get Copeland out of office before his three-year term expires.
