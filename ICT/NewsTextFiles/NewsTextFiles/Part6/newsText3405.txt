
Nicolas Guaman, an immigrant from Ecuador residing in Milford, has been under investigation for a drunken accident. After running a stop sign, Guaman had hit a man on a motorcycle, Matthew Denice (age 23), then continued on, dragging the man a quarter mile. When Guaman finally stopped his vehicle, Denice was dead.

After this morning’s trial, Guaman was found not guilty of murder. He WAS however, charged with manslaughter, among several other charges. This landed him 12-14 years in prison. During his trial, however, it was found that he is a not a legal resident of the United States, which has resulted in further discussion related to immigration.

The case was a popular trend on Twitter feeds this morning; many who had been touched by the death of Matthew Denice were quick to share the news of Guaman’s imprisonment.
