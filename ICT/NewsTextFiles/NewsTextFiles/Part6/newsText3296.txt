
And turning now to South America where a tragic bus accident has claimed the lives of at least 32 people in Colombia, most of them children.

Authorities say they are still investigating the cause of the deadly bus fire on Sunday, but local media say of may have been smuggling gasoline.

The school bus was heading to a church event in northern Colombia near the town of Fundacion.

The town's mayor said that 40 to 50 young students were travelling on the bus, only accompanied by a driver, who was also killed.

Around 10 children were able to escape and are now receiving medical attention.

Witnesses who saw the fire break out, say they were powerless to help while those trapped inside struggled to get out.

President Juan Manuel Santos has expressed his condolences for the victims and traveled to the accident site.

It's the deadliest bus accident Colombia has seen since 2004, when a construction machine smashed a school bus, killing 21 children.
