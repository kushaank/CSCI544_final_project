
A vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (VBIED) was detonated on 18 May in Sabon-gari, Kano, northern Nigeria. Eyewitness reports claimed that more than 25 people were killed in attack.

The attack came a day after Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Nigeria, and Niger, together with France, made a joint declaration at a summit meeting in Paris to combat the Boko Haram insurgency that has now become a transnational threat. Boko Haram has yet to claim responsibility for the VBIED attack; however, it often takes the group close to a week to get its claims out in a video or media release.

Sabon Gari is a predominantly Christian neighbourhood and has suffered a series of Boko Haram attacks in the past.
