
A twitter troll bombarded a Labour MP with abusive messages after she supported a successful campaign to feature Jane Austen on £10 notes, a court heard yesterday.

Peter Nunn, 33, is said to have passed on the ‘menacing’ messages threatening to rape Stella Creasy and calling her an ‘evil witch’.

Miss Creasy, MP for Walthamstow, was deluged with offensive messages after she backed a high-profile social media  campaign to ensure a female face would remain on banknotes.

The court heard Nunn both retweeted and composed messages in which  campaigners were threatened.

Feminist Caroline Criado-Perez launched the Austen campaign in July after the Bank of England replaced social activist Elizabeth Fry with Sir Winston Churchill on £5 notes. The Bank then announced the Pride And Prejudice author would replace Charles Darwin on the £10 note.

Alison Morgan, prosecuting, told Westminster Magistrates’ Court Nunn ‘embarked on a campaign of hatred in various different forms towards both women’.

Nunn, it is said, then sent other offensive messages to the MP.

The  court heard that Nunn, a self-styled blogger from Bristol, also left  offensive posts in which he called the campaigners witches.

Miss  Morgan told the court that while the entries do not form part of the  criminal charge, they show the ‘hatred’ he had for the women.

When Nunn was arrested he admitted he had retweeted  messages that were violent, but said he did so ‘to further debate’.

He  denies sending a message that was grossly offensive or of an indecent,  obscene or menacing character by a public electronic network. The charge  carries a maximum sentence of six months in prison.

The case was adjourned for reports until September.
