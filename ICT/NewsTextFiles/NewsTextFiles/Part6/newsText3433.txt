
An autopsy has confirmed that a body found floating in Tampa Bay is a missing 9-year-old girl.

Felecia Williams disappeared Friday night after going to visit a family friend in Tampa. Boaters found her naked body off the Courtney Campbell Causeway near Clearwater on Saturday afternoon.

Clearwater police spokesman Rob Shaw says there were no visible signs of trauma.

Police say Eboni Wiley, 23, told them she picked Felecia up Friday and they went to her apartment. She told police she discovered Felecia missing when she got out of the shower but didn't alert authorities for five hours.

Wiley was arrested Sunday on a charge of making false statements to law enforcement. She was released on a $2,000 bail.
