
A Massachusetts woman called in fake bomb threats Sunday in an attempt to keep her family from discovering she had dropped out of school and wouldn’t be graduating.

Danielle Shea was a student at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn. until 2012. Her family thought she was still enrolled and would be graduating on Sunday.

When Shea’s mother noticed her daughter’s name wasn’t on the graduation program, Shea panicked and called in a bomb threat to cancel graduation, police said.

Shea told Hamden and Quinnipiac police there were several bombs on campus.

“You haven’t cleared out graduation. That’s not a good idea,” she told police.

Police traced the threats to Shea’s phone. They found her in the arena where more than 5,000 people were waiting for graduation to begin.

Police arrested Shea in her graduation cap and gown.

She is charged with threatening in the first degree and falsely reporting an incident.
