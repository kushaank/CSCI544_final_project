
The father of Lawrence Asiamah Hanson a.k.a Bulldog says his son is innocent of the crime he is suspected to have committed. Mr. Jacob Hanson told Citi News, his son, who is currently in the custody of the Criminal and Investigative Department (CID) of the Ghana Police Service, is being unlawfully held by the Police.

The Police Homicide Unit of the CID on Thursday arrested Bulldog  as the prime suspect in investigations of the murder of Fennec Okyere, who managed Hiplife artiste, Kwaw Kesse. According to the Police, Bulldog allegedly sent threatening text messages to the deceased and also publicly threatened him on live radio, hence; his arrest.

A private legal practitioner, Kwame Akuffo, in an earlier interview with Citi News however mentioned that, the basis on which the Police arrested Bulldog is untenable adding that, it is wrong for the Police to tag him as a suspect. Speaking to Citi News, a devastated Jacob Hanson agreed with lawyer Akuffo’s stance on the matter.

In March, 2014, some unknown assailants stabbed Fennec to death in his private off the Spintex Road, Accra.

The Police subsequently offered a cash reward of GHC 20,000 to any person or persons who will volunteer credible information leading to the arrest of suspects involved in the murder of Fennec Okyere.
