
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A man accused of robbing a woman and kicking her in the head in a brutal attack during San Francisco's gay pride festivities has been sentenced to six years in prison.

Police say surveillance video of the June 30 attack shows 23-year-old Oakland resident Christopher Porter-Bailey kick the woman in the face while she is on the ground, seemingly for no reason. The woman had been robbed of her purse and cellphone.

The woman was knocked unconscious and suffered a concussion and other injuries.

A jury convicted Porter-Bailey in February of robbery, assault and battery with serious injury. Prosecutors tell the San Francisco Chronicle a judge sentenced him on Friday to a six-year term.
