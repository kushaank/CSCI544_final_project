PETALING JAYA: Suria KLCC is investigating the CCTV footage at the loading bay area where a cat was allegedly found tied up.

However, a representative told The Star Online that they have yet to find any details of the whereabouts and the condition of the cat.

"So far, we haven't found anything because we do not know the exact spot.

It would be better if the person who first found the cat comes forward and informs us," she said on Monday.

A photo of a cat with its hind legs tied up on the floor, believed to be at the loading bay entrance, has gone viral since it was posted at 11am, Sunday.

According to Facebook user Mandy Chow, the cat got fierce and defensive when she tried to rescue it.

Netizen Tati Tot Tot commented: "The string is disrupting the blood circulation to his leg, and the foot is swollen".

Some animal lovers had tried to rescue the animal but the cat could not be located when they arrived at the supposed area.

Malaysian Dogs Deserve Better (MDDB), who shared the photo and asked for help from the public, said they would continue putting up alerts so the cat could be found.

"It's truly frightening to know the extent of cruelty against animals here.

"This is due to the lack of deterrence imposed against animal abuse perpetrators," said MDDB project manager Melinda Joy Gomez, in a statement.

She also urged those who chance upon an injured animal to help it first before alerting rescue groups.

"This is because most of the time when rescuers get there hours later, the injured animal is no longer there," she added.

Please wait.
