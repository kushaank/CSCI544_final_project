
HAMPSHIRE – Police won't file charges after investigating a possible inappropriate relationship between a Hampshire High School teacher and student, Hampshire police said.

Police Chief Brian Thompson said in a statement that they did not have sufficient evidence to support a criminal charge after talking with the Kane County State's Attorney's Office.

Police first obtained search warrants for the investigation in late April after a friend of the male student told the principal about the possible relationship, court records showed.

A 23-year-old female Hampshire High teacher reportedly performed sex acts on the then-17-year-old male student and also provided him answers to her tests, according to testimonies documented in a search warrant issued to obtain the teacher's phone.

The friend – who said he learned of the incidents some time in 2013 before winter – said that the teacher declined to have sex with the student because he was not yet 18, the warrant said.

The student involved told police the sex act was performed between late January and early February, according to the warrant. The student turned 18 in late January.

The age of consent in Illinois is 17, but 18 when the acts involve teachers or individuals in a position of authority over youth.

When police went to obtain the teacher's cell phone in late April, officers asked her whether an investigation would reveal a relationship of a sexual nature. She replied, "could be," and then asked for an attorney, court records showed.

Carpentersville-based District 300 placed the teacher on paid administrative leave with the investigation ongoing.

The teacher remains on leave, said spokeswoman Allison Strupeck. She would not comment on whether the teacher would be reinstated.
