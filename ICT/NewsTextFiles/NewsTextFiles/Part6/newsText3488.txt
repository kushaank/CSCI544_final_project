
A search for a Rangitikei man who has been missing for nearly       a week has been suspended.

Stephen Walker was last seen at his Bulls home last Wednesday       at 8.30pm.

Searchers had completed a thorough search of the area, a       police spokeswoman said today.

They had now pulled back from the search today until police       had further information relating to Mr Walker's whereabouts.

‘‘We are also working closely with his family to ascertain       his day to day patterns and what frame of mind he was in when       he was last seen," she said.

The 25-year-old is the brother of Pete and Andy Walker, fan       favourites on TV3's The Block NZ television show, which       screened last year.

A blue Suzuki TF125 farm motorbike that Mr Walker was       believed to be travelling on was found on Makoura Rd, Apiti.

Officer in charge of the search Sergeant Andy Brooke earlier       said police were concerned for his welfare.
