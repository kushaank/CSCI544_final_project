
After playing the video below with our headphones cranked up to eleven, we've come to a surprising conclusion. The black and badgeless Stang doesn't sound like it's powered by a thunderous all-American V8, nor a throaty six-cylinder mill. Besides, the vehicle doesn't feature the quad exhaust of the recently spied GT350 test mule, but a two tip job.

Couple the above with the raspy exhaust note and the obvious forced induction sound and you get a beefed up version of the 2.3-liter four-pot EcoBoost-powered Stang . If we're lucky and Ford marketing people feel a bit inspired, maybe it'll bear the iconic SVO moniker.

Every hardcore Mustang enthusiast will remember that the Blue Oval last used the SVO nameplate on the turbocharged Mustang built between 1984 through 1986. Amusingly, the four-cylinder churned out 175 to 205 horsepower, making the SVO the fastest Mustang in the lineup.

Slated to arrive in dealer showrooms this fall, the 2015 Ford Mustang EcoBoost can be kitted out with a Performance Package . For $1,995, customers will be offered all kinds of performance-oriented components and tuning, like a larger radiator, bigger brake rotors, specially tuned electronic driving aids and a 3.55 limited-slip differential.

Fingers crossed Ford will do the right thing and offer a dedicated Mustang variant or at least a Performance Pack bearing the SVO name, with more go-faster goodies and power that the EcoBoost's 305 horsepower and 300 lb-ft (407 Nm) of torque.
