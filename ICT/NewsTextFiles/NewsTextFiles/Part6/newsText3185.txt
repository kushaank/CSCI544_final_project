
Gritty drug saga “Breaking Bad“ on Monday won the best drama series award at the Primetime Emmys, US television’s highest honours.

China has described as “made up” US accusations of cyber-espionage against five of its military personnel in the United States.

It is the first time the Americans have publically accused China of cyber-espionage on US soil. The Department of Justice and FBI seem sure they have “smoking keyboards” that prove their case in a  court of law. The FBI has issued a wanted poster with the five suspects identified.

“This is a case alleging economic espionage by members of the Chinese military. The range of trade secrets and other sensitive business information stolen in this case is significant and demands an agressive response. We must say ‘enough is enough’.

This administration will not tolerate actions by any nation that seek to illegally sabotage American companies and undermine the integrity of fair competition in the operation of the free market,” said US Attorney General Eric Holder.

The five Chinese officers are accused of spying on, among others Alcoa, Westinghouse, United Steel, and US subsidiaries of SolarWorld AG.

The FBI has warned global media to expect several high-profile cyber-security related cases involving indictments and arrests in the weeks to come.
