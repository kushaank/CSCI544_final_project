
An elderly woman has died in hospital after a car crash in Manawatu.

Ngaire Riddell, 82, was travelling toward Ashhurst on Colyton Rd on Wednesday April 30 when her vehicle, a Toyota Corona, veered off the road about 3pm.

A member of the public came to the Riddell's aid and immediately called emergency services.

Riddell suffered serious injuries, including multiple fractures, and was taken to Palmerston North Hospital's intensive care unit.

The woman passed away in the hospital on Thursday in the presence of her family.

At the time police were unsure of the cause of the crash, but the woman was alone in the vehicle, it was mechanically sound, and no other vehicles were involved.

The woman, from Tauranga, was travelling through the area to visit family in Wairarapa when she crossed the centre line, ran into a ditch and struck some trees, Ashhurst constable Nick James said.

She was trapped in the vehicle for some time and was cut out by the Feilding Volunteer Fire Brigade.

The Serious Crash Unit was continuing to investigate and the matter has been referred to the Coroner.

Yes - and I got out before my destination.

Yes, but it turned out fine.

No, never a problem.

No, but I'll never travel alone in one.
