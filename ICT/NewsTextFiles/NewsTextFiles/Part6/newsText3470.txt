
HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (WSAZ) -- A second woman has been arrested and charged in connection with an overdose death in Huntington.

Angela Jarvis, 38, of Milton, was arraigned Monday afternoon on a first-degree murder charge.

Huntington Police say Jarvis sold narcotics to Racheal Chaney, which led to her death hours later.

Chaney died Feb. 7. She was 28 years old.

Jarvis is being held without bond.

Chaney's girlfriend, Misty Chapman, 27, was also charged with first-degree murder. She was picked up last week.

Police say she also contributed to the overdose. Chapman told WSAZ.com that she helped Chaney get the needle in her arm, but did not inject her with drugs.

"She helped me raise my kids for four years,” Chapman said in Magistrate Court on Wednesday. “I partied with her. She died, and I woke up. I can't help that."

According to the criminal complaint, Jarvis sold two of the narcotics to Chaney and Chapman, and those narcotics were determined to be contributing factors to Chaney’s death.

Police say Jarvis confessed.
