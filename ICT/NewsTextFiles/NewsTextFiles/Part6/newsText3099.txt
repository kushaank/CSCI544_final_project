
Kyrgyz president Almazbek Atambayev was welcomed by a 21-gun salute on Sunday on his visit to China for the upcoming Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) summit in Shanghai. This is the first time China has allowed an artillery salute to take place outside of Beijing.

Cannon, officers, soldiers and equipment made the 1000-kilometer-plus trip to Shanghai from the capital via an exclusive train.

The honorary artillery is under the purview of the Armed Police Corps. Since it was established in 1984, the contingent has been saluted over 600 times.
