
CHARLESTON, W.Va. (WSAZ) -- Charleston City Council on Monday approved a grant application to the Bureau of Justice for the purchase of new police equipment.

If the application is approved, more than $136,000 will go to the Charleston Police Department and the Kanawha County Sheriff's Department.

Council members say with the money provided, the CPD will be able to buy weapon mounted lights and Tasers.

The grant also would allow drug enforcement overtime for the police department and the sheriff's department.

"We want to give our officers the best equipment that they can possibly get for their safety and to do their jobs properly and safely, and I think it benefits the community because they get to be exposed to the best tools as possible," Charleston Police Department Brent Webster said.
