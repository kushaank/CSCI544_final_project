
Land grabbers are a unique group of people. They not only grab land from their owners, but also act as if they had owned that land for decades. They start out by identifying high-value properties whose owners are weak – widows, retired persons etc. At odd hours, especially when the police are busy in duty shifts, these people will attack the targeted property as a group. Within half an hour, some of the group will lock the actual owners in a room, while their partners would quickly empty out a couple of room, throwing the actual owners’ stuff out. Then they will quickly fill these emptied out rooms with their own household stuff, furniture and even baby clothes and toys.

These land grabbers are accompanied by women and children, who start living in the newly acquired rooms. This whole operation is conducted quickly, so that by the time the police party arrives, the land grabbers are already settled in their rooms. They also come prepared with fake property documents, which they show to the police. Since the police do not have the capacity to assess actual and fake documents, they are left with no other option but to refer the case to the courts. These land grabbers take advantage of the loopholes in the police investigation and slow court systems to exploit weak people. Digitising land records is one way to stop this problem, but we also need to improve the court systems of Pakistan.
