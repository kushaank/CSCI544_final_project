
“China has previously rejected all such discussions,” said Agriculture and Agro-based Industries Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob.

He said the latest development was expressed to him by his Chinese counterpart during Ismail’s trip to China last week.

“To all swiflet farmers and bird’s nest entrepreneurs who worry about not being able to export their products, there is now hope,” Ismail said after the ministry’s monthly staff gathering here yesterday.

“China has agreed to enter into a discussion with us and we will send our officers to follow up on this,” he added.

China’s General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) has allowed the re-entry of cleaned bird’s nests from Malaysia after lifting a two-year freeze on the product.

The ban, which was lifted on Dec 25 last year, was put in place in July 2011 when cleaned bird’s nests from Malaysia were found to contain excessive level of nitrite.

The Malaysian bird’s nest industry is a lucrative sector, which saw some 250 tonnes of bird’s nests exported to China before the ban was imposed.

On a separate matter, Ismail highlighted an urgent need for more young people to participate in agriculture entrepreneurship.

He said only about 15% of the country’s 800,000 farmers consisted of youngsters.

“The rest are mostly above 60 years old,” he pointed out.

“If the young do not get involve in agriculture, there will be no one to take over when the need arises,” Ismail said.
