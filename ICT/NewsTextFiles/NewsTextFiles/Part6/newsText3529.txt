A man has been charged with the murders of two women thought to be a mother and daughter after they were found dead with stab wounds in west Auckland.

The 55-year-old was charged on Tuesday morning and would appear in Waitakere District Court.

The names of the women will be released once formal identification has taken place, police said in a statement.

On Monday, police were called to the address in Pooks Road, Ranui about 10am after the male occupant of the home rang emergency services.

They found a woman in her mid 50s and a younger woman in her late teens dead and it appeared they had recently been stabbed, Detective Inspector Greg Cramer told media.

The dead women were from Pakistan.
