"This is a sovereign decision of Kyrgyzstan to join or not these or other associations. We have been negotiating on this issue with the Chinese side. China has a positive attitude: if it benefits the country, of course, they will support us. They are ready to continue and deepen the cooperation with us. Today the CU members are Russia and Kazakhstan. And their relationship with China is strengthening. I hope that the same approach will be with us,' the Minister said.
