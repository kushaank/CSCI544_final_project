
Maryland State police said troopers stopped hundreds of drivers along Interstate 95 during a multi-state traffic enforcement blitz.

Police announced Monday that troopers made over 300 stops on Saturday during the operation linked to the “Drive to Save Lives” initiative from Maine to Florida along the interstate highway.

Over eight hours, police said, troopers issued 273 citations and 145 warnings for violations including improper cellphone use, failing to obey the move over law, following too closely, unsafe lane changing, aggressive driving as well as speeding.  Troopers also made two drug arrests and four warrant arrests.

The effort is part of ongoing support for the “Move Toward Zero Deaths” campaign, in cooperation with the Maryland Highway Safety Office, police said.
