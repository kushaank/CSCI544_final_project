
The number of multiple sclerosis (MS) prevalent cases across the ten  major markets (10MM) will increase from 904,908 in 2013 to 940,413 by  2023, at an Annual Growth Rate (AGR) of 0.39%, says research and  consulting firm The authors.

Among the 10MM (the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK,  Japan, China and India), India will have the highest increase in  prevalent cases, with an AGR of almost 2%, followed by Spain and China,  with AGRs of 1.05% and 0.93%, respectively.

Despite having lower AGRs, The authors epidemiologists forecast that the  US will have the highest number of prevalent cases of MS by 2023, with  303,343, followed by Canada with 142,199 and Germany with 140,209.

Suman Morampudi, MPH, Senior Epidemiologist, says: Regional differences  in MS prevalence and incidence could be due to several factors,  including the differing diagnostic criteria used, the availability of  medical technology, genetic and environmental risk factors, the  frequency of comorbidities, and population age and sex structures.

Although China and India had significantly lower MS incidence rates than  the other countries in 2013, their large population sizes are the main  factor contributing to their high number of incident cases, according to  The authors.

Morampudi continues: With less availability of diagnostic MRI technology  in China and India, compared with western countries, case ascertainment  in these countries is not as precise. Less accurate case diagnosis can  result in diseases, such as neuromyelitis optica, being misclassified as  MS, and may have resulted in an overestimation of the latter's incidence  in China and India.

Low MS prevalence proportions in these countries could also be related  to the genetic makeup of these populations, as MS is more commonly  diagnosed in Caucasians than individuals of any other race/ethnicity.  This is even the case in western countries where MRI technology is  widely available.

- The Multiple Sclerosis (MS) EpiCast Report provides an overview of the  risk factors and comorbidities, and global and historical trends of MS  in the 10 major markets (10MM) (the US, France, Germany, Italy, Spain,  the UK, Japan, Canada, China and India). It includes a 10-year  epidemiological forecast of MS prevalent and incident cases segmented by  sex and age (in five-year increments beginning at 20 years and ending at  =85 years) in these markets.

- The MS epidemiology report is written and developed by Masters- and  PhD-level epidemiologists.

- The EpiCast Report is in-depth, high quality, transparent and  market-driven, providing expert analysis of disease trends in the 10MM.
