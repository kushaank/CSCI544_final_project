
A man is assisting police after two women thought to be a mother and daughter were found dead with stab wounds in west Auckland.

Police were called to the address in Pooks Road, Ranui about 10am after the male occupant of the home rang emergency services.

Upon arriving they found a woman in her mid 50s and a younger woman in her late teens dead and it appeared they had been stabbed, Detective Inspector Greg Cramer said.

"We believe the events relating to this situation have unfolded this morning," he said.

Det Insp Cramer wouldn't say what the relationship was between the deceased and the man police are talking with, except that they were of Pakistani ethnicity and believed to have a family relationship.

Neighbours said the house was occupied by a couple and their daughter.

Det Insp Cramer said it was being treated as a double homicide, and that nobody else was being sought by police.

Police had not been called to the house before, he said.

Neighbour Rob Nixon said a mother, father and daughter lived at the address, and there were two sons who came occasionally.

He saw the father in the back of a vehicle afterwards being treated by ambulance staff, with three police officers in close attendance.

Mr Nixon told NZ Newswire he wasn't aware anything happened at the address - one of a number of attached homes - until police arrived.

"If somebody walks up and down the stairs next door you can hear them, but I and my wife heard nothing."

The bodies were still at the home on late Monday afternoon. They were expected to be removed on Monday evening and a post mortem examination is scheduled for Tuesday.
