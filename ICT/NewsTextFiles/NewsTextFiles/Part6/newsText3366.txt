
Activists say these four teens were racially profiled and wrongly accused in a robbery.

Some local advocates think so.

A group of about 20 people protested at 6th St. and Jefferson today as part of the Correct and Protect Rally.

The rally was sponsored by the Kentucky Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression.

The group said 21-year-old Jerron Bush, 20-year-old Craig Dean, 18-year-old Shaquazz Allen and 19-year-old Tyrone Booker were racially profiled and wrongly charged with a robbery on the night of the March 22 mob attacks.

"Sprint cell phone records conclude that these young men were not on the scene at the time these crimes were committed. They were visiting their cousin in west Louisville on 39th and Market Street," said Kathleen Parks.

Leaders say the teens were not on surveillance video from the night of the attacks.

Parks also said the group is trying to arrange a meeting with LMPD 's Chief of Police to discuss the cases.
