
Gamesa has signed a 100 MW turbine supply agreement with CGN Wind Energy for a wind farm being developed in the province of Yunnan, China.

The turbine maker says the scope of the agreement encompasses the supply and installation of 50 G97-2.0 MW units, specifically configured for high-altitude locations, at the Yangchajie wind complex. Gamesa expects to fulfill the order by the last quarter of this year.

In addition, Gamesa and CGN, a subsidiary of China's General Nuclear Power Group, have agreed to the potential supply of another 100 MW during a second phase of the project in 2015.

In China, Gamesa says it has installed 3.5 GW of wind power to date and currently services more than 850 MW.
