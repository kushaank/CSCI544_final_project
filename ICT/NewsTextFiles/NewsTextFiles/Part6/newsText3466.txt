
A South African elephant sanctuary, Elephants of Eden, has been charged with cruelty to elephants. Baby elephants and juveniles were recorded being trained with an electric cattle prod, whipped with a bull-hook and punished by being chained and stretched.  The directors and management of the sanctuary are being charged following an investigation by South Africa’s National Council of Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA).

The owners of Elephants of Eden also operate a second elephant sanctuary called Knysna Elephant Park.

Video seen by the NSPCC included baby elephants and young juveniles being chained down by the feet before being stretched and then hit with bull-hooks or receiving electric shocks from cattle prods.

Lizette Withers who owns the sanctuary and the Knysna Elephant Park has also been charged with obstruction after she refused to allow NSPCC inspectors access to the Elephants of Eden sanctuary. The NSPCC had to call on police assistance to carry out a warrant to investigate the claims.

South Africa currently have no laws to control training methods of elephants and trainers need no qualifications or accreditation as too competence. This opens up the opportunity for abuse of the animals.

A growing number of people in South Africa and around the world have suffered severe and fatal injuries as a result of the rebellion of trained elephants kept in captivity. Elephants of Eden and the Knysna Elephant Park are no exceptions: – at these facilities two elephant handlers have been killed and others have been seriously injured. The most recent case occurred in 2011.
