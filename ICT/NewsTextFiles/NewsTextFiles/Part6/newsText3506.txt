
Two men have been arrested for dumping a cardboard box containing the remains of five different dogs in a public park in Sapporo in March of this year, police said Monday.

According to police, Shogo Hoshi, 23, who is unemployed, and Masayuki Akiba, a 20-year-old contract employee, have been charged with violation of waste management laws. Fuji TV reported that the bodies of five dogs including a chihuahua and a beagle, were found inside a cardboard box in the public park in Toyohira Ward on the morning of March 15.

The person who found the box was quoted by police as saying, “I thought that perhaps the box contained some kind of animal, so I went to pick it up. When I did, the bottom of the box broke and that is when the bodies of the dogs fell out onto the ground,” Fuji reported.

Officials who inspected the remains said that some of the dogs showed signs of having been in a state of near starvation before their death. Police said they may also charge the suspects with animal cruelty.
