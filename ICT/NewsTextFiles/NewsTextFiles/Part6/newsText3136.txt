Gross profit margin was 7.4% for the first quarter 2014, compared to 4.0% for the first quarter 2013. The positive change in the gross profit margin was mostly attributable to the higher profit margin generated from the international trade business through the Company's newly established New York subsidiary.

The significant decrease in the SG&A expenses for the first quarter 2014 was primarily due to the Company's focus on reducing personnel cost and new store renovation expenses.

Net income from continuing operation was recorded at $101,989 for the first quarter 2014, compared to a net loss of $ (550,682) for the first quarter 2013.  Most noticeably, this is the first time since 2009 the Company reported positive quarterly net income from continuing operations.

"The first quarter 2014 was a turning point for Yosen. For the first time since 2009, Yosen reported positive quarterly operating income and net income." Yosen's CEO Mr. Zhenggang Wang commented. "We are pleased to report our solid sales growth this quarter compared to the first quarter 2013.  Yosen has closed many low-efficiency stores and cut excessive personnel over the last few years when facing a fiercely competitive market.  For this business realignment, we paid a high price over time.  Thanks to the innovative cooperation with China's three largest telecom operators (China Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicom), Yosen was able to reposition itself successfully in the competitive 3C market.  Today, we have seen encouraging results from realigning our 3C portfolio to include the best-selling products of Apple and Samsung, choosing best retail locations, accomplishing cost savings through telecom operator subsidies, and providing our customers one-stop shopping convenience. With all these efforts, we are very pleased to announce our solid sales growth as a result, and particularly, for the first time since 2009 we realized positive quarterly net income."

 "We had a strong start in our international trade business, which contributed to our total portfolio a high profit margin.  Although it had only two months in operations in the first quarter, our New York subsidiary has already realized revenue of $607,976.  In the remainder of 2014, we anticipate to continue dedicating more resources to grow the international trade business.  Our primary focus in the near future will be to execute the exclusive agreement with Yiwu China Commodity City Information Technology Ltd., as announced in the previous press release.  Our successful execution of this agreement will bring Yosen tremendous opportunities to cooperate with other large-scale corporations, trade organizations and municipalities in cross border trade and e-commerce.  "

"I strongly believe that Yosen is well-positioned for an even better future," added Mr. Wang.
