You'd be surprised how far some thieves will go to get your money. Investigators in New Jersey are searching for one man who installed various skimming devices onto an ATM machine in an effort to obtain the account information of bank customers.    Police say the suspect was captured on surveillance footage, carefully placing the equipment on an ATM located inside the Bank of America in Marlton.   "It took just under a minute for this man to install a magnetic strip reader like the one you see here and a tiny pinhole camera onto the ATM machine." [WCAU]  Fortunately, a very alert customer noticed small wires protruding from where the adhesive was holding the camera in place. That bank patron alerted police, who in turn reviewed the surveillance tape.   Local investigators have released the images of the suspect. They also reached out to the FBI for assistance in locating him.   For now, ATM users are being asked to cover the keypad with their hand so their pin entry can't be seen. They're also urged to inspect the ATM for wires and adhesive prior to using it.
