
CRANSTON, RI — The police have arrested two alleged gang members from Providence in a Mother’s Day incident in which a brick was thrown through the front window of a house and an attempted shooting apparently was foiled by a misfire.

Police Chief Kevin M. Barry on Monday announced the arrests of Davon McMahon, 19, of Grafton Street,  and Jorge Velazquez, 18, of Hilarity Street, both of Providence.

He said both were charged with assault with intent to commit a felony, using a firearm in a crime of violence, conspiracy and three counts of vandalism/malicious damage to property. They were arraigned and are being held at the Adult Correctional Institutions, according to the police.

The police went to a house at 13 Roland Ave. during the early-morning hours of May 11 in response to a 911 call about an attempted shooting and vandalism. An investigation determined, according to the police, that McMahon and Velazquez vandalized several motor vehicles parked in the driveway and that one of them threw a brick through the window.

The suspects got into a car and then a man came out of the house to check the damage, the police said. From the car, Velazquez unsuccessfully tried several times to fire a handgun at the man but the gun did not go off, and then the suspects fled, the police alleged.

The police said the suspects are members of a Providence street gang and that 13 Roland Ave. has been the scene of previous gang-related incidents.

When the arrests occurred was not immediately available.

The case has been investigated by police from Cranston and Providence as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation Safe Streets Task Force. Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call the Cranston police Detective Bureau at (401) 477-5143.
