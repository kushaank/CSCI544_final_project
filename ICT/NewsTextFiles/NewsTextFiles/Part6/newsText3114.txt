
Middletown residents Mike and Theresa Fox will appear as contestants on Tuesday's episode of the CBS game show "Let's Make A Deal."

Middletown, Del.

Robert “Mike” Fox and his wife, Theresa, are such big fans of “Let’s Make A Deal” that they regularly tape the daytime game show so they can watch it together at night.

Which is exactly how the Middletown couple plan to watch Tuesday’s episode, when they will make their television debut as contestants on the popular CBS program.

“It will be fun to see ourselves, but we lived it, so we know how it’s going to turn out,” said Mike, a 63-year-old resident of the Back Creek neighborhood.

For now, Mike can’t reveal what he knows about the couple’s performance, but he does promise that it will be worth watching.

Mike, a chief financial officer for a Maryland-based financial services company, and Theresa, who works in the Delaware City Post Office, actually taped the episode last November during a stopover in Los Angeles at the tail end of a “bucket list” trip to China.

“We were already in the area so we decided to check something else off of our always-wanted-to-do list and got tickets to the show,” he said.

The couple made up their wacky costumes – a hallmark of the show’s audience members – from items they collected during their trip to China.

Contestants on the program are selected at random and something about the local couple caught the eye of Wayne Brady, who has hosted the latest incarnation of the long-running game show since 2009.

Except Mike and Theresa won’t be just regular folks much longer.

Be sure to tune in to “Let’s Make A Deal” at 10 a.m. to see whether Mike and Theresa got “Zonked” or went home with a big prize.
