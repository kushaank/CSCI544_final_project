A student pursuing final-year B.Tech, I volunteered for the elections work, because of which I could not cast my vote on the day of polling. When I asked the police, they asked me to apply for a postal ballot, and guided me to the GHMC office at Malkajgiri. Officials there asked me to go to the Medchal office. As I could not go that far, I filed a complaint on the Election Commission website a week ago, and the status of the complaint remains pending. As a citizen of India, I must vote. But I am helpless.
