
BLOOMINGTON — A 23-year-old woman told a jury the details Monday of a 2012 encounter with a stranger she has accused of sexually assaulting her and stealing money from her home.

The Pantagraph does not identify the alleged victims of sex offenses.

First Assistant Bill Workman said in opening statements that Barron's version of events evolved as he spoke with police after the suspect was identified by the woman in a campus security video.

"He went from 'No, I was never in that place to yes, but it was an accident,'" said Workman.

Barron's lawyer Kim Klein of Chicago said the defense agrees with many details laid out in the state's case.

"However there's more to this case than that," Klein told the jury.

Barron "made a mistake, a very big mistake," but he did not commit the charges leveled by the state, said Klein, who is assisted at the trial by Bloomington lawyer Stephanie Wong.

Klein told jurors Barron, who was an ISU freshman at the time of the incident but no longer attends the university, will testify and tell his side of the incident.

The trial will continue Tuesday with police officers expected to testify. The jury also will see Barron's video taped statement to police.
