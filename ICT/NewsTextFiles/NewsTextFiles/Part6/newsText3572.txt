Hacked. The United States outed five Chinese military officials for hacking into U.S. companies in state-sponsored cyberattacks. A federal court indictment announced Monday accuses the hackers of stealing trade secrets from companies such as U.S. Steel Corp., Westinghouse Electric Co., and Alcoa. There is virtually no chance the Chinese government would hand over the accused officials for prosecution, but the indictment calls attention to the problem of cyberespionage and the vulnerability of U.S. information.

Pomp and circumstance. A college dropout is accused of calling in bomb threats to Quinnipiac University when her plan to fake her graduation fell apart over the weekend. Danielle Shea of Quincy, Mass., didnâ€™t go to college last year, but her mother paid thousands of dollars for what she thought was her daughterâ€™s education.

Long, hot summer. Firefighters who conquered a series of wildfires in San Diego County expect they will have little time to rest before the next blaze ignites in drought-plagued California. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection has already responded to more than 1,500 fires this year, compared with about 800 during an average year. â€œNormally, I donâ€™t even put wildfire gear in my vehicle until the end of April. This year I never took it out,â€� Kirk Kushen, battalion chief of the Kern County Fire Department, said at a base camp in Escondido. California Gov. Jerry Brown said Sunday the state is preparing for what could be its worst fire season ever.
