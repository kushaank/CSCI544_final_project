
A man who fired shots at deputies early Monday when they responded to a dispute at his home in Masaryktown is dead from a gunshot wound, according to the Hernando County Sheriff’s Office.

It was not clear whether the shooting was self inflicted or the result of returned fire from the Hernando County Sheriff’s Office, said Corp. Jennifer Picardi, spokeswoman for the sheriff’s office.

Robert Sharp, 56, threatened suicide following a dispute with his wife at their home, 18385 Benes Roush Road, deputies said.

Deputies arrived about 12:15 a.m. and heard several shots being fired inside the home.

While trying to make contact with Sharp, he fired several shots toward deputies before retreating into his home, according to the sheriff’s office.

Sharp came back out later and fired a second round of shots at deputies, who returned fire, according to the sheriff’s office. Sharp again retreated into his home.

No deputies were injured. Sharp’s wife fled the residence prior to the deputies’ arrival and was not injured, deputies said.

A Hernando County SWAT team was called to the home and spent several hours trying to communicate with Sharp.

Just after 7 a.m., the team searched the home and found Sharp’s body, Picardi said.

The sheriff’s office and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement are investigating the incident as a deputy-related shooting, according to the sheriff’s office.
