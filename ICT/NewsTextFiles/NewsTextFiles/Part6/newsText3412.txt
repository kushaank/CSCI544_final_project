NYNGAN: Police and ambulance were called to a motorcycle crash at the ‘Tottie Tracks’ on Monday May 4 where a 20-year-old rider was reported unconscious and not breathing.

It is timely to remind the community that the Tottie Tracks and most of the land outside the levee bank is Crown land and travelling stock route and therefore off limits to unlicensed riders and unregistered motorcycles.

About 3.30am on Saturday May 10 police were conducting routine patrols of Nyngan when they observed a shirtless male in the middle of the street.

Police returned to the man who was arrested and charged with malicious damage.

Any urgent matters should be reported by calling Triple 0 (000) and non-urgent matters reported by calling Nyngan Police Station on 6831 1399 or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
