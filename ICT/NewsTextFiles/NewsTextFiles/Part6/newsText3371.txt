
A fiery crash that killed two high school sweethearts in Louisiana last week has taken an even more sinister twist after a witness came forward to say that the young couple were being chased when their truck slammed into a tree and exploded.

Blake Fritz, 20, and Megan Rogers, 19, were both home from college when they died May 14 in their hometown of Shreveport, Louisiana. Their bodies were so badly burned in the wreck that authorities had trouble identifying who they were.

Mr Leslie told KSLA-TV that he was awakened by the sound of a revving engine and then the sickening crumple of the truck smashing into a tree.

He ran outside to find a fireball crash.

But he saw something else - two other pickup trucks that had stopped on the street.

Then, they drove off, Mr Leslie said.

'I think that somebody was chasing this Blake Fritz. And he got really scared enough to take the risk that he took,' he told KSLA.

Police say the truck was traveling at least 50mph when it crashed - twice the posted speed limit for the narrow residential street.

Mr Leslie said Fritz's father told him that his son carried spare gas cans in the bed of his pickup truck. He believes that contributed to the fireball.

Mr Leslie said he has not spoke to the police about what he saw - but he would be willing to.

Fritz was a student at the University of Louisiana-Lafayette. Rogers had just finished her freshman year at Louisiana State University. They had been dating since Rogers was a junior in high school.

'(Megan) never met a soul she didnâ€™t love. She was a wonderful, beautiful Christian girl,' her father Kent Rogers told the Shreveport Times .
