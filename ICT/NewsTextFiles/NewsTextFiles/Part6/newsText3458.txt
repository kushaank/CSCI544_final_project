
A 4-year-old boy who accidentally shot himself after he found a .25-caliber pistol last week has died, according to the Dorchester County Coroner's Office.

Coroner Chris Nisbet identified the boy as Jeffery Scott of Otranto Road in North Charleston. He died Friday afternoon at Medical University Hospital, where he was being treated following the May 12 incident.

Nisbet has ruled his death an accident.

Summerville Police Capt. Jon Rogers said detectives are still trying to determine who owned the gun. The case remains under investigation, and no criminal charges have been filed, he said.

The boy's 75-year-old grandmother, Margaret G. Wilson, called 911 around 4:40 p.m. on May 12 to report the shooting at 811 W. Richardson Ave.

She later told police that she had just returned home with the boy and was putting away groceries when she heard the lone gunshot.

Wilson rushed outside and found the boy lying in the front yard. He was bleeding from a wound to his head, the report stated.

The pistol rested nearby.

"I don't know where he got a gun from," Wilson told the 911 dispatcher. "Somebody, please come. Come quick."

The boy wasn't breathing, his grandmother told the dispatcher. Scott's eyes were closed.

No one else was home at the time, Rogers said. The boy was visiting.

Paramedics, firefighters and a deputy from the Dorchester County Sheriff's Office were already there when Summerville police officers showed up.

By then, the .25-caliber Taurus pistol had been placed on the dining room table, and the boy was lying on the floor.

A helicopter later flew him to a Charleston hospital.
