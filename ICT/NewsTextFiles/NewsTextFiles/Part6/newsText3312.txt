A PHOTO of the bloodied body of Townsville man Cleveland Clay has been shown to jurors in the Maryborough Supreme Court.

The picture showed the man lying on the ground, with timber poking out from beneath his body and another piece on the ground nearby.

Maryborough man Simeon Blair has pleaded not guilty to murdering him on April 28, 2012 in an alleged attack at the Carlton Hotel.

The picture was shown while witness Dr Paul Anderson was being questioned by the prosecution about the wood.

Dr Anderson was called to the Maryborough police watchhouse on April 30 to examine Blair.

"I was asked to examine in particular parts of his hands," he told the court.

Dr Anderson said Blair had three superficial lacerations on his right hand and said he was questioned by police if the injuries could have been caused by grasping timber.

Defence lawyer Catherine Morgan asked Dr Anderson if he had noticed splinters or fragments in Blair's hands, to which he answered no.

The court heard from forensic scientist Angela Adamson from Queensland Health, who testified via telephone, that Blair's DNA was found on swabs taken from the shoes and socks, timber and other items collected by police.

Warwick "Rick" Hart, owner of Maryborough shop Rick's Pies, testified he knew Blair and saw him with friends on April 28 after midnight in the shop.

He told the court he couldn't see any trouble at the time.

The trial continues on Tuesday.
