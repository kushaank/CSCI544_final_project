
A 24-year-old Laie man is being held on suspicion of drunk driving after a fatal accident with a skateboarder in Kaaawa.

According to Honolulu police, Hienie Davis was the driver of a car that hit and killed Bernardo Bernard of Honolulu on Kamehameha Highway, a little more than 60 feet south of the intersection with Keo Place. The incident occurred at 12:40 a.m.

Dozens of Bernard's friends and family, many of them shocked and distraught, came and brought flowers to the scene. A concrete highway barrier across from Keo's place has been turned into a makeshift memorial, with friends leaving handwritten tributes.

Investigators said the 26-year-old Bernard was riding a skateboard Kahuku-bound when it rode into the path of the car driven by Davis, which was also heading toward Kahuku.

Bernard was pronounced dead at the scene. Davis was not hurt. Police said speed was not a factor in the collision.

Police arrested Davis on suspicion of driving under the influence and first-degree negligent homicide. However, investigators also said that Bernard also had been drinking.

"Possibly drinking on both parts, and being in the wrong place at the wrong time when they collided," said Theresa Paulette of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. "But definitely alcohol is the problem."

Paulette's 15-year-old son was killed in 1992 by a driver who had six prior DUI arrests. "Any time there's a drunk driving crash, it saddens MADD. We work very hard to educate -- we know the devastation of the family now that has lost a young man."

Bernard's death is Oahu's 25th traffic fatality of the year so far, compared to 27 a year ago.
