Police have a female suspect in custody in connection with a stabbing incident that occurred in the Parkdale area of the city on May 13, according to Helena-West Helena Police reports.

According to Officer Sean Shelton’s narrative, Detective Lt. John Bailey and he were the first officers on the scene but were unable to locate the victim. A trail of blood was discovered leading down Parkdale toward Park Street. Shelton asked Officer Chris Miller to check out the Parkdale residence.

The report said Shelton was later dispatched to a Dinan Street address where the stabbing victim had been located. Shelton said the victim, identified as James Suggs, had been stabbed and cut with a knife.

In his description of the wounds, Shelton commented that Suggs also had suffered a 7-inch laceration on the right side of his chest in a “downward-type” angle and a puncture wound to his left cheek that went through to the inside of his mouth.

A 911 caller indentified the alleged attacker and also reported that Suggs had managed to walk from his home on Parkdale to his relatives’ home on Dinan, the report stated.

The suspect was taken into custody and transported to police headquarters to be processed. The report did not indicate what charges would be filed against the alleged attacker.

Pafford Ambulance Service transported Suggs to Helena Regional Medical Center for emergency treatment. The report says that as of May 14, Suggs was waiting to be transported to another hospital for the treatment of his injuries.

Capt. Carl Vann of H-WHPD’s Criminal Investigation Division took photos of Suggs’ injuries.
