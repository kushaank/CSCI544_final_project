
MANILA, Philippines - Maritime Industry Authority (Marina) administrator Maximo Mejica Jr., deputy administrator for operations Gloria Banas and eight other officials of the agency are facing graft and other criminal and administrative charges before the Office of the Ombudsman.

The complaints stem from the allegedly questionable grant of a P59-million government contract to APO Production Co. headed by Jaime Aldaba for the printing, supply and delivery of Seafarers Identification and Record Book (SIRB) or Seaman’s Book in 2014.

Engineer Nelson Ramirez, president of the group United Filipino Seafarers (UFS), filed the cases, asking for an investigation, preventive suspension, and eventually the indictment of the respondents before the proper court.

“It likewise deprived Marina of revenue that could have otherwise accrued to the National Treasury out of the fees paid by seafarers for processing the Seaman’s Book,” he added.

He further alleged that the award of the contract to APO despite its supposed lack of capability to undertake the project gave the firm unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference.
