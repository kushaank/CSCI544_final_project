
Rick Sant, vice president of operations, The Orange County Register, Santa Ana, Calif.

Getting into commercial printing 10 years ago and changing the mindset of the people around here. We had to make them believe it would work and that we would get the business. We had to try. If we didn’t, that was worse than failing, so we might as well try. Today, we’re super-confident with the jobs and the employees are constantly asking for more printing jobs.

For us, we’ll be seeing more consolidation in the region. Overall in the industry, we have too much iron in the market. We have too many printers printing for free…there’s a lot of overhead, but not a lot of money.

Digital printing is very big, but personally, we won’t make money out of it. It’s just not for us.
