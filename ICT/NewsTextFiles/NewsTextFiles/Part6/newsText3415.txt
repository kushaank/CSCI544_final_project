GHAZIABAD: Around 700  explosive sticks were discovered in the junkyard of a  scrap dealer in Loni area of Ghaziabad after a blast there injured two children.

Police made the discovery on Saturday night. Ghaziabad SSP Sachi Ghildiyal said it had not yet been ascertained whether the explosives had detonators. Police are investigating how the explosives travelled to Ghaziabad and whether these were meant to be used for mining blasts or for more sinister purposes. The scrap-dealer, Ram Prakash, is being questioned about the source of the explosives. Another scrap-dealer, Kale, from Nangloi has been detained.

Ghaziabad SP  Jagdish Sharma said, "Prakash usually extracts copper metal from the junk that he gets. Yesterday his sons also accompanied him. As soon as they stuck the hammer in the scrap, there was a loud  explosion that injured the children. The locals then made a PCR call and they were taken to the hospital."

Ram Prakash's sons Rinku (13) and Shivam (10) were critically injured and are in hospital. "We have already flagged the state and central security agencies. These agencies are also working on the case. Prima facie it appears that the detonator like article was used for stone crushing purpose and would have travelled from a place where such explosives are used for stone crushing," Ghildiyal said.
