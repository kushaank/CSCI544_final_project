REGINA -- Police are investigating a fatal collision involving a pedestrian on Highway 11 Sunday night.

According to information from the RCMP, a 19-year-old Regina woman was struck by a vehicle just east of the weigh scales between Regina and Lumsden.

After police from the White Butte detachment were dispatched at 9:37 p.m., they learned a southbound vehicle had struck and killed the woman who witnesses said had been walking in the middle of the highway.

Police have not released the womanâs name at the request of her family. Police said the vehicle and driver involved remained at the scene after the collision.

The subsequent police investigation involved a traffic reconstructionist being called to attend and led to the temporary closure of one of the southbound lanes.

The highway was fully reopened when that portion of the investigation concluded at about 3:15 a.m. Monday.

The investigation, which also involves the Office of the Chief Coroner, is continuing. An autopsy had been ordered and will be performed sometime this week.
