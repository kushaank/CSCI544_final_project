
At least thirty-two people, mostly children, have been killed after the bus they were traveling burst into flames in northern Colombia, media reports citing officials said Monday.

Those on board the ill-fated bus were reportedly returning from an event at an evangelical Christian church near the northern city of Fundacion when the mishap happened.

The driver of the bus was among the nineteen people who managed to escape the blaze.

Local media quoted survivors as saying that the mishap happened as the driver was attempting to start the faulty bus by pouring fuel from a canister into the engine.

Police have launched an investigation into the incident and taken the bus driver into custody.
