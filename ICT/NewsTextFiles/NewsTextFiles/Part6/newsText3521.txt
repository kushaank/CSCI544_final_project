POLICE Legacy helps families of serving and former police officers who are going through hard times.

This can be as result of the officer being killed on duty, falling ill as a result of the job or not being able to work due to injury.

The charity presently supports 362 widows, three widowers and 48 children under the age of 18.

In supporting these families the money raised reaches further then the police family, touching the communities they live in as well.

Local Sergeant Duncan Swadkins said during his time as a police officer, he had known others who had been killed while on duty and others who had been seriously injured.

"In Nannup on June 1940, Constable Laurence Buzza was shot and killed by a prisoner while on only his second day in Nannup," he said.

"With this in mind, I would like to thank the Nannup Bakery for their support.

"Dave Shipton, the bakery owner and his team recently donated $120 for the Police Legacy.

"The money was raised through his Cops Special doughnuts and coffee offer where members of public donated money into the tin at the bakery and his staff placed any spare change in the tin."

Inspector Richard Moore of the South West Police District office recently attended the Nannup Bakery on behalf of Police Legacy and presented Mr Shipton and his team with a plaque and a certificate of appreciation.

"I understand Dave is still running the special and although James and myself at the police station are doing our best to contribute to the offer on doughnuts any assistance would be appreciated," Sgt Swadkins said.

"If you wish any further information on Police Legacy please come and see us at the Nannup Police Station."
