
Paris police arrested a drunk man early Saturday after he began mounting the capital's famous Iron Lady. He reportedly made it around 30 metres up one of the Eiffel Tower's pillars before officers talked him down and hauled him off to jail.

Police in the posh 7th arrondissement got a call around 3:15am alerting them to the fact a man was attempting to scale the legendary Iron Lady. Sure enough, once on scene the officers spotted the man about 30 metres above the Champ de Mars park, AFP reported.

After his little adventure the impromptu climber was arrested, charged and has been ordered to appear before court, sources told French media.

This wouldn't be the first strange, funny or dangerous incident in the 125 years the tower has stood in Paris. Last year an artist was arrested for dancing with a rooster tied to his penis underneath the tower  and The Local reported how a French Foreign  Legionnaire was arrested for flying an unauthorized drone at the tourist site, earlier this year.
