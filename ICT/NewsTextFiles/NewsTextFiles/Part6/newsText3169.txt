
The 321 North project in Plantation, at the former Fashion Mall, is tied up in litigation between its manager and its majority owner.

The shuttered mall exited Chapter 11 in 2012 with plans for a 660,000-square-foot mixed-use development. The first phase would be a renovated office building.

Tangshan Ganglu Iron & Steel Co., a Chinese company with an 80 percent ownership interest in the property, filed a complaint on May 7 in federal court in Fort Lauderdale against Chen, a Chinese citizen who resides in Aventura. He owns the other 20 percent of Mapuche LLC, which controls U.S. Capital Holdings, the owner of the mall at 321 N. University Drive.

Fort Lauderdale attorney Benjamin E. Olive , who represents Chen in the lawsuit, couldnâ€™t be reached for comment. In a response to the complaint, Olive said the court lacks jurisdiction to hear the case because both parties are citizens of China.

Gangluâ€™s complaint said Chen misappropriated $48.7 million of the $50 million that the company loaned to Mapuche in 2012 to develop the project.

The plaintiff asked the court to appoint Jianan Du as custodian of the property. The motion will be heard on Thursday before U.S. District Judge James I. Cohen .
