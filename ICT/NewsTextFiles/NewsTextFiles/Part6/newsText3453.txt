
LONGVIEW, TX (KLTV) - On Monday, Longview Police Department welcomed their first female police lieutenant.

Sergeant Laura Samples will serve as the first female lieutenant in the history of the department. Samples was promoted to the position in a ceremony held Monday morning at the Gregg County Courthouse.

Samples began working for the City of Longview in June 2010 in the Environmental Health Department. She joined the police department in November 2001.

Samples was promoted to the rank of sergeant in January 2007. She has served as field supervisor on all three patrol shifts, for three years in the Office of Professional Standards and was then selected to serve as the supervisor over planning, research and crime analysis.

“Although I have enjoyed all of the assignments I have held, it was the time I spent in Internal Affairs that had the greatest impact. With Chief Dingler as my mentor, I learned to see the big picture and start thinking like an administrator. I can never thank him enough for the support and encouragement he has given me," said Samples. "I am proud to serve as the first female Lieutenant for the Longview Police Department and hope that this promotion will encourage other women to do the same.”During her time with the department, Samples has served as a patrol officer, bicycle officer and field training officer. She has also served on the Academy Advisory Board, Awards Board and Applicant Interview Board.

Before she began working for the City of Longview, Samples served in the U.S. Army as a military police officer during both Desert Shield and Desert Storm. She graduated from the Denver Paralegal Institute and has an Associate's Degree from Kilgore College and a Bachelor's Degree in Criminal Justice from Fort Hays State University. She is nearing the completion of her Master's Degree in Human Resource Management.
