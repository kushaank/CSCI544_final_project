
JANESVILLE | An on-duty Black Hawk County Sheriff’s deputy was one of two people injured in a crash Sunday night.

The Iowa State Patrol is still investigating the crash that happened on southbound U.S. Highway 218 near County Road C-57 around 6:25 p.m. Troopers say Chad Chase, 43, of Waterloo, pulled away from a stop sign and into the path of Melissa Kramer, 44, of Waverly. Kramer lost control of her vehicle and drove it into a ditch.

Kramer was injured in the crash and was taken to Covenant Medical Center in Waterloo. Chase is also listed as injured in the crash but was not transported to the hospital. A Courier article from 2008 lists Chase as a Black Hawk County sheriff’s deputy. The Sheriff’s Office also confirms the deputy suffered only minor injuries in the crash.

Sheriff's officials said Chase was in a marked county squad Tahoe on his way to a call when the crash occurred. He did not have his lights and siren activated.
