
A day after two children were injured in a powerful blast in a Ghaziabad scrap godown, police today recovered 700 detonators from the custody of a scrap dealer, who stored them illegally.

Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) also interrogated Ram Prakash, a resident of Prem Nagar area of Ghaziabab, to ascertain if detonators were to be used for any explosion.

Prakash, however, told police that he bought electric scrap from Mundka area of the national capital three days back.

"Police have detained Ram Prakash and took him to Mundka area from where he bought electric scrap. UP ATS has also interrogated him. Police are investigating if seized detonators were to be used for any explosion," said a senior police officer.

The officer also said that Ram Prakash, who has been dealing in electric scrap for several years, has to go through a series of interrogations.

"We have sent seized detonators to Forensic Science Laboratory in Agra and police would also interrogate those from whom Ram Prakash bought electric scrap in Mundka area of Delhi," he added.

Yesterday, two children had been injured in a powerful blast in a scrap godown in the Prem Nagar area of Ghaziabad.

In this incident, Rinku, the son of Ram Prakash, was seriously injured when he was burning some wires in his father's scrap godown.

The blast was so powerful that it shook the walls of nearby houses. The reason for the blast is not known.
