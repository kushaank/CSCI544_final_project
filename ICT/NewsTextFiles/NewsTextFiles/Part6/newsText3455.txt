
LORAIN � Police are warning residents of a Publisher�s Clearing House phone scam that cost a Lorain man $1,250.

According to Sgt. Michael Failing, the 74-year-old man received a phone call about 9:30 a.m. May 15 from a man who identified himself as James Washington.

�Washington� told the man he had been the lucky winner of the contest, and to offset the taxes associated with the winnings, he needed to send a pair of money orders totaling $1,250.

The victim sent the money orders May 15, and a day later was contacted again by a man who stated he was Jim Carter and the head of Publisher�s Clearing House. The man on the phone claimed the victim would receive a check for $12 million, $250,000 in cash and two vehicles, but would need to send another money order totaling $1,500 to a Texas address, according to Failing.

Police are advising residents to be wary of phone calls from either 1-876-462-1209, or 1-876-464-3332.
