
The Louisiana State Police has arrested Shedrick D. Butler, 30, Melpomene Dr., Baker, and charged him with 3rd Offense DWI.

According to an affidavit, a Trooper witnessed Butlerâ€™s Toyota Camry strike a curb while exiting the interstate at Harding Blvd. sometime Sunday.

The Trooper stopped the vehicle and made contact with Butler, who is described in the report as having red, bloodshot eyes and a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on his breath. Butler admitted to the Trooper that he had a few beers to drink in Plaquemine, where he was coming from.

Butler was given an SFST which he performed poorly on. He was placed under arrest and transported to Baton Rouge Police 1st District, where he refused a chemical breath test. Butler also refused to answer any interview questions asked by the Trooper.

Butler was charged with 3rd Offense DWI and Careless Operation. He was transported to EBR Parish Prison where he was later released after posting a $22,500 bond.
