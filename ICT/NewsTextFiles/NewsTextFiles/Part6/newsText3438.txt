The New Hampshire police commissioner who called President Obama the n-word has resigned his post.

Robert Copeland, 82, issued a resignation letter as head of the Wolfeboro police commission to Town Manager David Owen.

A local resident complained to Owen after hearing Copeland use the slur to describe Obama while sitting in a local restaurant. Copeland subsequently added to the controversy by refusing to apologize.

"I believe I did use the 'n' word in reference to the current occupant of the White House," Copeland wrote to his fellow commissioners last week. "For this, I do not apologize â€” he meets and exceeds my criteria for such."

Copeland drew fire from Sens. Kelly Ayotte (R) and Jeanne Shaheen (D) and Gov. Maggie Hassan -- and even Mitt Romney, who owns a vacation home there.

Local officials were quick to condemn Copeland. Owen issued a statement last week saying he and the town's board of selectman found Copeland's behavior "reprehensible and totally inconsistent with the Town's open and welcoming character. Mr. Copeland's views are in no way representative of the Board of Selectmen of the Town of Wolfeboro, its administration, or the men and women of the Wolfeboro Police Department "

The controversy rattled the quaint tourist town of 6,300 people on the shores of Lake Winnipesaukee. Last week, more than 100 people attended a public hearing, most demanding that Copeland resign. There is no statute allowing for a recall election, and Copeland was elected to a second three-year term in March.

Linda Murray, chairman of the town board, told the Associated Press the resignation "gives us the opportunity to move on. We are a very accepting community that really takes care of each other."
