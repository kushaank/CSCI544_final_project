
The victim, 32, told police that as he was driving north on Ebenezer Road, a man in a white truck pulled up behind him, flashing his lights and blowing his horn, according to a Rock Hill police report. Once the cars reached the stoplight at Celanese Road, the alleged combative driver began yelling at him and they exchanged words.

The driver, the victim told police, then pulled a gun out of his glove box and made the statement: Is this what you want? The suspect pulled his car forward, allowing the victim to write down his license plate number. As the victim made a left onto Celanese Road, the suspect followed him into several parking lots before stopping, getting out of his car and waving at the victim to come over to where he was standing.

Police went to a home on Featherstone Court, the registered address for the car, and spoke with Brian Brown, 31, who matched the description the victim gave police. Brown told police the victim pulled out in front of him and then pulled into the Ebenezer Animal Hospital. The victim, Brown claimed, pulled up to him at the stoplight and began an argument.

Brown admitted that he had a .45 caliber handgun, which also matched the description the victim gave officers. Police confiscated the gun, which had 10 bullets in the magazine but no ammunition in the chamber. Brown told police he did pull the handgun out, but did not point it at the victim. He only wanted to show him that he did not want any trouble. Police arrested Brown, charging him with pointing and presenting a firearm.
