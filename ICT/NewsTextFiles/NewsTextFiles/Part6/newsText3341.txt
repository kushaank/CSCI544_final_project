A 22-year-old man and woman, both from Greenwood, were charged with theft over the weekend, Harrington police said Monday.

A resident of the 100 Block of East Milby St., Harrington called police after discovering money was stolen. During their investigation, officers learned Joshua Breeding and Kerri A. Boone had been at the victim's home, as well as in the victim's vehicle, from where the money was stolen.

Breeding and Boone were charged with theft under $1,500 and third-degree conspiracy. Breeding was taken into custody in Seaford by Delaware State Police and turned over to the Harrington police. Boone surrendered to Harrington police.

Both were arraigned via video phone at Justice of the Peace Court 7 in Dover and released on $1,000 unsecured bond pending a future court appearance.
