Central High School English teacher Lee Anne Shoeman, 56, didn't show up for work on Monday morning. That's when colleagues got worried.

Deputies went to check on Shoeman at her home along Meredith Drive, and found her dead inside.

Shoeman taught juniors and senior and ran the honor society.

"I don't think she deserved what happened -- my friends and I have the greatest respect for her," said one student.

The principal held a faculty meeting after school. Students and parents received a statement saying psychologists, social workers and guidance counselors will be on campus Tuesday.

Investigators think she was targeted and don't think any students or other teachers are in danger.
