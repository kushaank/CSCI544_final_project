
A man threatened to blow up Love's Truck Stop and travel center Sunday evening, earning him a trip to jail.

At around 6:50 p.m., police went to Love’s, 3211 S. Newberry, to check out a report that a man was claiming he was “going to blow the place up," police spokesman Rodney Brown said.

Officers arrested Tzakis and charged him with making terroristic threats. Tzakis climbed inside his vehicle to get his ID, but then refused to get out and "became non-compliant," Brown said.

Eventually police got him out of the vehicle, and after a brief struggle, handcuffed him and took him to the Lincoln County jail. For his trouble, he was also charged with felony assault on a police officer, third-degree assault and resisting arrest.

Bond is set at $10,000, according to sheriff's records.
