Malaysia's Defence Minister says his country's military did not check an unidentified plane on its radar around the time of flight MH370's disappearance, because it was not deemed to be a threat.

The revelations, broadcast last night on Australian current affairs television programme Four Corners, raise questions about whether the military's inaction may have allowed the Malaysia Airlines flight to disappear on March 8.

Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told Four Corners Malaysia's Civil Aviation Authority asked the military to keep an eye on a plane which appeared on their radar. However, they decided it was not hostile and did not pursue it further.

"It was commercial, it was in our air space, we were not at war with anybody,'' Mr Hussein said.

Malaysia's opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim said the military had completely breached its standard operating procedures, causing "a major threat to national security".

Former pilots told the programme they believe MH370 could only have lost its transponder and other communication systems through human interference.

If communications had been cut due to a fire, the plane could not have continued flying for several hours more as satellites detected it did, they said.

The programme also spoke to the brother-in-law of Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, who denied the pilot was a political radical who had cheated on his wife.

The search for MH370 continues in the Indian Ocean, two-and-a-half months after the plane disappeared with 239 people on board.

A Chinese navy survey ship will begin mapping the ocean floor off the west Australian coast this week.
