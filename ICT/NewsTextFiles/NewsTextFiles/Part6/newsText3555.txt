LEWISTON, Idaho -- Two people suspected of robbing a western Idaho bank have been arrested in Lewiston after Idaho County officials received an anonymous tip about someone matching the description of the robber spending a lot of cash at a casino.

The Lewiston Tribune reports officers arrested 35-year-old Rocky Fisher of Nampa and 19-year-old Jennifer Balfe of Meridian at 11 a.m. Sunday as they walked out of a motel room in Lewiston.

Cottonwood Police Chief Terry Cochran says they were both booked into jail Sunday evening on suspicion of robbery, burglary and grand theft for Friday's robbery in Cottonwood.

Lewiston police say officials are investigating whether Fisher and Balfe may also be responsible for bank robberies that took place on May 9 and May 14 in Ontario, Oregon. No one has been charged in those robberies.
