
Following approval from the Montgomery County Salary Board, Sheriff Russell Bono announced May 15 he was appointing former Norristown police Chief Willie Richet to be his chief deputy at a press conference outside of the courthouse.

The salary board approved Richet for a salary of $67,205 at its meeting following the commissioners meeting May 16.

County Commissioner Bruce L. Castor Jr. said he was excited to have Richet coming back to work in law enforcement after the salary board approved his hiring.

Bono and Richet began working together as patrol officers in the 1970s in the Norristown Police Department. Since then they have “moved up the ranks” together, according to Bono. When Bono was asked to be the Norristown Police Department’s police chief in 1998, he asked Richet to be his chief deputy.

A previous report stated that Bono and Richet have worked together since Richet joined the Norristown police department in 1973.

Richet is the first African-American chief deputy in the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Department.

“Russell picked not only a man of integrity, a man of strength, but a good friend for many years,” state Rep. Mike Vereb, R-150, said at the press conference.

The position of chief deputy to the sheriff became available when former Chief Deputy Alfred Ricci retired in January shortly after former Sheriff Eileen Behr announced she would be resigning in December. Before Bono was nominated to be sheriff, Capt. Gregory Womelsdorf held both positions as acting sheriff and acting chief deputy until Richet’s appointment.
