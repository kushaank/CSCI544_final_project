
China continued the evacuation of its citizens from Vietnam on Monday following last week's riots. Some 3,500 Chinese nationals were heading home on ships deployed from Hainan.

"The cross-department working group set up by the Chinese government has been contacting China's Embassy in Vietnam to arrange the evacuation of Chinese workers. Some Chinese nationals have fled to Cambodia. The Chinese government thanks Cambodia for its the assistance it has given to those who fleeing danger. Chinaâ€™s Embassy in Cambodia has also provided necessary assistance," Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said.

The Foreign Ministry spokesman said that China has raised the level of security warning for Chinese tourists in Vietnam, and told its citizens not to travel to the country.

Four Chinese ships are evacuating Chinese nationals. Each ship is able to carry about 1,000 passengers. The first vessel, Wu Zhishan, left Vung Ang port with 989 evacuees and is expected to arrive in Haikou, South China, on Tuesday morning. Some injured Chinese workers have already been flown home on two chartered flights.
