
Students at a Chilean University have had their student loan records destroyed    by a radical artist protesting the cost of higher education in the South    American country.

Activist Francisco Tapia, also known as 'Papas Fritas', reportedly seized the    records of the college's $500m student loan book during an occupation of the    Universidad del Mar in the south western city of Viña del Mar.

A video in which Mr Tapia admits responsibility for the burning has gone    viral, attracting over 70,000 views since it was published.

He appears in front of a potted plant, sporting a beard reminiscent of Fidel    Castro's, along with a black cardigan and a yellow woolen hat to admit his    act of sabotage.

He said: "It’s over, it’s finished. You don’t have to pay another peso.    We have to lose our fear, our fear of being thought of as criminals because    we’re poor. I am just like you, and I live it [life] day by day - this is my    act of love for you."

Police seized the charred remains of the loan papers - known locally as    'pagarés' - from a nearby cultural centre where they were being exhibited    shortly after the video emerged.

The University could now be forced to individually sue its students to recoup    the loans.

Chile has been gripped by angry protests in recent years as students have    taken to the streets to demand free higher education.
