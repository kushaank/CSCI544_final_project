
HYDERABAD: After a bomb threat call, police conducted a thorough anti-sabotage sweep at the Secunderabad railway station on Monday. Later, they realized it was a hoax call.

At 2.30pm, the main police control room received an anonymous phone call saying a bomb was planted on the Secunderabad railway station premises and it could go off at any moment.

The control room staff immediately alerted the Secunderabad railway police and security wing officers screened the entire station. "We have not found any explosive materials and now we are on the job of zeroing in on the caller. Train traffic was not affected due to the checking," Secunderabad GRP inspector Ch Anjaneyulu said.
