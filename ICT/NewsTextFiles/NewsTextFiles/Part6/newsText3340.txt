Monday, officers with local police agencies will carry the Special Olympics torch through Northwest Arkansas.

In Springdale, one group of police officers will begin at the western city limits on Sunday, the other will begin at the northern city limits on Thompson. They will meet up at Thompson and Sunset where they will continue south on Highway-71, where they will turn the torch over to officers with the Fayetteville Police Department.

After passing through Northwest Arkansas, the torch will eventually be run all the way to Searcy, Arkansas, for the Special Olympics Summer Games.
