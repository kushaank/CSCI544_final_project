
VietNamNet Bridge – China still maintained over 90 vessels of various kinds around its oil rig Haiyang Shiyou – 981 which is illegally standing in Vietnam’s continental shelf and exclusive economic zone, reported the Vietnam Coast Guard on May 19.

The Chinese coast guard 2506 kept following the Vietnam coast guard ship 8001 in a distance of 1-2 nautical miles.

Meanwhile, a fleet of Chinese fishing boats approached and intimidated wooden boats of Vietnamese fishermen.

At 9:06 a.m, a Chinese fighter jet JH-7 was discovered to be flying over Vietnamese coast guard ships at the height of 700 – 1,000m. It made four turns before heading to the north.

Later at 11:30am, a Chinese helicopter B-3808 was seen prowling around the Vietnam coast guard ship 8003 at the height of 250m.

While undertaking a communication mission at a distance of 6-6.5 nautical miles from the oil rig, Vietnamese coast guard ships were intercepted by three Chinese ships, which also fired water cannons at them.

The Vietnam Coast Guard ship 8003 was approached by other six Chinese vessels, which displayed a ready-to-attack move.

On May 2, China stationed Haiyang Shiyou – 981 at 15 degrees 29 minutes 58 seconds north latitude and 111 degrees 12 minutes 06 seconds east longitude. The location is 80 nautical miles inside Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone.

China has deployed vessels of various kinds to the area, including military, coast guard, marine surveillance, marine patrol and fishing ships.

The provocative acts by China, including the ramming and firing of water cannons into Vietnamese coast guard ships during their law enforcement missions in the country’s waters, have left many Vietnamese ships damaged and fisheries surveillance officers injured.
