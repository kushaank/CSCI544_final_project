TOKYO--A record surge in Japan's machinery orders in March to a six-year high suggests Japanese business investment may remain solid even after a sales tax increase seen as a major test for the pro-growth policies of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

While the higher-than-expected expansion in orders came largely from one-off demand from the manufacturing sector, economists say the outcome bodes well for the economy after the April tax increase and may also limit an expected downward revision of gross domestic product data.

Core machinery orders shot up 19.1% in March from a month ago, the sharpest jump on record, to Yen936.7 billion ($9.23 billion), the Cabinet Office said Monday. The order volume was the highest since June 2008, before the outbreak of the global financial crisis. The core data excludes shipping and power company orders due to their large size and volatility.

Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected the orders to increase by 6.2%.

The government said the main contributing factors were large one-off orders in the transport, aircraft and computer industries.

Though the outcome must be discounted to some extent due to the large swings recently seen in the often-volatile data, economists say the latest figures give them more confidence about the outlook for the Japanese economy. They are focusing on how the economy will fare after April's tax increase amid concern that a drop in consumption as a result of the higher tax might derail the efforts of the Abe administration to kick start growth with its growth policies known as Abenomics.

The sales tax rate went up to 8% from 5% on April 1.

Machinery orders are known as a leading indicator suggesting the likely trend of capital expenditure six months down the line. Yuki Endo, an economist at Hamagin Research Institute, said the stronger-then-expected machinery orders outcome shows sentiment at companies is likely to remain strong even after the tax increase.

"Business investment should keep expanding at a moderate pace at least, on the back of good corporate earnings and the need to replace old machinery," said Mr. Endo, who expects Japan's economy to snap back to a growth path after a short contraction in the April-June quarter.

The data showed that core orders rose 4.2% during the January-March quarter from the previous three-month period. The data also indicated that the April-June quarter is expected to log a 0.4% gain.

The quarterly figure may limit an expected revision of the nation's GDP data for the January-March period. Many economists expect a downward revision to the data due to technical factors. But the adjustment may turn out to be smaller than initially thought because of the strong machinery orders data, Takashi Shiono, an economist at Credit Suisse said.

Preliminary figures released last week showed real GDP expanding an annualized 5.9% in the first quarter.

Mr. Shiono said that judging from Monday's data, the revised GDP figure due on June 9 "could stay above 5%."

Despite economists' relatively optimistic take on the machinery orders data, risks remain for Japan's recovery in the coming months, with a possible slump in domestic spending after the tax increase looming large among them as well as the negative impact of sluggish overseas economies, especially in Asia.

The Chinese economy is set to slow down due to a weakening in investment, said Mizuho Research Institute's economist on Asia Takayuki Miyajima. Another downside risk for China is the possibility of its property market worsening further, he added.

In addition to China, the Asean economies "are becoming increasingly worrisome due to political developments in Thailand and Vietnam," he said.
