
CHILDREN as young as 12 are behind a spate of brazen raids on motor dealerships which have netted cars worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, say police.

In one incident, a new $70,000 V8 Holden Maloo utility was driven out a display window from a dealership.

On Sunday, three new Subaru Foresters worth about $105,000 were stolen from a card yard in Cairns.

A Ford Ranger and a Holden Commodore were also snatched in raids on four separate businesses in a two-day crime spree.

Four teenagers — and one child aged 12 — have been arrested by Cairns Property Crime Squad detectives and hit with 54 charges.

A Holden HSV GTS Maloo ute similar to this one was driven through a  glass window from one dealership.

In a disturbing trend, police are concerned about the deadly threat posed to other motorists and pedestrians by unlicensed children driving stolen motor cars.

In just five months, Cairns Property Crime Squad has arrested 300 people on a total of 1088 charges and recovered about $500,000 worth of stolen property.

More than half of the 300 arrested were juveniles.

Car dealerships in the city have moved to hire 24-hour full time private security guards, installing razor wire fencing and more CCTV cameras to deter the spate of thefts.
