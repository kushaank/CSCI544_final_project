
A 29-year-old man told police a man he knew robbed him at gunpoint Saturday in the parking lot of Capital Teletrack, 1766 Wabash Ave.

Springfield police said Sunday that they were still investigating the incident and had identified a suspect. Nobody had been arrested.

The alleged armed robbery occurred at 7 p.m. Saturday. The man said he returned to his car when the robber, who he described to police as an acquaintance, approached him.

The man said the robber threatened him with a gun and stole more than $500. Officers spotted the possible armed robber driving away quickly from the parking lot but chose not to pursue, Springfield police Lt. Dyle Stokes said.

Stokes said the vehicle was later found at an unrelated address.
