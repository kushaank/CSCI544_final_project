
TUCSON (KGUN9--TV)--  More than one-thousand dog deaths may have been caused by toxic jerky treats. The Food and Drug Administration says there have been almost 5,000 complaints since 2007 about the treats. Most of those symptoms include liver or urinary disease. The FDA is still unsure about the specific cause of the illnesses and deaths, but most cases happened right after the pets had eaten chicken, duck or sweet potato treats imported from China.

This time around the FDA didn't mention any specific brands in their release. Pet owner's best bet is to check the labels, but even a "made in the USA" stamp isn't a safe bet. The FDA says the product could still contain  ingredients from China or other countries.
