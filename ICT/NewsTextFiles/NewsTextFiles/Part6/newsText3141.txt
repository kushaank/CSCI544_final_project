According to his words, to join or not to join the union - this is a sovereign decision of Kyrgyzstan. "We have been negotiating with the Chinese side, and it has a positive attitude to this issue. If all decisions taken by the government, will benefit the country, then of course they would support. They are ready to continue to strengthen cooperation with us. I do not think that our entry into the Customs Union will harm the Kyrgyz- Chinese relations," said Abdyldaev.
