
DALLAS -- Police have arrested a woman after they say she tried to run over several people, including two children, before driving into a home in Southeast Dallas.

According to an arrest affidavit, around 11:30 a.m. on May 18, officers were called to a disturbance call in the 4000 block of Sonny Circle near Spring Avenue and Lagow Street.

Police say Gabrielle Regina Jackson, 24, told a witness that she was heading to the first victim's house. The witness, who was in the area, says he tried to stop Jackson, but she drove around him and kept going.

Around that time, the victim was pulling up to her house and recognized Jackson's vehicle. She pulled over to the right side of the road. The affidavit says Jackson then "swerved left intentionally colliding with [her] vehicle."

Police say Jackson then swerved to hit an 11-year-old who was walking down the street, injuring the child and damaging a fence. She then chased a 6-year-old pedestrian up to a porch and tried to hit the child and another adult witness by driving her car into the home.

Jackson then backed up her vehicle and was in the passenger seat when police arrived.

Everyone was treated at the scene and Jackson was arrested, the affidavit said.

While being interviewed at the police station, Jackson reportedly told officers, "She better watch her kids. I've got money. When I get out, I will buy a gun and shoot up that house. Now I know where she lives."

Jackson has been charged with four counts of aggravated assault with a vehicle. She is currently in the Dallas County Jail.

Police have not said why Jackson was angry in the first place.
