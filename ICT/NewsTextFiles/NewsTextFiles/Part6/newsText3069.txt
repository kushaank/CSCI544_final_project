
RUSSIAN President Vladimir Putin is to fly to Shanghai tomorrow to bolster ties with China in light of worsening relations with the US and EU.

He told Chinese media in Moscow today that Russia sees links with China as a top priority and their bonds now are the best ever.

Mr Putin revealed that a deal on Russian natural gas exports to China is close to being signed, adding that it would allow Russia to diversify its export routes and let China meet its growing demand for energy.

“In the context of the turbulent global economy, the strengthening of mutually beneficial trade and economic ties, as well as the increase of investment flows between Russia and China, are of paramount importance,” Mr Putin said.

The two countries developed what they call a “strategic partnership” after the 1991 Soviet collapse.

Mr Putin said that Russia would welcome more Chinese investments, in particular in a free trade zone currently being established in the far eastern port of Vladivostok.
