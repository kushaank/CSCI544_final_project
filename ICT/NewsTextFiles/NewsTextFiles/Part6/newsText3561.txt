This is the perfect example of the need for something like a 3 strikes law. This guy should be put away forever. Obviously he can't live any other way than by being a criminal.

There is a typographical error near the end of the story. I seriously doubt that the Red Bank Police Chief has convictions dating back to 2007. I think the sentence should read: "Vaughan has convictions dating back to 2007."

Good Lord... one of the dumbest things I've ever read.  I guess that sentence would have garnered me some kind of punishment at that dump of a school, lol.  Is there ever any good news out of our educational system anymore?  Wow.

We feel like peaches was stolen from our fenced-in yard during the night. She was last seen Thursday night 8/14/2014 around 11pm.If you have seen Peaches, please notify me 423-314-1398. My grand daughters have had this pet since she was born. NO QUESTIONS ASKED!

So sorry my last post posted 3 times but update on my little Katie bug, she can't eat crunchy foods because of her jaw broken but she is eating mushy food by hand  and when we go visit with her she wags her tail when she see us so that makes me very very happy. Still can't bring her home yet. :-( but very excited when we get to.

Thank you for your concerns immickslady, I really appreciate people like yourself. Katie living has been a miracle from God, I give God all the credit.
