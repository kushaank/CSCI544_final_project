
You can ignore the approaching horde for only so long – listings for The Walking Dead Game of the Year Edition on PS4 and Xbox One have popped up at online retailers over the past month or so, and recently the listings hit Amazon UK . This puts next-gen The Walking Dead Game of the Year Edition listings at GameFly , GameStop and Amazon.

According to the Amazon description, the bundle includes the complete first season of Telltale's The Walking Dead, plus the 400 Days DLC and a download of the original soundtrack. GameStop lists it as $30, while Amazon UK puts it at £30. GameStop and GameFly note release dates of July 31, while Amazon has a release date of July 25. It's up for pre-order across the sites.

We've reached out to Telltale for comment.

The Walking Dead season one and 400 Days DLC both have big impacts on season two, which is currently in its third ( and perhaps best ) episode.

The Walking Dead is set in the world of Robert Kirkmanâ€™s award-winning comic book series. Lee Everett, a convicted criminal, has been given a chance for redemption in a world devastated by the undead. Players will experience events, meet people and visit locations that foreshadow the story of Deputy Sheriff Rick Grimes. The Walking Dead offers a tailored game experience â€“ player actions, choices and decisions affect how the story plays out across the entire series.
