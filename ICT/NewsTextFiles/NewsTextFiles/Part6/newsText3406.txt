Robbery shooting a 'horrible thing'

A man shot dead after reportedly trying to rob a security guard outside a Gold Coast tavern was carrying a replica gun, police have confirmed.

According to reports, the man was also a former colleague of the security guard who shot him dead.

A Border Security guard was dropping off cash to the Highland Park Tavern on Monday morning when he was attacked by the other man, who was wearing a motorcycle helmet and brandishing a replica 9mm handgun gun.

The pair struggled before the guard managed to shoot the alleged bandit, a 46-year-old Upper Coomera man who was reportedly a father of five.

Police will continue to investigate the incident on Tuesday, although charges are unlikely to be laid against the 47-year-old guard who police say did not know his attacker’s weapon wasn’t genuine.

Police confirmed the guard was licensed to carry a gun.

The guard returned to the scene later on Monday dressed in a blue forensic suit, as he tried to help police piece together what happened.

A car parked near the scene was later seized by police. Investigators are trying to determine if it was a planned getaway vehicle belonging to the 46-year-old.

“Obviously [the guard is] quite distressed by the whole situation,” Detective Superintendent Dave Hutchinson told reporters on Monday.

He said the guard was attacked moments after getting out of his vehicle.

“As a consequence of that struggle, the offender sustained a number of gunshot wounds,” Det Supt Hutchinson said.
