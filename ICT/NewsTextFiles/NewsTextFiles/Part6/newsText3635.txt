
Customs and excise officers at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport arrested 48 drug smugglers during surveillance operations conducted from January to May 12, a senior official has said.

The airport’s customs and excise office head, Okto Irianto, said 29 of the 48 people arrested were Indonesian nationals, while the remaining 19 suspects were from China, Hong Kong, Kenya, Malaysia, Nigeria, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand and Uganda.

He said the officers caught some of the traffickers red-handed as they attempted to smuggle drugs through the airport, using methods including hiding drugs in the sides of their suitcases, in their underwear, inside toys, as well as swallowing them. Some of the arrests were the result of follow-up investigations.

“They used various methods but officers managed to detect their attempts and foiled them,” said Okto on Sunday, as quoted by Antara news agency.

The officers confiscated a total of 31,950 grams of crystal methamphetamine, known locally as shabu-shabu, in 28 of the smuggling cases. They also seized 20 ‘happy five’ tablets in one case and 5,140 grams of ketamine in another.

“So, the total number of attempted drug smuggling cases foiled from January to May 12 was 30, with 37,090 grams of drugs in powder or crystal form and 20 pills as evidence,” Okto said, adding that the confiscated drugs were worth an estimated Rp 48 billion (US$4.22 million).

Meanwhile, Soekarno-Hatta police’s drug unit deputy director, Adj. Comr. Subekti, said the suspects would be charged under Law No.35/2009 on drugs, with a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and a Rp 10 billion fine.
