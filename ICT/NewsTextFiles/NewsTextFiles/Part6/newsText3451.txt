
An Oklahoma County Sheriff who pulled up to help what appeared to be a stranded motorist ended up stopping a burglary in progress.

On Saturday, the deputy was driving on I240 near Sunnylane Road when two cars were spotted on the side of the road. One of the car's hood was raised and the second car had its flashers on. The deputy pulled over to check on them and see if they needed help.

The first man, 38-year-old Robert Jeffries, talked with the deputy. The deputy said when he walked up, another man had walked out of sight and Jeffries had thrown several items to the ground. The deputy said Jeffries appeared nervous and said that he had stopped to help a stranded driver. Jeffries told deputies the driver left the scene to get a battery and Jeffries was watching the car while he was gone.

Jeffries said the second man, 25-year-old Kyle Hurley, was a friend who had stopped to help as well.

Other deputies arrived as backup and that's when they noticed one of the cars had a broken window and there were signs the car had been burglarized.

Deputies said they found a woman, 21-year-old Tracy Jo Smith, in the backseat of the other car. Smith said she was asleep and didn't know what was going on.

Deputies said they searched her purse and found a pipe, digital scales, and a small baggie with crystal meth inside. They said they also found burglary tools and another pipe in the area where Jeffries had tossed items when the first deputy arrive.

Jeffries, Hurley, and Smith were all arrested for second degree burglary, possession of burglary tools, possession of stolen property, possession of methamphetamine, possession of drug paraphernalia, maintaining a vehicle were drugs are kept, and destruction of private property. Smith also faces a charge of with possession of drugs without a valid prescription.

Deputies said they tracked down the car's owner who said she did not know the suspects. She said her car had broken down and she left it on the side of the interstate.
