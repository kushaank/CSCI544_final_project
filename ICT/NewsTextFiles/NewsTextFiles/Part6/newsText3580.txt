
ELBURN – A joint investigation by the Elburn Police Department and Virginia authorities resulted Friday in an Elburn man’s arrest, Elburn police announced Monday in a news release.

Peter J. LaSalle Jr., 44, of the 800 block of Morrill Lane, was taken into custody during a planned traffic stop in the 200 block of Conley Drive at about 6:40 a.m., police said.

Police Chief Steve Smith said two felony warrants issued for LaSalle carried charges of using electronic means for child sex crimes, and one felony warrant carried a charge of taking indecent liberties with a child.

The arrest was reportedly tied to an investigation by the Staunton Police Department in Virginia.  Smith said the parents of a juvenile victim in Staunton filed a report regarding an indecent solicitation of a child through electronic means.

“The police department in Virginia asked for our assistance,” Smith said.

He said Elburn doesn’t get many requests like this.

“When we do, obviously we assist in any way we can,” he said.

A search warrant was also executed on LaSalle’s home, police said. Members of the police department and Kane County Sheriff’s Office seized items of evidence listed in the search warrant, police said.

LaSalle was reportedly taken to the Kane County Adult Corrections Center to await a Saturday morning bond and extradition hearing.

Online records for the sheriff’s office did not list him in custody Monday.
