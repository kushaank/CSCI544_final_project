
PANCHKULA: A district court on Monday sentenced two men to four-year imprisonment in a four-year-old Pinjore  ashram dacoity case. The district and sessions judge,  Ravi Kumar Sondhi, handed over the sentence to Mahavir Singh, 37, a resident of Baddi and native of Pinjore, and Chaman alias Chamma, 39, a resident of Pinjore, under section 412 (dishonestly receiving property stolen in the commission of a dacoity) of the IPC.

In 2010, seven people were reportedly involved in a dacoity in an ashram in Marrianwala village, near Baddi. They had reportedly looted a gold chain, gold earrings, a mobile phone and cash.

On the complaint of Hukam Chand, an eyewitness, the police had arrested five people. Later, they were acquitted by a local district court. The police then arrested the other two from their houses in Pinjore in 2013.

The looted items were recovered from their possession.

On Saturday, they were held guilty under Section 412 of the IPC, but were acquitted of Section 395 of the IPC (Punishment for dacoity) as their faces could not be recognized. The faces of the accused were covered with mufflers, according to the  defence lawyer Amardeep Sharma.
