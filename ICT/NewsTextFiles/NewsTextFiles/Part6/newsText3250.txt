The state highway department will host a public meeting on June 18 to discuss a proposed project designed to improve the safety and traffic flow on U.S. 190 between Interstate 12 and the Claiborne Hill overpass near downtown Covington .

The meeting will be held from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. at the Catholic Charities Northshore office, 69090 East Highway Service Road at the corner of Slemmer Road in Covington.

Its purpose is to inform the public of the proposed project and to provide an opportunity for input from citizens, according to a news release from the state Department of Transportation and Development.

The project is designed to improve the safety and traffic flow on the major north-south commercial artery by restricting turning movements, closing some crossovers, changing traffic signals and adding signals at U-turns, according to the news release.

The meeting was originally scheduled for May 14 but was postponed by the highway department.
