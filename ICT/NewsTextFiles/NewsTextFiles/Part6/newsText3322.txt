
A Texas teen was found dead in her hotel room on the day after her senior prom.

The body of Jacqueline Gomez, 17, was discovered Saturday morning at a Hyatt in north Houston, according to KHOU.

â€œIn the morning hours, the person that was with her found her deceased in her bed," Houston Police Department Detective Mike Miller said. "We are not sure at this hour what the cause of death is."

Police said Gomez's boyfriend called police on Saturday saying that the girl wasn't breathing, according to KTRK.

"There was an indication that there was alcohol in the room," Miller said. "Of course, prescription painkillers is something we're looking at as well."

Miller said Gomez's boyfriend, whose name was not released, was taken in for questioning.

"The boyfriend, at this point, is being completely honest with us and we have no reason to believe that he at all contributed to this death," Miller said. "But in my line of work, you have to be absolutely sure."

One of Gomez's classmates at MacArthur High School reacted to her death.

"It's shocking," Leandra Mendez told the Houston Chronicle. "I can't believe it. I mean, really, I can't believe it."
