The great tragedy in all the many real and imagined stories about James J. Bulger, �Whitey,�� the man who the media and book writers tell us terrorized the City of Boston for decades even though few in the city knew of his existence until he had fled from the city, a profound paradox proposed by people profiting from the pernicious proposition, begging the question can you be terrorized by something you do not know, is the dire situation retired FBI Agent John J. Connolly finds himself entrapped in because he had Whitey as an informant.

Remember the words of the prosecutor Fred Wyshak who when asked why John Connolly went wrong, assuming that he did which I do not, said:��he got too close to the Bulgers and South Boston.��Bulgers? We know of career criminal Whitey. What other Bulger is he referring to? Some suggest it was Whitey�s younger brother �Billy� who if he had not been as pure as the driven snow when it first envelopes the land would surely have been indicted by Wyshak. But because Billy led an honorable and upright life despite all the baubles, bangles, and beads proffered by Wyshak to his scummy witnesses he came up blank. But he perseveres, when Whitey�s nephew showed up at the ongoing O�Brien probation trial he took the time to tell the jury a Bulger was there.

The question then is can a prosecutor who is supposed to be a representative of all the people and not of his own personal prejudices become too involved in a case. It�s hard to see how that is not the case in the Wyshak/Bulger feud. I never had any trouble with Wyshak going after Whitey; rather, I praised him for doing this although his methods of doing it at times left a sour taste in my mouth; for instance, the deals he made not only to throw marshmallow sentences at murderers for their testimony but also to give others involved in murders a complete pass. I�m still watching to see if he has a side deal with the epitome of all evil, Steven Flemmi.

It is Wyshak�s mania that causes Connolly to be confined to prison in Florida. Did�the similarity of Whitey�s and Connolly�s middle initials bring this about? Or perhaps that their forebears came from Galway like those of� Che Guevara� and the� mayor of Galway named Lynch �who hanged his own son��giving us the word lynching�and� James Connolly� of South Boston (whose family is from the Aran islands off Galway)�the first United States Olympic champion, and Jim Connolly who wants to be called James, who� was a lifeguard with John.

I bring this up because my lack of blogging of late has been my desire to put a greater effort into my book �Boston Bamboozled��which I hope will expose the frauds and deceptions surrounding the story about Whitey. It�ll set out what I believe is the true story and expose the maliciousness of those who combined together to try to turn a handful of dirt into precious metal like ancient alchemists.

Few and feeble are those who support John Connolly.�That he remains in prison causes one to wonder whether the federal government has a suppressing effect on Florida justice. As the Florida prosecutor let the FBI agent who� gunned down Todashev, Aaron McFarlane , 41, (a former cop from Oakland who retired on a disability pension of $52,000 but despite the disability has worked for the FBI for ten years, another paradox,) could refuse to be interviewed by the Florida prosecutor, so too one wonders why the Florida Appeals court refused to write a decision on Connolly�s appeal. Does the dirty hand of the Department of Justice reach into that court which was faced with two, if not three, issues that would have voided any sentence of Connolly.

Connolly was convicted of murder with a gun when no evidence was presented he had a gun or was in Florida at the time or the murder; the statute of limitations had passed on the crime of which he was convicted; and his lawyers not properly presenting these issues may have failed to give him a proper defense.

40 years in prison for murder with a gun and no written appellate decision upholding the verdict. Seems odd to me. I guess what happens in Florida stays in Florida. Hardly would I call it the sunshine state.

Connolly, by the way no relation, had a job to do as an FBI agent and he did it. The theory that he wanted John Callahan murdered in Florida because he might turn on him is absurd. Connolly never had contact with Callahan but the guy who did murder him, John Martorano, had contact as did his buddy Stevie Flemmi. Connolly�s name was as much thrown into the motive for killing Callahan as Joe �the Animal� Barboza threw in the name of Joseph Salvati to cover for his buddy Vincent �Jimmy the Bear� Flemmi, yes, the brother of Stevie one of Wyshak�s star witnesses.

The way things stand the FBI agent who was instrumental in bringing down the Mafia in Boston and never fired a gun at anyone is to die in prison. What�s almost as shocking is the absence of the outrage in the FBI over this. That to me is like leaving a fellow soldier on the battlefield.

Connolly is not as pure as snow. He might have done some indiscrete things after he left the FBI such as trying to help out Stevie Flemmi, but that he is going to be imprisoned for ever because of that while murderers walk free makes a mockery of justice. It truly does.
