
FRANKLIN, Ky. (AP) -- Just days before the Senate primary in Kentucky, Republican Mitch McConnell and Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes brought messages of change to the same small town.

Grimes and McConnell have big leads over their primary opponents in polls taken ahead of Tuesday's voting.

Grimes told a gathering of about 30 people in Franklin on Saturday that it's time to change senators after 30 years. She criticizes McConnell for opposing increasing the minimum wage and measures ensuring women are paid the same salaries as men.

McConnell told a group of about 30 people at a Franklin restaurant that it's is time to change the Senate to Republican control and put him in charge. He says President Barack Obama's agenda has devastated Kentucky's coal industry and upended the country's health care system.
