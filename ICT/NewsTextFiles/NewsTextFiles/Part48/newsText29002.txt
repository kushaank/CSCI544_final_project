Ohio researchers seeking ways to prevent premature births gathered at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center today to report on findings of a collaborative effort launched a year ago.

And, in conjunction with the meeting, a local program was announced to support families with sick and premature babies hospitalized immediately after birth.

The March of Dimes Family Support program launched at the neonatal intensive care unit of the UC Medical Center is designed to provide information and comfort to help parents cope â€“ from the time a baby is born prematurely through the transition from hospital to home. Such programs have been implemented by the March of Dimes at more than 130 hospitals nationwide.

The UC Medical Center and Cincinnati Childrenâ€™s Hospital Medical Center are among the partners in the March of Dimes Prematurity Research Centerâ€™s Ohio Collaborative, a team-based initiative that brings together geneticists, molecular biologists, epidemiologists, engineers, computer scientists and others to explore the causes of early births.
