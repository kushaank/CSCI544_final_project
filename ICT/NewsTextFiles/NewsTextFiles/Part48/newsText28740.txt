An assistant district attorney in Wyoming County has been charged with criminal trespass and assault.

Sheriff’s deputies say they charged 33-year-old Marshall Kelly of Attica following a domestic incident Sunday morning.

Wyoming County District Attorney Donald O’Geen issued a statement Monday saying in part, Mr. Kelly has worked with my office as an assistant district attorney for a little over four years. Upon learning of the allegations involved in the incident, I instructed the sheriff to seize his credentials. I then terminated his employment with my office... My office has always taken a strong stance against domestic violence and this type of behavior will not be tolerated in any form.

Kelly is due back in court on June 9 to answer to the charges. A stay away order of protection was issued.
