U.S. Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes of Kentucky speaks during the Tennessee Democratic Party's Jackson Day dinner at Musicians Hall of Fame at Municipal Auditorium in Nashville, Tenn., Saturday, May 17, 2014.

The Tennessee Democratic Party set a new record with its annual Jackson Day fund-raiser, bringing in more than $500,000, the party said Monday.

Herron said just one previous Jackson Day event grossed more money, and it featured President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Gov. Phil Bredesen, Gov. Ned McWherter and U.S. Rep. Harold Ford Jr. This yearâ€™s event, with Kentucky Secretary of State and U.S. Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes giving the keynote speech, was the most successful in party history in terms of net dollars raised.
