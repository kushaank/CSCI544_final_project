
For every teaching job opening in the public schools in Springfield, Mo., 144 people apply.

District officials believe a competitive salary and benefits package is the biggest reason why so many people apply, according to a report from the Springfield News-Leader.

Teacher pay in Springfield starts at $34,088 and tops out $64,240 for those with 30 years' experience and a doctoral degree. The benefits package includes 13 sick days, and the district pays 100 percent of the health care premiums for its 3,900 employees.

Though the Springfield district -- which is one of the largest of Missouri 's 520 districts -- has one of the better benefits package, its starting pay and top pay for teachers barely makes the top 100 in the state.

Of the 20 largest districts in Missouri, or those with 10,000 students or more, Springfield's starting pay was ranked at the very bottom, according to the News-Leader.
