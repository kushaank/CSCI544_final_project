
MILWAUKEE (AP) - Former Wisconsin Gov. Patrick Lucey is being remembered as a great family and religious man who helped the state and the Democratic party.

Lucey was a hard-nosed Democrat who died May 10 at age 96. He was Wisconsin's governor from 1970 to 1977.

Other current and former Wisconsin governors gathered at his funeral Monday in Milwaukee.

Afterward, former Gov. Tommy Thompson, a Republican, credited Lucey with growing the Democratic party into a "tremendous organization, much to my chagrin and all Republicans."

Gov. Scott Walker also attended, along with former Wisconsin governors Martin Schreiber, Scott McCallum and Jim Doyle.

Lucey left office midway through his second term to serve as President Jimmy Carter's ambassador to Mexico. He also ran for U.S. vice president as an independent in 1980.
