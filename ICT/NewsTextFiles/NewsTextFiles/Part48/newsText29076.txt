
HARTFORD, CT -- Gov. Dannel Malloy said that he would not sign a bill that would have inadvertently banned chocolate milk from Connecticut's school lunchrooms.

The state General Assembly last week approved nutrition legislation that would have threatened to remove chocolate milk from public schools by restricting the amount of added sodium in all foods. Chocolate milk was not the intended target of the bill, but would have been banned since it contains 90mg. of added sodium, which is above the proposed limit.

The legislation has not yet reached the governor's desk, but he said he would veto it, citing concerns that it could lead to an overall reduction in milk consumption among schoolchildren across the state.
