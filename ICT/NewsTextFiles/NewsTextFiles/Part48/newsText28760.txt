Deanna Geiger and Janine Nelson became the first gay Oregon couple to marry Monday after a judge struck down the state's ban on same-gender marriage.

The pair, of Portland, exchanged vows in the lobby of the Multnomah County building in Southeast Portland, minutes after Judge Michael McShane made his historic decision.

Surrounded by a crowd of supporters, including many Multnomah County officials, Geiger and Nelson took their vows under the officiation of their friend Bill Griesar.

The words were typical marriage exchanges, but the couple had been waiting to say them for 31 years.

"I give you this ring as a token of my commitment and love," Geiger said.

With that, Griesar announced, "It is now with great pleasure that I pronounce you spouses for life."

Teary-eyed, the pair exchanged a kiss, as cheers erupted from the crowd. They exited the building under a snowfall of rose petals thrown by county officials.

Other gay couples stood in the County Assessor's office, awaiting their chance to obtain a marriage license. Many of them planned to wed Monday at the Melody Ballroom.
