
--$157.5 million of sewer revenue bonds.

The Rating Outlook is Stable.

The bonds are secured by net sewer revenues after payment of operations        and maintenance expenses.

WHOLESALER, HEALTHY SERVICE AREA: The district is the wholesale provider        of essential wastewater treatment services to a sizable suburban service        area of about 185,000 people on Utah's economically resilient Wasatch        Front.

SATISFACTORY COVERAGE: The district's debt service coverage (DSC) ratio        was adequate at 1.4x in 2013. Fitch expects coverage to rise gradually        over the next few years.

STRONG RESERVE POSITION: The district has consistently maintained strong        liquidity with unrestricted cash and investments equaling a very high        2,258 days of operating cash at Dec. 31, 2013.

STABLE REVENUES, RATE FLEXIBILITY: The utility's revenues are diverse        and very stable with wholesale sewer fees and property taxes as the        primary revenue streams. Rates remain affordable even after a series of        very large rate increases have been imposed.

WELL POSITIONED FOR GROWTH: The district completed construction of a        major expansion of its treatment plant in 2011, improving the        environmental quality of its discharges and providing capacity for        expected growth through the next two decades. Future capital needs are        limited, and management plans no further borrowing.

HIGH DEBT LEVELS: The district's debt burden is about twice the median        for 'AA' rated water and sewer utilities at $851 per capita. High debt        levels reflect significant recent investments in the system and are        expected to decline gradually over the next decade.

COVERAGE CHANGES TO DRIVE RATING: The rating is sensitive to shifts in        debt service coverage and rate setting behavior. A failure to raise        rates to keep up with cost increases and capital needs could put        downward pressure on the rating. A planned resumption of 3% to 4% annual        rate increases could put upward pressure on the rating.

The district is located approximately 40 miles northwest of downtown        Salt Lake City and covers about 73 square miles primarily in the central        portion of Weber County. The district provides wholesale wastewater        treatment to a population of roughly 185,000 approximately, through 16        municipal customers. The district also provides retail sewer treatment        services to small areas that account for less than 1% of the district's        annual revenues. The district's sewer system consists of one 65.1        million gallon per day wastewater treatment plant that was recently        expanded to accommodate growth through 2035.

The district serves an economically solid suburban service area on the        northern edge of the dynamic Salt Lake City metropolitan area. Large        employers in the area include Hill Air Force Base, Davis County and        Weber County School Districts, the U.S. Department of Treasury, the IRS,        and McKay-Dee Hospital Center. Unemployment trends below the national        average with Weber County at 5% and the Ogden-Clearfield metropolitan        statistical area at 4.5% in March 2014, compared to the nation's 6.8%        non-seasonally adjusted jobless rate. Median household income for the        county is average at 104% of the national median and 95% of the state        level.

Financial performance is solid. DSC has declined with an increase in        debt service for the district's 2010 bonds coming on line in 2012, but        coverage remains both adequate for the current rating category and        slightly ahead of prior projections. Fitch calculated coverage fell to        1.3x in 2012 before increasing to 1.4x in 2013. Both results beat the        issuer's projections. Coverage is slim compared to retail water and        sewer systems at this rating category, but compares reasonably well to        other wholesalers.

Fitch believes recent coverage is adequate, given extraordinarily stable        revenues, strong liquidity, limited capital needs and solid rate        flexibility. The district's revenues are dominated by property taxes and        flat sewer fees that do not vary with flows, reducing the need for the        excess coverage to withstand revenue volatility. Economically cyclical        connection fees account for less than 10% of revenues. Free        cash-to-depreciation was low at 68% in 2013, but is expected to rise        with coverage over the next several years. Free cash flow (after payment        of operating expenses and debt service) provides resources to invest in        and maintain system assets. The median for rated systems is 91%.

The district's liquidity has remained solidly above 'AAA' rating        category medians with reserves above 2,000 days of operations since        2009, providing ample cushion against any plausible revenue shortfalls.        Unrestricted cash and investments rose to $35 million (2,258 days of        operating expenses) in 2013 from $32.3 million (2,349 days) in 2012. The        district plans to spend cash down to about $20 million over the next        five years; however, days cash would remain solidly in excess of 'AAA'        medians even after the reduction.

The district's board has raised rates as needed to maintain solid        financial performance and appears to have solid rate flexibility        remaining. Central Weber more than tripled its rates over the past five        years to pay debt service on its expanded treatment plant. Rates remain        reasonable at the retail level despite the rising treatment costs. Local        retail bills reflect both Central Weber's treatment cost and the cost of        local collection services. Charges are moderate at just 0.6% of median        household incomes in the city of Ogden, the largest wholesale customer.        Management held rates steady in 2014 to give ratepayers relief after a        period of very large rate increases.

While the utility could afford to give some rate relief, the rating        could come under downward pressure if the utility's board hesitated to        raise rates to maintain full cost recovery and to adequately maintain        system assets. Management plans to implement 3% to 4% rate increases        over the next five years, which would likely put upward pressure on the        rating as coverage increased and free cash to depreciation approached        100%.

The wholesaler's current high debt levels reflect the recent expansion        of the plant (its main capital asset). The expansion positions the        utility well to accommodate the service area's growth over the next        decade and beyond. Debt at the current level is unlikely to put downward        pressure on the rating so long as the utility sets rates to maintain        solid coverage. The district's five-year capital plan is manageable at        $30.7 million and will be funded entirely from cash, allowing debt        levels to decline with gradual amortization. Amortization is healthy        with 37% of debt repaid in 10 years and 92% in the 20 years. Debt is        projected to fall to about $739 per capita in 2018, roughly 140% of the        median projected debt for rated systems, down from about 185% of the        median current debt burden at the end of 2013.
