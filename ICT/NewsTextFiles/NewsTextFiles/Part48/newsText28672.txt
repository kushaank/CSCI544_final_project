
The trial of a 29-year-old California man authorities say shot at two vehicles in southwestern Idaho has been delayed.

Lajai Pridgette had been scheduled for trial Monday on charges of possession of counterfeit credit cards and equipment, illegal possession of a firearm and transportation of a stolen vehicle.

The Sacramento man's trial has been pushed back to July 14 to allow the defense time to examine documents recently turned over by prosecutors.

Documents filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Boise include a forensic examiner's analysis that bullets fired in two cars on Interstate 84 in October came from the gun in the car driven by Pridgette.

Pridgette has pleaded not guilty.

The Idaho Statesman reports charges directly related to the shootings could be filed later in state court.
