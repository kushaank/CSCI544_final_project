
United States Steel Corp. CEO Mario Longhi and Leo Gerard, international president of the United Steelworkers, discuss the challenges the steel industry is facing due to unregulated foreign imports of tubular products at U.S. Steelâ€™s Irvin Works in West Mifflin. In July, U.S. Steel and other domestic steel manufacturers filed a petition with the Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission to seek antidumping relief. U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker said about 75 percent of the Commerce Departmentâ€™s total ongoing trade remedy investigations are steel-related.
