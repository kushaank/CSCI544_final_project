
California Chrome and jockey Victor Espinoza cross the finsih line as the winners of the 140th Kentucky Derby.

Itâ€™s possible that Kentucky Derby winner California Chrome wonâ€™t run in the June 7 Belmont Stakes, his trainer said.

The issue is nasal strips, CNN reported . The 3-year-old horse wore them across his nose to help with breathing while winning the Derby and the Preakness Stakes.

California-based trainer Doug O'Neill told the Associated Press that two years ago, New York racing officials said his horse, Iâ€™ll Have Another, couldnâ€™t wear a nasal strip in the Belmont.

Officials with the New York State Gaming Commission said a decision on whether to allow the strips this year would be left to the state's racing association. No request to use them in the Belmont Stakes, which is the third leg of racingâ€™s Triple Crown, has been received, they said.

If the answer is no, a decision on whether California Chrome will run will rest with co-owner Perry Martin , trainer Art Sherman said.

"He might not run if they say you can't run with a nasal strip,â€� Sherman said. â€œHe's very funny about things like that."
