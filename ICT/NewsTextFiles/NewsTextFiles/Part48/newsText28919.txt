"There is an urgent need to continue to stand for girls' education," said Kersey, founder and CEO.

"While we finish the school year in the U.S., 57 million children around the world aren't getting an education at all," said Kersey.  "Nearly 50 percent of those children live in sub-Saharan Africa, where the Unstoppable Foundation is focusing our work."

Kersey created The Unstoppable Foundation in 2008, with the vision that every child has the right to an education.   Since then the Foundation's work has created 56 primary schools and two secondary schools for girls where 6,000 children are receiving an education and a daily nutritious meal.  To ensure that the education of girls is sustainable and ongoing, the Foundation's model also provides access to clean water, sanitation and healthcare for 17,000 people, and income training to 2,600 adults.

"When a woman earns a dollar, 70 percent of that goes back to improving the family and community.  This underscores the need to provide sustainable education for girls," said Kersey.

The Unstoppable Foundation utilizes the "Sponsor A Village" approach to ensure that education is sustainable and communities are self-supporting.  This proven model provides the entire community with access to clean water and sanitation, food and nutrition, healthcare, and education for the parents to earn an income.
