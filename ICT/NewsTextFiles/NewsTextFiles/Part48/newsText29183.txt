
Ten high school seniors will participate in the discussion, along with various Connecticut leaders, including Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, U.S. Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy.

Members of the audience will include juniors and seniors from the Hartford school and parents. Duncan was previously scheduled to visit the science and engineering high school in January, but a snow storm scuttled his trip. He visited Hartford a year ago to discuss the federal government’s efforts to improve school security following the Newtown school shooting.
