
The Supreme Court on Monday granted interim bail of three weeks to Tehelka editor Tarun Tejpal - who is in a Goa jail charged with rape and sexual assault - to attend his mother Shakuntala Tejpal's funeral.

A bench of justices B.S. Chauhan and A.K. Sikri, granted relief to Tejpal after his advocate Sandeep Kapur informed the court that his mother died on Sunday and the cremation is scheduled for this evening.

The matter was mentioned in the morning but the bench said that it will pass the order only after going through the case file and said that it will consider in chamber after finishing all cases listed for hearing.

Shakuntala Tejpal, 87, was suffering from brain tumour and died in Panaji on Sunday.

Sandeep Kapoor, Tejpal's legal counsel, said: "Tejpal's mother expired yesterday (Sunday). The decision is yet to be taken whether the final rites would be conducted in Goa or Delhi. He said that the family members will take the call on it."

Tejpal had recently met his mother at a private hospital in Mapusa after obtaining the court's permission for the visit.

The bench then took up the case in chamber at 1.50pm and passed the order. Briefing about the order Kapur told reporters that Tejpal has been granted interim bail for three weeks.

Fifty-year-old Tejpal has been charge-sheeted for allegedly raping, sexually harassing and outraging the modesty of a junior colleague during an event held at a hotel in Goa in November last year.

Tejpal was arrested on November 30, 2013. He has been accused of sexually assaulting the victim on November 7 and repeating the offence the next day.

He is currently in judicial custody and lodged at Sada sub-jail in Goa's Vasco town.
