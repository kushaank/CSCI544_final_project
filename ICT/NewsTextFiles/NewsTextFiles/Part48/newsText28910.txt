TALLAHASSEE, FL (WTXL) -- A man was arrested after he bit his girlfriend's lip off during an argument, said police.

The victim was with her boyfriend, Michael Johnson, studying at the Starbucks on West Tennessee Street Sunday night.

The victim told police that Johnson was getting several text messages from other girls. When she asked him about it, the victim said that Johnson became irate and was yelling at her. After Johnson slammed his fist into the wall outside of Starbucks, the victim tried to leave.

The victim told police that Johnson leaned down for what she thought was a kiss. However, instead of a kiss, Johnson bit her lip off and then punched her in the face, said police.

Police said that after he spit her lip on the ground, Johnson was repeatedly yelling, "Oh my god, oh my god."

According to police, Johnson took the victim to the hospital. According to the victim, once Johnson took her to the hospital, he left her there saying he was going to go and find her lip.

An officer later found Johnson searching through the bushes at Starbucks looking for the victim's lip.

Johson was arrested and taken to the Leon County Jail.
