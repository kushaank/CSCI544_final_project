
FLEMINGTON, N.J. -- A state appellate court has ruled that a mother's rights  were not violated by a judge's decision that barred her from ranting about her  children and ex-husband on Facebook.

The restriction came after the woman's ex-husband's family and  Hunterdon County prosecutors argued that her Facebook postings were frightening,  saying they referenced the Book of Revelation, serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, Satan  and Adolf Hitler.

"You can talk about what you want to talk about, but don't  reference (your husband) or the children," the judge told her. "That's off  limits."

But in 2012, the mother returned to Facebook and began using a code  word, "Camelot," to refer to her family. The judge found that the posting violated  her probation.

She appealed, claiming the order violated her rights of free  speech and due process because it was too vague.

The appellate panel  disagreed, finding the order was specific and didn't prevent her from making posts  about other issues. The court said the special condition was imposed with the  purpose of advancing her rehabilitation.

The woman, who has been diagnosed  with bipolar disorder, was arrested in May 2011 after she tried to take her  children to Canada in violation of a custody order. She eventually pleaded guilty  to interference with custody, and prosecutors dropped the kidnapping charge.
