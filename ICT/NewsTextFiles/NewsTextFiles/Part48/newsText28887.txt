
The U.S. Department of Stateâ€™s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs has awarded a grant for over $350,000 to plan and conduct a regional training course May 12-30 in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. The course is for senior managers working to safeguard communities by clearing landmines and unexploded ordnance.

The training course, conducted by the Center for International Stabilization and Recovery (CISR) at James Madison University and the Tajikistan Mine Action Centre, brings together senior representatives from organizations based in Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, and Yemen.

In order to strengthen the organizational management capacity of local organizations, and to develop a regional network among participants, CISR integrates business management principles and practical field experience to develop a specialized and targeted curriculum. Through this course, the Department will help countries more effectively clear landmines and other unexploded ordnance, saving lives, preventing injuries, and helping set the stage for reconstruction and economic development.

Since 1993, the United States has invested more than $2.2 billion in more than 90 countries around the world to reduce the harmful effects of the explosive remnants of conventional weapons in post-conflict environments.
