A picture of a California firefighter taking a break from battling a blaze in San Diego County has gone viral.

San Marcos firefighter Tim Bergon took the quick selfie to let his wife know he was okay, but it quickly spread to thousands over social media after the owners of "Plan 9 Alehouse" posted the selfie on their Facebook page to say thank you.

"It touched us, so we passed it on," the Alehouse owners, who are friends with the firefighter and his family, said.
