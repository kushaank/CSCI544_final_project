ENFIELD, Conn. (AP) — The state of Connecticut has suspended the license of an Enfield dentist after the death of a patient who was having 20 teeth extracted.

The Journal Inquirer reports that Dr. Rashmi Patel faces a June 18 hearing before the Connecticut State Dental Commission.

The state alleges Patel’s actions led to the death of patient Judith Gan. The 64-year-old was having extractions and implants performed on Feb. 17 when she became unresponsive. She was transported to Baystate Medical Center in Springfield where she was pronounced dead.

Michael Kogut, Patel’s attorney, says there is no medical information indicating that Patel’s actions resulted in Gan’s death.

Among other things, the state alleges Patel failed to respond appropriately when the woman’s oxygen levels dropped, and improperly attempted to extract the teeth in a single visit.
