U.S. Supreme Court to hear whistle-blower case of a fired air marshal who revealed security lapses.

The U.S. Supreme Court announced Monday that it will hear the whistle-blower case of a former federal air marshal who was fired in 2006 for revealing what he thought were crucial security lapses, including government plans to remove undercover officers from airline flights.

The nation's highest court agreed to consider the matter at the request of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which terminated Robert MacLean of south Orange County on the grounds that his disclosures to the news media threatened national security.

The 1989 law prohibits retaliation against federal workers for disclosing information that exposes mismanagement, abuses of power, the waste of government money and serious threats to public health and safety.

Government attorneys have argued that MacLean, who was once stationed at Los Angeles International Airport and is now a solar power consultant, violated agency rules that bar the release of "security sensitive information," a nonclassified designation.
