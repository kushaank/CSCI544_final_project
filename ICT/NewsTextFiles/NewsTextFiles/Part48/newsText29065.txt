
Burns & Wilcox intends to increase its North Carolina presence by opening an office in Wilmington, the insurance and brokerage company announced in a press release Monday.

With the expansion, Michigan-based Burns & Wilcox will now have offices in three North Carolina cities including Charlotte and Morehead City.

“Burns & Wilcox has a long history of doing business with retail brokers and agents in metro-Wilmington, and we now have a dedicated team that will strengthen our position in the city and surrounding communities,” Alan Jay Kaufman, chairman, president and CEO of the Kaufman Financial Group and Burns & Wilcox, said in the release.

Kaufman also said he hopes the proximity of the new offices to University of North Carolina Wilmington will provide a wider selection of job candidates in the future.

“The office is also located near a top university, which will deepen the pool of talented professionals from which we recruit,” Kaufman said in a statement.

The 2,500-square-foot space is at 1051 Military Cutoff Road, Suite 210, and will be managed by Kasey Vaughn, vice president and managing director of Burns & Wilcox North Carolina. In addition to managing the Wilmington space, Vaughn will continue to manage the Charlotte and Morehead City offices.

Burns & Wilcox, North America’s largest privately held specialty insurance wholesaler, is part of the Kaufman Financial Group, and specializes in commercial and professional liability, property, marine and personal insurance. The North Carolina division of the company is further recognized for its expertise in excess flood insurance and its condominium program, according to the release.
