
Barbara Madeloni earlier this month was elected the next president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association. Her two-year term begins in July.

Madeloni has an extensive history in education and activism; she is an outspoken critic of standardized testing and its use in teacher evaluations. In a wide-ranging interview, she talked to Learning Lab about her goals for the union, the characteristics of a good classroom, and more.

Learning Lab reports on innovation and reform in education. Weâ€™re interested in what experiments are happening in Massachusetts k-12 schools, what is being learned, and who is behind them. We want to understand how Massachusetts students will be learning two, five, and ten years from now.

How do you pick a school? For some families it's the school's distance from home, or the school's performance on standardized tests.
