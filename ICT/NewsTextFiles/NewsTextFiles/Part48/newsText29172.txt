Within just a matter of hours, the photo received more than 30,000 likes and was seen by many more people.

Although Bergon is smiling in the photograph, it's clear that the firefighters are exhausted by the battle against the raging wildfire.

Bergon took the selfie while fighting the Cocos Fire, which was 89 percent contained as of Monday morning . The fire charred more than 2,500 acres and destroyed 36 homes and one commercial building.

People from all over the country took the opportunity to say thanks to the firefighters who were working hard to control the wildfire.
