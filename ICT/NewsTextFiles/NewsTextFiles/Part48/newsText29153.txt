
An analysis of two recent Associated Press articles leads to the conclusion that the American people must either pay added energy taxes, based on normal human activity, or suffer the consequences.

The May 7 article included John Holdren, the president�s science adviser, promising bigger wild fires, worse flooding, more severe winters and storms and longer allergy seasons if something is not done to reverse conditions thought to alter the environment.

Holdren and Obama promise to allay these disasters with proper funding and regulations. The May 8 article blames green house gases in general, and carbon dioxide in particular, for causing the earth to overheat.

This type of wealth confiscation scheme often is used to shake down innocent citizens. It�s known as a �protection racket.� Organized crime families use these tactics to extort money from restaurant owners, for example, who are told by the gangsters that the restaurant �might catch fire� unless a monthly payment is made.

It appears we now are faced with choosing between higher energy taxes or the prospect that Holdren and Obama will not have the funding to stop the floods, fires, tornadoes and snow storms.

It also should be noted that Holdren has expressed his belief that the best way to relieve these environmental conditions is by drastically reducing the human population. Holdren�s views can be found in a text book that he co-authored in 1978 titled, �Ecoscience: Population, Resources, Environment,� promoting social Darwinism through eugenics.
