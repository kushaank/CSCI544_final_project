The Georgia Department of Public Health has rescinded a job offer to a California doctor due to his comments on homosexuality, religion and evolution, reports Georgia Health News.

Dr. Eric Walsh of Pasadena interviewed for the position of director of the North Georgia Health District and had received an offer letter with a start date of mid-June, contingent on a background check, GHN says.

Georgia officials said that Walsh, who is also a Seventh-day Adventist, did not mention that he had recently been placed on leave from his job as public health director in Pasadena because of sermons he gave on homosexuality and evolution, according to the Los Angeles Times.
