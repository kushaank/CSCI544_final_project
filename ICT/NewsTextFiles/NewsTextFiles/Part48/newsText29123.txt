
US Charge De Affaires David Young says the American embassy will continue talking against political violence in the country.

Mr Young says the US mission will not tire in condemning political violence because it is an affront to democracy.

He was speaking on Friday evening when the US embassy public affairs officer Janet Deutsh hosted several senior journalists and media heads to commemorate this year’s World Press Freedom Day.

Mr Young said political violence has remained an issue of concern to the US embassy.

“We will continue to raise concern over political violence. We believe dialogue is key to resolving any differences between political parties,” he said.

And Mr Young lauded Zambian journalists for their role in reporting about political violence and other matters affecting democracy.

“I really appreciate your work as journalists, especially that I was once a journalist before I ventured into diplomacy,” Mr Young said.

He said the role of journalists is critical in a democracy.

When HH rushed to SADC and Commonwealth soon 13 moons ago, you laughed!…Ok Ok ok, we definitely need the intervention of the World, to end this mad violence by PF!

Ladies and gentlemen, let’s acknowledge that the PF govt has neither the will nor the desire to halt political violence in Zambia. We need to escalate this problem and get help from regional and international agencies. We need to start identifying individuals perpetrating violence and advocate for targeted sanctions against them and their families.
