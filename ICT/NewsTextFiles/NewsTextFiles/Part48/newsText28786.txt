Credit Suisse Group AG will pay $715 million to New York's top financial regulator as part of its $2.6 billion settlement with U.S. authorities over allegations that it helped wealthy American clients evade taxes, the agency said Monday.

The settlement is the largest fine extracted from a bank by the New York Department of Financial Services since its formation in 2011. The largest previously was a $340 million settlement with British bank Standard Chartered PLC over alleged sanction violations.

The New York agency is also taking steps to ensure three Credit Suisse employees who were previously indicted won't continue to be paid by the bank, the agency said. The employees are Markus Walder, Susanne Ruegg Meier and Marco Parenti Adami. Court filings indicate the three were among those charged in 2011 by U.S. prosecutors. A Credit Suisse spokesman declined to comment.

The agreement with New York also calls for a monitor to continue reviewing the involvement of individual employees in the alleged misconduct, including directors and officers, Superintendent of Financial Services Benjamin Lawsky said in a statement. The monitor also will review the timeliness and effectiveness of the bank's efforts to correct the misconduct.

Mr. Lawsky won't seek to revoke Credit Suisse's state license, a possible threat that could have forced the bank out of business in the U.S. The bank's New York representative office, which Mr. Lawsky said played a crucial role in helping clients evade taxes, has been shut down, the agency said.

The question of whether Mr. Lawsky would revoke the bank's New York license has been closely followed as the negotiations with Credit Suisse accelerated in recent months.

"Facilitating tax evasion was a strategy and business model that the firm engaged in for decades," Mr. Lawsky said in the statement. "It was decidedly not the result of the conduct of just a few bad apples."

Mr. Lawsky began his investigation of Credit Suisse in late February following the release of a report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations that outlined how Swiss banks, including Credit Suisse, helped customers avoid paying U.S. taxes, a person familiar with the matter has previously said.

Mr. Lawsky's investigation focused on whether the bank took steps to help customers avoid paying state taxes and whether the bank's employees made misrepresentations to the agency, this person has said.

Mr. Lawsky's investigation accelerated quickly. In April, the New York agency sent a subpoena to Credit Suisse demanding the bank turn over emails, personnel files, travel records, expenses, hard drives and other materials from its New York office, the person familiar with the matter said.

Mr. Lawsky and his office have emerged as key players in high-profile crackdowns on some of the world's biggest banks since the agency was created when Gov. Andrew Cuomo and state lawmakers merged the former state banking and insurance departments.

Many large foreign banks are regulated by New York because they have licenses to operate branches in the state, giving Mr. Lawsky a powerful tool in enforcement matters.

The former assistant U.S. attorney also has pledged to take steps to hold individual executives of financial firms accountable for alleged misconduct, as well as look for additional ways to penalize firms aside from imposing monetary fines.

The settlement with Credit Suisse follows large fines that the New York financial-services department has issued against other major banks.

In 2012, it fined Standard Chartered $340 million for alleged violations of U.S. sanctions. Mr. Lawsky had threatened to revoke the bank's state license in that case but ultimately didn't take that step.

The agency also has reached settlements with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC and other firms.
