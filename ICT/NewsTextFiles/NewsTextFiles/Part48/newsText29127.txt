
President Obama’s Cabinet reshuffling would add a Hispanic in nominations to come late this week.

WASHINGTON — President Obama has tapped San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development, a Cabinet reshuffling that would add a Hispanic to an administration that has faced criticism for not appointing more minorities to top jobs.

Castro, who drew national attention when he gave the keynote address at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, would take the spot now held by Shaun Donovan, who will become the next director of the Office of Management and Budget, according to Democratic officials familiar with the proposed moves. The White House is expected to announce the nominations late this week.

Donovan has led the nation’s top housing agency since the start of the Obama administration and has been rumored for years to be up for consideration for other posts. The current OMB director, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, has been nominated to be the new secretary of health and human services.

Castro, 39, is serving his third two-year term as mayor of the nation’s seventh-largest city. He and his twin brother, Joaquin Castro, a first-term Democratic congressman representing a San Antonio-area district, are rising stars in the Democratic Party.
