
MANCHESTER — A global workforce expert told Mount Washington College graduates Sunday they are the leading edge in shaping the future largely through getting an education designed to meet marketplace demands.

“You have redefined the workplace. You have brought us untethered employees. You have brought us virtual work,” global human resources consultant and author Lance Jensen Richards said.

Richards told graduates they belong to the “free agent nation of workers” required in a knowledge-based economy that is making the static, 9-to-5, cubicle-style workforce obsolete.

More than 500 graduates received bachelor’s and associate’s degrees and diplomas at commencement ceremonies held at the Verizon Wireless Arena said Francis Mulgrew, who took over as college president two weeks ago.

“You have developed character. You have displayed endurance. You have developed your strengths,” magna cum laude graduate Jason S. Burgess told his classmates in giving the student address.

“I encourage you to make bold moves and to take charge of your future,” added Burgess, who received an associate degree in business administration and will continue his studies in the bachelor’s program.
