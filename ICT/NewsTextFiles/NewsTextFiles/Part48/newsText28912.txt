
AVON LAKE � With plans already in motion to expand operations at the Ohio Assembly Plant, state Sen. Gayle Manning and state Rep. Matt Lundy have announced $700,000 in state funds to support Ford Motor Company operations in Avon Lake.

A $200,000 state grant from the Clean Ohio Assistance Fund was awarded for an assessment of the General Industries Redevelopment Project property on Olive Street in Elyria.

�The remediation of the General Industries site is critical to protecting the health and safety of the Elyria community, and I�m thankful that these funds will allow the project to continue ensuring Elyria is a great place to live and work for generations to come,� Manning said.

As part of Elyria�s General Industries Redevelopment Project, the monies will help spur a Phase II environmental assessment on the property of the former General Industries site which burned down in 2008.

Once fully assessed, city officials will look at ways to redevelop the property, bringing in new jobs and revenue for the city.

According to Lundy, the grant will go toward evaluating and addressing environmental issues to prepare the property for redevelopment. The funds will include the installation of 47 soil borings, in which they test the quality of the soil and a geophysical study to test water quality.

�An environmental assessment is needed to reclaim and repurpose this site,� Lundy said. �We want to make use of this abandoned property, but we also want to make sure the land can be redeveloped properly and safely.
