An elderly woman, allegedly run down by pretty pro surfer Jill Hansen, believes she was the victim of an attempted carjacking.

Cops have called Wednesday’s incident a case of road rage but Elizabeth Conklin, 73, believes that Hansen – a pro surfer who also has a line of surf wear – wanted to steal her car.

Conklin, who has two black eyes from the beating, said she had just parked her BMW at her building and can’t remember anything else.

“I drove home and I drove into my parking garage and I parked in my normal parking place and I got out and all of a sudden I woke up in an ambulance,” Conklin said.

The senior citizen says she owes her life to a neighbor who witnessed the incident. He distracted Hansen by bashing in the back window of her car with a crowbar — stopping her from hitting Conklin again.

“He saw her in her car getting ready to hit me again. He totally saved my life,” Conklin told ABC News .

Hansen took off on foot, leaving her own car behind, and was arrested a short time later, police said.

Hansen has been charged with attempted murder and is being held in jail in lieu of $1 million bail.
