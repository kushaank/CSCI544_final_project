
Liberal billionaire Tom Steyer will host Vice President Joe Biden at his San Francisco home May 28 for a Democratic National Committee fundraiser, according to a source familiar with the event’s planning.

It’s the latest indication that Steyer, a vocal opponent of the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline and an outspoken advocate for tackling climate change, is building strong ties to Democrats in Washington.

President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid have both made appearances at Steyer-hosted fundraisers in the past year.

News of the event comes as Steyer, a former hedge fund manager, is laying plans to make climate change a major issue in the midterm elections. Steyer has said his super PAC, NextGen Climate Action, could spend more than $100 million — half from his personal fortune and half from green-minded donors — this year. NextGen is slated to detail its midterm strategy at a briefing in Washington, D.C., this week, a source familiar with the issue said.

Steyer spent millions last year on the Massachusetts Senate and Virginia governor’s races. While the totality of his 2014 plans remains unclear, Steyer has said he hopes to spend money in the Florida governor’s race and the Iowa Senate race.

Republicans have criticized Steyer’s growing involvement in politics. They’ve also bashed Reid and other Democrats for attending his fundraisers at the same time that railing against the Koch brothers has become a prominent liberal theme.

A DNC spokesman confirmed the news of the fundraiser.
