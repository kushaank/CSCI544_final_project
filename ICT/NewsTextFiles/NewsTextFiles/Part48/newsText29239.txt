
(KUTV) One Utah lawmaker wants to bring back the firing squad after a botched execution in Oklahoma, where the prisoner did not die for almost 45 minutes.

Representative Paul Ray says he plans to sponsor legislation to make the firing squad a secondary form of execution.

The firing squad was just banned in Utah several years ago.
