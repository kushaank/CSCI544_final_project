WASHINGTON (AP) — What happens when you invite Vice President Joe Biden to your prom? Chances are he won't show. But he doesn't ignore it, either.

That's what happened when Talia Maselli invited Biden to her high school prom in Newington, Conn. The student reached out last fall knowing Biden's dance card would likely fill up.

Biden couldn't make it, but he sent a handwritten card and a corsage — baby's breath, white roses, and red, white and blue ribbons. Biden's office says he was touched by the invitation and personally picked out the corsage so Maselli would feel special.

Biden says in the note that he's flattered but his schedule wouldn't let him attend. Biden's office also is arranging for Maselli to visit the White House to meet with Biden in July.
