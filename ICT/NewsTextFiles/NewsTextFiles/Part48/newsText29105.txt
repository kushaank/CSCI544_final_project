
NEW YORK - Mayor Bill de Blasio is unveiling an ambitious plan to make New York City a more attractive destination for high-tech jobs.

De Blasio kicked off "Internet Week" on Monday by outlining his plans to help the city's tech sector known as "Silicon Alley."

He says his administration wants to make sure every neighborhood in the city is wired for high-speed broadband Internet access.

He also wants to turn 10,000 little-used payphones into Internet hot spots.

And he announced a $10 million program to train New Yorkers to be better qualified for tech sector jobs.

The mayor said Monday he's launching a task force to aid with the projects. Many of the plans will take years to finish.

Currently, there are about 291,000 high tech jobs in New York City.
