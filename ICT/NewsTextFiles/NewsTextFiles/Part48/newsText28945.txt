
Sheryl and Shannon Baird hadn’t shared a last name until Monday. That’s when they became Jackson County’s first legally-wed same-sex couple.

The Bairds had their ceremony in front of a fountain right across the street from the county offices.

Southern Oregon residents are showing their support for same-sex marriage — including clergy members who are offering to officiate.

Sheryl and Shannon say it’s a special thing to have their union legally recognized in their home state.

“That’s all we were wanting,” Sheryl said.

“Nothing more, nothing extra. Just equal. Go Oregon,” Shannon added.
