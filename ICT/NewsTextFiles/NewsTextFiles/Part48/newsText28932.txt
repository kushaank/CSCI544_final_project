
AUBURN, Wash.--( BUSINESS WIRE )--The Muckleshoot Indian Tribe has joined with the Affiliated Tribes of        Northwest Indians (ATNI) in calling on the United States Food and Drug        Administration to deny any application for the introduction of        genetically engineered salmon into the United States until a full        Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and further scientific review is        completed and formal consultation with Northwest Treaty Tribes        undertaken.

AquaBounty, a large Boston-based biotechnology company, has proposed to        produce genetically engineered salmon eggs in Canadian waters, ship them        to Panama where the engineered salmon would be raised to maturity in        inland tanks, then slaughtered and processed in Panama and shipped to        the United States for human consumption.

According to federal guidelines, not only would the genetic engineering        process and resultant salmon be owned by a corporation, but the fish        would not be labeled as genetically modified so consumers wouldnâ€™t know        if they are buying it.

Northwest Tribes share a number of serious concerns about genetically        engineered salmon, including the possibility of escape into the wild        habitat and competing with wild salmon for food and rearing locations,        or inbreeding with wild salmon which could result in the destruction of        the species upon which all Indian people of the Pacific Northwest        depend. Studies have not ruled out those possible impacts.

In opposing FDA approval, the Muckleshoot Tribe and ATNI cite the        precautionary principle, which states that habitat modification should        not be undertaken until the full impacts are known and the natural and        human environments are protected - and that the burden of proof that it        is not harmful falls upon those proposing the action.
