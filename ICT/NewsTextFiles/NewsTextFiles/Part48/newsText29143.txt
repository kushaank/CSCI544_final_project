Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick refused to endorse Hillary Clinton this morning on CNN, and called the notion that she's inevitable "off putting to the average voter."

The CNN host asked, "When you look at 2016, is this Hillary all the way, do you think?"

"Well, I don't know," said Governor Patrick. "I guess I worry a little bit. She's an enormously capable candidate and leader, but I do worry about the inevitability thing, because I think it's off putting to the average voter. And I think that was an element of her campaign the last time. ... As an enthusiastic democrat, I just hope that the people around her pay attention to that this time around."

The CNN host followed-up, "Do you consider yourself a Hillary Clinton Democrat?"

"Is there such a thing?"

"Or a Joe Biden Democrat?"

"You mean, am I supporting somebody?" said Patrick. "I haven't endorsed. I probably won't. I certainly haven't been asked."

Patrick, a Democrat, has been considered a possible future Democratic presidential contender.
