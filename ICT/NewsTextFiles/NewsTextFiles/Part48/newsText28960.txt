
So, my kid went in for dental surgery today. Nothing super-drastic, but since he's two he needed anesthesia.  Of course I brought along something to read in the waiting room: the Persian epic Shahnameh (the Book of Kings), composed by the great poet Ferdowsi.  Except I got up at 4:30 this morning, and the wife was going crazy with worry next to me.  So instead we picked up a Glamour from the table and passed a happy forty-five minutes mocking the models together.

Who comes up with the crap that passes for fashion?  About half those women had "tousled" hairdos that reminded me of There's Something About Mary.  And half were got up in this bizarre mishmash of clothes that didn't go together at all, accented by equally unfortunate heaps of gold jewelry.  With considerable overlap between the halves.  One was wearing what looked like a bellhop's jacket over a skimpy tube top, with about three pounds of tacky bling.  The combined effect was something like "crack whore dressed in random stuff she got from the donations box at the Beverly Hills homeless shelter."  Except, according to the captions, these outfits were outrageously expensive, some of them totaling several thousand.

Does anybody happen to know what the point of all this is?  The getups are spectacularly ugly--I assume gay fashion designers are to blame.  They look too uncomfortable for women to inflict on their own sex, and men who find women attractive wouldn't go to such lengths to make them look ugly.  And they're way too pricey for your average magazine reader to actually wear, even if she's sniffed enough glue to make them look good.

Anyway, we were interrupted by the dental surgeon, who came out to tell us the surgery went fine, and noticed the Shahnameh lying closed on my lap.  He was Persian, so he was very pleased to see it, and very gracious about the fact that I'd been neglecting his culture's masterpiece in favor of bad-fashion smut.  The End.

Fashion is stupid and often borders on frank misogyny.

I try to give fashion designers the benefit of the doubt by thinking that the stuff you see in magazines and on the runway is really just a type of art, not stuff you're actually supposed to wear. It's not a type of art I appreciate or understand, however; My fashion begins and ends at Target.

ACK!

Don't try to confuse the issue with half-truths and gorilla dust!

High fashion is ugly and stupid, but if you think the stuff young women are wearing out and about when it's sunny oh, right about now isn't fantastic then you are as gay as the men who designed those awful dresses.

Actually, I would probably think differently if I had a 16-year-old daughter, nonetheless.

We need more accessible fashion and better fashion education. The crap people wear outside of their homes today is shameful. Stretch pants and a t-shirt are not "going out" clothes. They are "give up on life" clothes.

"Capitalism ho!"

We all know you don't understand fashion, Elok, Lori, and HC. We saw the pictures.

It's kind of sad that they get their jollies mocking an industry they neither understand or appreciate.

Indexed and cross-referenced, I presume.

Among the poets we are ****.

He's seen our Polymeet pictures, when I'm pretty sure none of us were trying.  Aside from that, I don't know.

We all know you'd have liked to be one of those fashion designers.  TIME TO BREAK OUT THE SHORTS!

I sort of vaguely recall Al posting a picture of himself in an ugly pink shirt and boat shoes.

To be fair, I'm almost never trying. I probably wore the same thing to the Polymeet that I'm wearing at work today. At my friend's wedding in January, I meant to dress up but discovered half an hour before the wedding that the dress pants I'd brought along had a broken zipper that couldn't easily be fixed. I wore jeans.

frank misogyny.

but Frank is a good guy!  He's not one of these fashion nazis!

There's a strong argument to be made for exploitation at least, if not outright misogyny.  These magazines have pages and pages dedicated to convincing women that they need to spend outrageous amounts of cash on grotesquely impractical clothing, then spend an hour every morning putting on complex combinations of makeup, or they'll look ugly or dowdy.

and those poor women!  They need big strong men, who know about the evils of fashion, to save them!

They're being misogynized and don't even know it!

Nobody makes you buy that ****.

Trying to convince you to buy a product isn't exploitation unless you're a ****ing retard with a dumb definition of exploitation--oh wait, you are.

You are the one using the word "exploitation", not me.

I just hate ads.  They annoy me.  They don't exploit me.  Ban them.

I'm sure there are fine lines, shades of grey, etc., but in general, if you're knowingly exploiting someone's fears to sell them something you know they won't need, like, or have a legitimate use for, you're behaving immorally.  You're right that much of advertising does this, but you can sell someone, say, a ridiculously huge TV with the expectation that they will enjoy having flashy lights blasted at them from an enormous surface.  Ditto for boats or guns or fancy food.  You have to be either stupid or lying to yourself on a grand scale if you think anyone should pay $3000 for an ugly, impractical handbag that will be declared out of style in six months.

People are taking the piss out of you everyday. They butt into your life, take a cheap shot at you and then disappear. They leer at you from tall buildings and make you feel small. They make flippant comments from buses that imply you’re not sexy enough and that all the fun is happening somewhere else. They are on TV making your girlfriend feel inadequate. They have access to the most sophisticated technology the world has ever seen and they bully you with it. They are The Advertisers and they are laughing at you.

You, however, are forbidden to touch them. Trademarks, intellectual property rights and copyright law mean advertisers can say what they like wherever they like with total impunity.

**** that. Any advert in a public space that gives you no choice whether you see it or not is yours. It’s yours to take, re-arrange and re-use. You can do whatever you like with it. Asking for permission is like asking to keep a rock someone just threw at your head.

You owe the companies nothing. Less than nothing, you especially don’t owe them any courtesy. They owe you. They have re-arranged the world to put themselves in front of you. They never asked for your permission, don’t even start asking for theirs.
