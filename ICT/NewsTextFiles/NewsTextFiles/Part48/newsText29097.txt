
San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro speaks Jan. 23 about President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. Obama is reportedly considering nominating San Antonio’s mayor to be housing secretary.

If Castro is nominated to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development and is confirmed by the Senate, he would become one of the highest-ranking Hispanic officials in the Obama administration.

Serving in Obama’s Cabinet would help broaden Castro’s experience beyond local politics.

HUD plays a key role in the “Promise Zone” initiative, a federal effort to revitalize high-poverty communities by increasing economic activity, improving educational opportunities and leveraging private capital. San Antonio was among the first cities that received a grant for the program from the administration.
