FREEPORT, Maine – The first non-family member to lead L.L. Bean is planning to step down in 2016 after more than a decade as CEO, saying the Maine-based retailer is positioned for future growth.

Chris McCormick, president and CEO, told employees in a memo that he’s giving early notice so there can be a smooth transition. L.L. Bean opened a store at the Freehold Raceway Mall last September.

During his tenure, McCormick helped to transform the 102-year-old outdoors retailer from a catalog company into a multi-channel retailer that does most of its business online. He’s also sped up the opening of retail stores, with 19 stores now in operation and plans to open three more this year.

The privately held retailer is coming off its fourth year of consecutive growth.

McCormick has been with L.L. Bean for 31 years, including 13 as president and CEO. He succeeded Leon Gorman, grandson of founder L.L. Bean. The current chairman is Bean’s great-grandson Shawn Gorman.

McCormick said he was grateful that the family entrusted him with the company’s operations.

With more than $1.5 billion in sales last year, the company is poised for growth. The company announced in March that it’s pumping an additional $100 million into its website, retail expansion and business systems.

As for his own future, McCormick said he’s not sure what he’ll do next, but he doesn’t intend to retire: “There are other markets out there. There are other people to meet,” he said.

The company’s recent fortunes have tracked closely with booming sales of the L.L. Bean hunting shoe. The company continues to add workers at a Maine production plant to keep up with demand.

June Strohmeyer, a Denver resident visiting the flagship store for the first time, said she Monday that appreciates L.L. Bean’s timeless style, customer service and durability.

And she’s willing to pay for it.
