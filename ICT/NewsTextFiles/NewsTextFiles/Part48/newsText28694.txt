
Montgomery, Ala.

The owner of an abortion clinic in Alabama's capital city testified Monday that for the 36 years she's been in business, she has always used out-of-town doctors who wouldn't be able to admit patients to local hospitals as required under a new state law.

June Ayers, the owner of Montgomery's Reproductive Health Services, was the first witness in the trial of a lawsuit that she and others filed over the law that requires clinics to use doctors who have approval to admit patients to nearby hospitals in case of complications.

Her clinic and clinics in Mobile and Birmingham would have to close if the law is enforced, officials have said.

Mississippi, Wisconsin and Texas have laws similar to Alabama, but Texas is the only state where the law is being enforced.
