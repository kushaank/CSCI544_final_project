
Guatemala City, May 19 (EFE).- The government of President Otto Perez Molina officially confirmed Monday the creation of an air task force, whose mission will be to fight drug trafficking in Guatemala.

The force, to be known by the acronym FIAAT, will originally have a 5-year span of operation.

The purpose of the unit, integrated by the Interior and Defense Ministries, is to intercept drug shipments by air, while also providing support for ground operations in the seizure and destruction of drug crops, commercial operations and chemical-precursor trafficking, among others.

FIAAT will also provide humanitarian aid in cases of natural disasters or public tragedies that occur in Guatemala.

The Central American country, authorities say, is used as a bridge and warehouse for international cartels shipping drugs from South America to the United States.

Last October the United States donated six helicopters along with air navigation instruments to Guatemala as part of its cooperation in the war on drugs.
