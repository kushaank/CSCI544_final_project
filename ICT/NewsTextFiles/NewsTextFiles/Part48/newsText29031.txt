A body of a 30-year-old man was recovered Sunday afternoon at Lake Pleasant by divers with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office and Phoenix police.

Divers found the body of Christopher James Starcovic at about 2 p.m. in about three feet of water in Humbug Cove at Lake Pleasant, located just northwest of Phoenix in Lake Pleasant National Park, said MCSO spokesman Joaquin Enriquez.

Enriquez said Starcovic was last seen on a 27-foot cabin cruiser boat about 3 a.m. that was about 50 yards off shore.

He was with three other adults, including one family member.

Starcovic, who did not know how to swim, fell in the water, Enriquez said. The MCSO Lake Patrol Dive Team and the Phoenix Police Dive Team were called at approximately 8 a.m. to conduct an underwater search of the area.

Preliminary information on the investigation indicates that Starcovic was extremely intoxicated, Enriquez said.
