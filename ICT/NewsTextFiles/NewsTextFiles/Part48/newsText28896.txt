WASHINGTON — The White House is threatening a veto of the House version of a $601 billion defense bill over election-year moves to spare weapons systems and popular programs in the face of limited budgets.

In a statement on Monday, the Obama administration said that if the bill in its current form impedes the Pentagon from directing scarce resources to the military, senior advisers would recommend that the president veto the measure.

The White House also complained about the bills limits on the presidents ability to transfer terror suspects being held at the U.S. facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

The House is expected to debate and vote on the bill this week. The Senate Armed Services Committee is beginning its work on its version. The two measures will have to be reconciled.
