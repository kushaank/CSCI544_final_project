
Police in Mississippi say a judge has kept bond at $100,000 for a conservative Mississippi blogger who is accused of photographing the bedridden wife of Republican U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran without permission.

Madison Assistant Chief Robert Sanders says the judge scheduled a preliminary hearing Thursday for 28-year-old Clayton Kelly.

Kelly was arrested late Friday on a charge of exploiting a vulnerable adult. He’s accused of using an image of Cochran’s wife in an online video.

State Sen. Chris McDaniel is challenging the six-term senator in a GOP primary. McDaniel says he does not have any ties to Kelly.

Spokesmen for both campaigns say they learned about the video April 26.
