
As they say, politics ain’t beanbag. But there are still times when political rhetoric goes way over the line. Witness Karl Rove, the new Lee Atwater.

We’ve seen this tactic before, way back in the 2000 South Carolina GOP primary, when rumors circulated that John McCain had spent so much time as a Vietnamese prisoner of war that he might be “mentally unstable.” And if you don’t believe the Bush campaign, led by Rove, was responsible for that smear, ask McCain.

And while Clinton will, indeed, be 69 in November 2016, she will actually be eight months younger than Ronald Reagan was when he was elected president. Republicans never dismissed him as an old fart, too old to lead the country.

In the end, whatever decision Clinton ultimately makes will be her own. Karl Rove will have nothing to do with it.
