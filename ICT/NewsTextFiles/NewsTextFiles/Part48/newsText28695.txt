
Researchers studying children six months of age to seven years old found that not getting enough sleep over the long term is a strong risk factor of obesity in children. Childhood obesity sets the stage for other lifestyle-related conditions such as heart disease and diabetes in later life.

In a study involving more than 1,000 children, the researchers collected annual data measuring the children’s physical health and sleep patterns, including their nap time. Adequate sleep was defined by age with less than 12 hours per day considered inadequate for children six months to two years old; 10 hours per day was considered necessary for children ages three and four and less than nine hours was insufficient for children five to seven years old. At age seven, the children’s height, weight, abdominal fat, lean body mass, waist circumference, and hip circumference were measured.
