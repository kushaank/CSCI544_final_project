
Freedom to Marry  is the campaign to win marriage nationwide. We are pursuing our  Roadmap to Victory  by working to win the freedom to marry in more states, grow the national majority for marriage, and end federal marriage discrimination. We partner with individuals and organizations across the country to end the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage and the protections, responsibilities, and commitment that marriage brings.
