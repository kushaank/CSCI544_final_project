Washington, D.C. â€” Effective today, the Mexican government has implemented its final rule to allow U.S. fresh potatoes to enter all of Mexico. This action is part of a bi-lateral agreement that facilitates trade in fresh potatoes between the two countries.

The National Potato Council and U.S. Potato Board support the trade agreement, as it will benefit potato growers in Mexico and the U.S., as well as the processing industries and consumers in both countries.

Per capita potato consumption in Mexico is lower than in the U.S., so there is room for this market to grow. The USPB will conduct market development programs in Mexico that will be designed to increase consumption of all potatoes in Mexico.
