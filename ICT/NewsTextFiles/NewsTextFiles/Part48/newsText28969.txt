The U.S. will give nearly $300 million in humanitarian aid to South Sudan, White House officials said Monday.

The  money, including $50 million from the U.S. Emergency Refugee and  Migration Assistance Fund, will be formally pledged Tuesday at a  conference in Oslo, Norway.

South Sudan is the worldâ€™s youngest nation, having just been formed  in 2011. Over the past six months, the country has been rocked by  violence as fighting continues between government troops and forces  loyal to rebel leader Riek Machar.

After the new round of assistance is delivered, the U.S. will have  given $430 million in humanitarian aid to South Sudan, according to the White House .
