
SUNBURY (AP) ï¿½ A northeastern Pennsylvania judge has refused to take the death penalty off the table in the case of a woman charged along with her newlywed husband with luring a Pennsylvania man through Craigslist and killing him.

Investigators said that last November she stabbed 42-year-old Troy LaFerrara about 20 times in her parked car as husband Elytte Barbour held a cord tight against his neck from the back seat and then dumped his body in an alley.

They have pleaded not guilty. Both face the death penalty.
