
Today is the day we find out if marriage equality has finally come to Oregon.

Same-sex marriages in Oregon could begin as soon as Monday afternoon, depending on a judge's ruling. U.S. District Judge Michael McShane said he'll issue his ruling at noon Pacific time on a constitutional challenge to the state's gay-marriage ban. Officials in Oregon's largest county, Multnomah, say they'll begin issuing marriage licenses immediately if his ruling allows it. McShane hasn't signaled how he'll rule, but the state refused to mount a defense of the voter-approved ban, and both sides asked that it be found unconstitutional.
