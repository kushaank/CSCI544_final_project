
A pet dog alerted a family to a fire in their Town of Jackson home early Monday, and the four people inside were able to escape the blaze.

The fire in the 4700 block of Jackson Drive was reported just after 12:30 a.m. Monday, according to the Washington County Sheriff's Office . The first deputy to arrive found the garage portion of the two-story home was engulfed in flames.

Firefighters controlled the blaze quickly and prevented it from spreading to the rest of the residence. The garage was a total loss, as was a small room attached to the garage, and the rest of the house sustained smoke damage.

The Jackson Fire Department responded to the fire and was assisted by the Fillmore, Germantown, Newburg, Richfield and Slinger fire departments. The cause remains under investigation by the Washington County Sheriff's Office.

There were no working smoke detectors in the house, authorities said. The American Red Cross assisted the family.
