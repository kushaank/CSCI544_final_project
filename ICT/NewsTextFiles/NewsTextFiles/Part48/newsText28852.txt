There was a desperate 911 call to police from Jacqueline Gomez's prom date. And police say they found alcohol and prescription pain killers in the Houston, Texas, hotel room where she died. But a homicide investigation is ongoing.

Gomez, 18, was found dead Saturday morning at the Hyatt in north Houston, Texas, after the Friday night prom held by the MacArthur High School, the USAToday is reporting.

"She then stayed overnight in the hotel. In the morning hours, the person that was with her found her deceased in her bed. We are not sure at this hour what the cause of death is," Det. Mike Miller, with the Houston Police Department Homicide Division, told the newspaper.

Police said the girl's boyfriend who had called 911 was taken in for questioning about what happened.

"He was there. He knows everything, so we're just continually wanting to find out what happened and everything," said Miller. "We have no reason to believe he contributed to her death."

However, the homicide investigation is continuing and no cause of death has been determined in the case.

Meanwhile, the MacArthur senior's friends and family are struggling to cope with her loss, according to media reports. Friends and family are telling local station KHOU they want answers to know what exactly happened to her and why.
