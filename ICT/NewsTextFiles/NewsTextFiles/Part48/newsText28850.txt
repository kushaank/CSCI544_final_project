
SUTHERLIN, Oregon — The remains of a 74-year-old Southern Oregon man who vanished while hiking nearly two years ago have been found.

The Douglas County sheriff's office says a landowner found the skeletal remains Sunday in a ravine about a mile and a half northwest of Royce Paul Cratty's home near Sutherlin.

His wife had dropped him off west of Sutherlin, and a forest worker was the last person to see him.

The sheriff's department says an extensive search at the time turned up no trace of Cratty, but the ravine wasn't searched.

Deputies say the remains and personal effects led to a positive identification. Foul play isn't suspected.
