
WASHINGTON — Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Dallas, said again this afternoon that he is not angling for the Speaker’s gavel in the fall, should a contest develop either to replace or oust Speaker John Boehner. But as he said previously this month, he’s not ruling such a race out, either.

He said many voters are disaffected with Washington and with what they see as big business’s out-sized influence over policy. He said the GOP ought to be in favor of free enterprise generally and less responsive to particular business interests.

“I think it is important how the conservative movement thinks about this, and how it acts on it. There is a distinction between business interests and free enterprise interests. They can overlap but they are not identical,” he said.

Hensarling, like chairmen of the House Financial Services Committee before him, is a big recipient of campaign contributions from large business and banking interests. In 2013-14, PACs representing the insurance, commercial banking, and securities and investment industries contributed nearly $450,000, with individuals tied to those industries contributing more than $170,000, according to tallies maintained by opensecrets.org.
