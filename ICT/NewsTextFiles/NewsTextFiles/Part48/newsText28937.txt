
Rajya Sabha member Renuka Chowdary on Monday lashed out at senior party leaders from Telangana for trying to shift the blame on partyâ€™s debacle in the region on the AICC chief Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi.

At a press conference here, Ms. Chowdary sought to know why the Telangana Congress leaders failed to take advantage of the situation after Ms. Gandhi enabled division of the State. She sought to know how the party fared badly if the seniors had wholeheartedly worked for the victory.

She alleged that some seniors had misled Ms. Gandhi in believing that if the State was divided, Congress would reap the benefit in Telangana. The results have proven beyond that the leaders had completely misguided her. The Rajya Sabha member took exception to the attempts by certain leaders to point a finger at the party president and the vice-president for the poll debacle.
