
A super PAC supporting the re-election of Mississippi incumbent Thad Cochran is hitting the senator’s Republican primary opponent for being similar to Todd Akin — the Republican from Missouri who lost his Senate race in 2010 after his infamous “legitimate rape” comment.

A source provided The Daily Caller a copy of the mailer that is being sent out by the Mississippi Conservatives PAC. The mailer, when opened, plays 35-seconds worth of provocative comments made by state Sen. Chris McDaniel when he hosted a radio show.

McDaniel has the support of conservative groups who have been arguing that Cochran is not sufficiently conservative.

The Hill reported that the super-PAC — with ties to former Gov. Haley Barbour — plans to spend $150,000 on sending the mailers to voters across the state.

It hits McDaniel for comments joking about the word “mamacita” and talking about a candidate “basically using her boobies” to win votes.

During the 2012 campaign in Missouri, Akin told a news station that “the female body has ways to try to shut the whole thing down” if a “legitimate rape” occurs. That prompted outrage and condemnation from both sides of the political aisle.

The mailer comes after a strange weekend of events in Mississippi: a blogger who supports McDaniel was arrested after being accused of breaking into the nursing home where Cochran’s wife lives and photographing the senator’s wife.

The primary is set to take place June 3.
