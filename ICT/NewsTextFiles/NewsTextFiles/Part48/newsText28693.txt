
The owner of an abortion clinic in Alabama's capital city has testified that for the 36 years she's been in business, she has always used out-of-town doctors who wouldn't be able to admit patients to local hospitals as required under a new state law.

June Ayers, the owner of Reproductive Health Services, was the first witness Monday in the trial of a lawsuit she and others filed over the law requiring clinics to use doctors who have approval to admit patients in case of complications. She and owners of clinics in Mobile and Birmingham say they will have to close if the law is enforced.

Ayers testified her traveling physicians wouldn't qualify for admitting privileges because they don't live in the Montgomery area and would not have the required number of hospital admissions.
