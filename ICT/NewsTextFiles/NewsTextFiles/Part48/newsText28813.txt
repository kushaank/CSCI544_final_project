JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- A 47-year-old woman pleaded guilty to sending letters to Senators Marco Rubio and Bill Nelson in June of 2011, threatening their lives.

Kathryn Cohen Allen, of Jasper, faces a maximum penalty of ten years in federal prison and a fine of $500,000.

Allen allegedly mailed threatening letters containing a white powdery substance to the offices of United States Senators Marco Rubio and Bill Nelson, according to court documents. Both offices were evacuated as a result.

Testing of the substance revealed it was not hazardous.

Allen allegedly admitted that sending the letters in attempt to frame a neighbor she believed was in an interracial relationship. Allen was implicated when her handwriting allegedly matched two of the letters.
