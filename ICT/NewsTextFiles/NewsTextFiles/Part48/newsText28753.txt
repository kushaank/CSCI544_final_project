
PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - Jubilant couples are rushing to the altar after a federal judge struck down Oregon's ban on same-sex marriage.

The ruling from Judge Michael McShane came shortly after noon. Couples across the state quickly started getting marriage licenses and, in some cases, going through with the ceremony.

In Portland, some couples lined up for their licenses more than four hours before McShane released his opinion in Eugene.

Kelly and Patty Reagan took the day off work to get married, their kids along with them.

Kelly Reagan says Monday's ruling is the final validation - "the official stamp."

In northeast Portland, leaders from the group Oregon United for Marriage read McShane's opinion aloud to thrilled supporters.

In Eugene, couples gathered at a downtown restaurant to celebrate and tie the knot.
