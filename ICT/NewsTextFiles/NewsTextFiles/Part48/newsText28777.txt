
Oregon same-sex marriage advocates rejoice as U.S. District Court Judge Michael McShane rules the state's 10-year-old ban on gay marriage unconstitutional. Hundreds of couples are expected to get married today at the Melody Ballroom in Southeast Ballroom. Click through for more images related to Monday's historic ruling.

As couples filed into the Melody Ballroom, Stu Rasmussen sat ready to do something he's waited a while to do.

Rasmussen, the mayor of Silverton, was poised to perform one of the first legal same-sex marriages in Oregon.

I found the scene particularly poignant because I've known the trans-gendered Rasmussen for many years. He's not only an astute and effective politician â€” full disclosure: yes, he's a friend of mine â€” but he's one of Silverton's best-known small business operators.

To see him getting ready to marry revelers at the Melody Ballroom Monday drove home just what a historic day we've had.
