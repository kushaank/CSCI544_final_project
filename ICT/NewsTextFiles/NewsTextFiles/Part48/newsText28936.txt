
HONOLULU (AP) - One of the most vocal opponents in the Democratic party of legalizing same-sex marriage will have opposition in the primary election.

Oahu Democrats on Sunday decided to let a University of Hawaii-West Oahu instructor challenge state Rep. Sharon Har, who was one of 13 Democrats to vote against legalizing same-sex marriage.

Nicole Ferguson needed permission from Oahu Democrats since she recent moved to the district and is still registered to vote in another House district.

Another announced primary opponent for Har will be Michael Golojuch Jr., who is chairman of the party's Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgendered Caucus.

Har says she was expecting challenges in the Aug. 9 primary. She tells the Honolulu Star-Advertiser in a text message that contested races are the spirit of democracy.
