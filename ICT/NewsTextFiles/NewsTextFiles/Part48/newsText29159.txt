
President Barack Obama is speaking with introspection about constraints on his power at home and abroad, as mid-term election inertia stifles Washington and his hopes of major legislative wins this year.

Early skirmishes of the 2016 presidential campaign â€“- and the unquenchable media obsession with all things Clinton -- are already forcing Obama to share the political stage.

When power ebbs at home, second term presidents often flex muscle abroad.

But no overseas playground awaits Obama: in Asia, Europe and the Middle East, US dominance is under siege, fueling a Republican narrative that the president fires blanks and lacks a coherent foreign policy doctrine.

In friendly company, Obama's frustration is beginning to show.

"I've got a drawer full of things that we know would create jobs, help our middle class, boost incomes, make us more competitive," Obama told wealthy New York Democrats.

"But we have a party on the other side that has been captured by an ideology that says no to anything."

The president's gloom is partly self-inflicted.

Obama botched the rollout of his health care law and saw his approval ratings -- and consequent power to persuade in mid-term polls eroded.

His administration is now struggling to contain a scandal after 40 military veterans died while waiting for treatment at a Phoenix medical facility.
