
ROCHESTER, N.Y. –  A 25-year-old woman has been sentenced to up to four years in prison for lying on firearm transaction documents when she bought guns used by a man to kill two New York volunteer firefighters on Christmas Eve 2012.

Dawn Nguyen (when) of the town of Greece drew the maximum term of 1 1/3 to four years in state prison when she was sentenced Monday in Rochester.

She was convicted last month of falsifying business records when she filled out forms to buy a rifle and shotgun in 2010 for her neighbor William Spengler Jr.

Spengler was prohibited from owning weapons because of his felony record for killing his grandmother.

He set fire to his home in Webster on Dec. 24, 2012, and used the guns to shoot four firefighters, two fatally, before committing suicide.
