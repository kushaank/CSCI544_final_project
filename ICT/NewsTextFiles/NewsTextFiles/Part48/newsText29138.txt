
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), battling to maintain control of the Senate, slightly edged out its Republican counterpart in April fundraising.

The DSCC brought in $6.3 million and finished the month with a total of $25 million in the bank. Their total fundraising for the cycle is $80.4 million.

The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) brought in $6.04 million in the same month and has $21.9 million in the bank, bringing their total fundraising this cycle to $59.2 million. Neither group has any debt.

Echoing a frequent refrain from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nev., DSCC Executive Director Guy Cecil said in a statement that Republican Senate candidates are "bought and paid for" by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch.

"The Kochs are continuing their unprecedented onslaught of false attack ads aimed at boosting these Republicans, but Democrats are prepared to counter their millions with the support of thousands of generous donors across the country and a strong grassroots network determined to fight back," Cecil said.

The Democrats' House arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), raised $7.1 million in April, giving them $43.5 million in the bank. The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) has yet to release its numbers but in March, the DCCC outraised the NRCC by $900,000 and had $9 million more on hand.

President Obama is set to attend his third DCCC fundraiser of the year Monday evening at a private residence in Maryland. He has attended 21 Democratic fundraisers already in 2014, including 13 for the Democratic National Committee, three for the DSCC, two joint events for the DSCC and DCCC, and one for the Democratic Governors' Association, according to CBS News White House Correspondent Mark Knoller.
