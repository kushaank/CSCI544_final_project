
Sarah Palin is mocking Democrats for protesting the recent focus on Hillary Clinton’s health, saying she had faced similar scrutiny over whether she gave birth to her son, Trig.

“Thank goodness liberals are consistent in refusing to apply double standards, thanks to their disdain for hypocrisy — so they’ll come through once again!” Palin wrote in a sarcastic Facebook post published Monday.

In the post, Palin linked to a Wall Street Journal article about the right defending the issue — first raised by Karl Rove — of Clinton’s health and the possibility she endured brain trauma after suffering a blood clot in 2012.

“Hey! Hillary’s brain is off-limits! Leave her health records alone! Democrats are right — scouring records of a female candidate is just politics of personal destruction, and for the media to engage in it would be unfair, unethical, and absolutely UNPRECEDENTED,” wrote Palin, the GOP’s 2008 vice presidential nominee.
