PORTLAND, Maine   — Police say a home invasion suspect who'd been hiding in the woods for several days had two conditions for giving up: chocolate milk, and Mountain Dew.

Police say 30-year-old Michael Crockett Jr. of Buxton was thirsty and hungry — and covered with mosquito bites and ticks — when he surrendered Sunday night.

Police say Crockett is one of three people suspected of breaking into a Buxton home and assaulting and tying up the 60-year-old woman occupant last month. Two others were already arrested.
