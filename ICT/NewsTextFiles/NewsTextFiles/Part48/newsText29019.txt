
NEW YORK (AP) â€” Former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney is calling for the resignation of a New Hampshire police commissioner who used a racial slur in describing President Barack Obama.

Romney said in a statement, "The vile epithet used and confirmed by the commissioner has no place in our community: He should apologize and resign."

The former Massachusetts governor joins some political leaders and residents in the predominantly white New Hampshire town of Wolfeboro in calling for the resignation of Robert Copeland.

A resident said she overheard the 82-year-old Copeland use a slur a restaurant in March and wrote to the town manager. Copeland, in an email to her, acknowledged using the slur in referring to the president and said he will not apologize.

Officials say resignation is the only way to get Copeland out of office before his three-year term expires.
