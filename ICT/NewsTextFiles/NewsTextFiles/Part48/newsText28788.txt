
Progressive HR leaders now realize that if they just send out the regular COBRA notices, they won’t be doing right by their employees.

A small group of employers have overhauled their employee communications in response to health reform, urging recently laid-off workers to enroll in Covered California rather than in COBRA.

The regulators appear to agree. On May 15, Covered California created a special enrollment period for people on COBRA, allowing them to enroll in an exchange plan through July 15th, 2014. But, while regulators now tout the advantages of exchange plans, employers have some catching up to do.

Nearly all employers still send departing workers a notification explaining how to continue their healthcare coverage using COBRA. These notices can be very confusing, and often don’t teach them how to weigh COBRA against cheaper options on the exchange. “Progressive HR leaders now realize that if they just send out the regular COBRA notices, they won’t be doing right by their employees,” said Poger.
