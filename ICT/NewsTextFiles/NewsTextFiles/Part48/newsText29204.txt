
A senior House Democrat and civil rights leader said Monday he does not support Michael Boggs’ nomination to a U.S. district court in Georgia.

Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), dispelled reports that he was lobbying for Boggs, saying that President Barack Obama’s nominee stands in “direct opposition” to Lewis’s civil rights work.

The Boggs nomination is encountering significant trouble after several Senate Democrats, including Majority Leader Harry Reid, have openly questioned whether they could support him. They’re upset about Boggs’ tenure in the Georgia legislature, where he gained a conservative voting record on gay rights, abortion and support of the Confederate flag.

It’s unusual for a House member to weigh in so publicly on a judicial nomination. But Lewis, a civil rights icon from Georgia, is in the middle of the debate after Reid and Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said they would seek his counsel before deciding how to proceed.

The spotlight on Lewis only intensified after Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) indicated on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday that Lewis apporved of Boggs’ nomination.

That prompted a furious reaction from Rep. David Scott, a fellow African American Democrat from Georgia, who took to Twitter on Monday to say that his colleague would be a “turncoat” if he supported Boggs.

Lewis said on Monday he was not advocating for Boggs in conversations with senators.

The Congressional Black Caucus, where Lewis is a prominent leader, expressed support last week for Reid’s comments opposing the nomination.
