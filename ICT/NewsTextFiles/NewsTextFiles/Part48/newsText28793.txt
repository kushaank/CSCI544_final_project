
SULLIVAN COUNTY, Indiana (May 19, 2014) – Two carnival workers are facing animal neglect charges after a traffic stop this afternoon just south of Terre Haute, Indiana.

An Indiana State Trooper stopped a Ford pickup truck hauling a homemade enclosed trailer along U.S. 41 near State Road 54 in Sullivan County for a routine inspection of the truck, trailer and cargo.

In the trailer the Trooper found two miniature horses, one male and one female.  Both animals appeared emaciated and in poor health.  There wasn’t food or water in the trailer, which also had insufficient air flow for the animals.

Humane Society workers were called to the scene and took custody of the horses, which were taken to the Sullivan County Animal Hospital for care.

Several traffic citations were issued, including not having a log book and overloaded trailer tires.  Both men are carnival workers and were employed by Modern Midways Carnival out of Miami, Florida.  The men were making their way from Chadsworth, Georgia to Chicago, Illinois.

Both men were lodged at the Sullivan County Jail on the animal neglect charges and the vehicle and trailer were impounded.
