University of Iowa President Sally Mason spoke to the Board or Regents today in Urbandale about her plans to deal with sexual assault on campus.  She proposed a six-point plan to combat sexual assault.

University of Iowa President Sally Mason is the fifth-highest-earning college president in the country, according to a study by the Chronicle of Higher Education.

Mason, the magazine said, made $1.14 million in 2013, including deferred payment. Her base salary is $493,272. She received a one-time retention bonus in November for staying with UI for five years.

State records show Mason made $972,605 in the 12 months that ended June 30. A UI spokesman could not be reached late Sunday to explain the approximately $167,395 difference between state salary records and the Chronicle’s survey.

According to the study’s findings, the number of public college presidents earning greater than $1 million more than doubled in the 2012-13 fiscal year from the year before. Nine college presidents earned more than $1 million in total compensation in 2013, compared with just four in 2012, the survey found.

Public college presidents first exceeded the $1 million total compensation mark in 2004, according to the report.

Gordon Gee topped the list, earning  $6.06 million as the head of Ohio State University. Gee resigned that post last year after making comments about Roman Catholics, the University of Notre Dame and Southeastern Conference schools. He is now president of West Virginia University.

Also of note, former UI President Mary Sue Coleman, a Grinnell College alumna and retiring University of Michigan at Ann Arbor president, was No. 9 on the list with about $1 million in earnings, including a base pay of $603,357, bonus pay of $200,000 and $234,000 in deferred and retirement pay.

The study took into account base salary, bonuses, retirement, severance and deferred pay — an incentive offered to presidents who stay in their positions for an agreed-upon period of time.

Four of the college presidents on the top 10 list have retired. Two others have accepted positions at other universities.
