
History channel and October Films have secured the exclusive rights to what is believed to be the site of the shipwreck of Columbus’ flagship, the Santa Maria.

History is sponsoring an expedition to the site, which will be made into a television event to premiere at a later date.

More than five centuries after Columbus’ flagship was wrecked in the Caribbean, an archaeological team led by maritime investigator Barry Clifford believes they have located the famous vessel’s long lost remains off the coast of Haiti. Clifford is planning to carry out further investigations in the coming months to prove that the ship they found is the Santa Maria.

The Santa Maria was built in the second half of the 15th century and was used in 1492 by Columbus as he sailed across the Atlantic in search of a new western route to Asia. On Christmas Eve in 1492, a cabin boy, after the rest of the crew fell asleep, crashed the ship on a coral reef off the northern coast of Haiti. Columbus, who was on board, wrote about the wreck and the aftermath in his journal, but the Santa Maria’s final resting place had been lost through time and has remained a mystery for centuries.
