
OK, you amateur salmon grillers, listen up. Chef John Howie has something to teach you.

Howie is the owner of Seastar restaurants and raw bars in Seattle and Bellevue. Heâ€™s won the last two celebrity chef Copper River salmon cook-offs, most recently beating a pair of James Beard Award finalists for Best Chef Northwest.

Howie, a James Beard semifinalist for national Outstanding Restaurateur in 2012, went up against chefs Jason Franey of Canlis and Ethan Stowell of Staple & Fancy, each nominated multiple times for the region's top culinary honor.

His winning salmon had nothing on it but black Hawaiian sea salt.

â€œLast year I decided I would keep it simple and really show the salmon. Thatâ€™s what I did again this year,â€� Howie said.

He pan-seared the fish, finished it in a small convection oven and served it with a warm English pea puree and a morel mushroom risotto cake.

Stowell cooked his salmon in a pan with peas, morels and ramps. Franey slightly smoked his salmon before grilling it, and served it with a crab dumpling. The judges â€“ Seahawks kicker Steven Hauschka and ex-Mariners slugger Jay Buhner â€“ liked Howieâ€™s preparation best.

The chefs cook-off is an annual affair staged by Alaska Airlines, coinciding with the delivery of the first planeload of Copper River salmon from Cordova, Alaska. At Fridayâ€™s contest, the first fish off the plane was a 48-pound king carried by the pilots down a red carpet.
