Around 5:45 p.m. on May 18, Chesterfield County Police responded to the 7400 block of Hickory Road, east of Route 150/Chippenham Parkway and west of Route 147/North Huguenot Road, for a report of a shooting.

He was transported to VCU Medical Center and is expected to survive his injuries.

The victim's 26-year-old brother surrendered and was taken into police custody, though no charges have been placed at this time.

The victim lives in a trailer home with is family on Hickory Road. His older brother told police he went to check on his younger brother and had brought a pistol for protection because of recent disputes between the two siblings.
