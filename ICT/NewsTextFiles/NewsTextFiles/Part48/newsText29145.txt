
MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Former Wisconsin Gov. Patrick Lucey is being remembered as a great family and religious man who helped Wisconsin thrive during his seven years in office.

Lucey was a hard-nosed Democrat who died a week ago at age 96. He was Wisconsin's governor from 1970 to 1977.

Other current and former Wisconsin governors gathered at his funeral Monday in Milwaukee.

Former Gov. Tommy Thompson, a Republican, credited Lucey with growing the Democratic party into a "tremendous organization, much to my chagrin and all Republicans."

Gov. Scott Walker also attended, along with former Wisconsin governors Martin Schreiber, Scott McCallum and Jim Doyle.

MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A funeral Mass is set for former Wisconsin Gov. Patrick Lucey, a hard-nosed Democrat who died about a week ago at age 96.

The event will be held Monday morning in Milwaukee.

Lucey was elected governor in 1970. He was re-elected in 1974 but he left midway through the term to serve as President Jimmy Carter's ambassador to Mexico.

He also ran for U.S. vice president as an independent in 1980.

His Wisconsin legacy includes his push to merge the University of Wisconsin in Madison with the state college system. The fierce battle ultimately led to the current system of 13 four-year state colleges.

Lucey is also remembered for appointing Shirley Abrahamson to the state Supreme Court in 1976. She became the first woman on the state's high court.
