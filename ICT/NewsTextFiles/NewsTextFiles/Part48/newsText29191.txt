
CHICAGO (REUTERS) - An Illinois man who had tested positive for antibodies to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus in his blood is no longer infectious, state health officials said on Monday.

The case in Illinois was the first direct transmission of the Mers virus on US soil. The two prior cases earlier in the month were both "imported" cases of Mers, brought to the United States by infected travelers from the Middle East, the epicenter of the Mers outbreak.

Florida officials separately said the second patient infected with Mers has now been released from the hospital in Orlando.
