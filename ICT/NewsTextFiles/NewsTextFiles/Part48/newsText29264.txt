
The Alliance Review received three first-place awards in the annual Ohio Associated Press Media Editors contest.

Stephanie Ujhelyi, The Review's city and police reporter, won first place for her breaking news story "Pipe Bomb Arrest."

Judges said of Ujhelyi's effort, "Liked the lede, really pulled me into the story."

The winning story began, "Did a live explosive allegedly discovered beneath an Alliance man's truck carry some kind of Valentine's Day message?"

Shannon Harsh won a first-place award in the category of Best Use of Multimedia for her presentation of the renovated Alliance Family YMCA.

Judges said, "The video tour of the new YMCA gives readers a look inside that they couldn't get from text and pictures alone. Nice use of multimedia."

Chris Schillig was chosen for first place in the Best Columnist category. In that category, finalists are chosen on their overall body of work.

"Schillig is a talented, thoughtful writer who is very often clever without resorting to clich√©s," judges said. "He takes on weighty subject matter, but makes it accessible to the reader. Well done."

In the same category Executive Editor Rob Todor was awarded second place.

Judges said, "Todor uses humor effectively, but still makes a point. He delivers a fun and entertaining read."

The Ohio APME awards were presented Sunday at the organization's annual meeting and banquet in Columbus.
