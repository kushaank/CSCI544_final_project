
ATTICA, N.Y. -- A Wyoming County Assistant District Attorney was fired from his job after a run-in with the law Sunday morning.

The sheriff's office says 33-year-old Marshall Kelly faces charges of assault and criminal trespass after a domestic incident in the Village of Attica.

He's worked as an assistant district attorney out of Wyoming County for more than four years. Wyoming County District Attorney Donald O'Geen says Kelly's credentials were revoked by the Sheriff and he was fired from the DA's office.

The office has appointed Genesee County District Attorney Larry Friedman as a special prosecutor for the case.

Kelly will appear back in court on June 9.
