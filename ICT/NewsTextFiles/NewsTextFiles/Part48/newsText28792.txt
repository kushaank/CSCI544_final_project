
AS RUSTENBURG’s platinum producers face up to the unpleasant reality that employees will not be returning to work soon, no matter the number of police deployed in the area, they must now look at their remaining options.

None of them is attractive, but some face a better chance of success than others.

The first is to allow the voluntary return to work campaign a better shot by making it safer for those who want to return to work to do so. If this can be done, the producers believe, a trickle may eventually become a flood and the strike will be broken.

This week, police numbers in the area were beefed up and police vehicles escorted buses from pick-up points onto mine property.

But Police Minister Nathi Mthethwa said on Wednesday that police were able to protect workers on their way to and from work, but not in their homes.

An idea being explored by Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) is to accommodate workers who want to return to work in temporary housing on mine property. Because of the large numbers of workers — about 70,000 are on strike in total at all three companies — this would be a huge undertaking. As families would also need to be accommodated, the plan would require nothing short of building tent cities. This would inevitably give rise to a new set of problems around poor living conditions, so success would have to come quickly, with a critical mass of employees returning to work thus breaking the strike.

A second way of making strike-breakers safe would be for the government to declare a state of emergency, institute curfews in the informal settlements around the mines, arrest union leaders and bring in the army.

With the consequences of putting police who are not trained into public order policing still fresh in everybody’s minds, letting the army loose in mining communities is an even less attractive option. A repeat of the killing of workers by security forces would be an unspeakable disaster.

Both these options make a large assumption that a majority want to come back to work.

Employers say they have mountains of evidence to this effect, including replies to SMS surveys and calls made to their call centres. Impala, for instance, has said that an overwhelming majority polled by SMS said they do want to return to work, but when asked whether they would actually do so under the circumstances, most said no.

But these results should be treated with caution. The questions are ambiguous and leading, and employers have every reason to exaggerate their findings. Countering the view that the majority want to come back is that it is abundantly clear that many thousands of workers still firmly back the strike, as seen by attendance at picket lines, union meetings and in interviews with reporters. The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu), contrary to criticism by commentators, has in fact been scrupulous in ensuring it has a mandate from workers and has returned to them to consult at every critical point in the strike.

The main reason for the strong worker support is that there is a firm belief — so far quite unshakeable among both Amcu leaders and the core of strikers — that the R12,500 wage is winnable and affordable. This has kept strikers going in the belief that it will only be a matter of time before greedy managers come to their senses to share their millions.

A third option for employers is to lock out employees and close the mines save for essential operations. This would mean that non-striking workers would be punished by not being paid and the mines would stay closed until strikers returned to work.

This is another poor alternative. The savings made by not paying non-strikers would hardly compensate for the possible loss of skilled employees and the bitterness it would arouse. After a while, another strategy would have to be employed to get a resolution.

But it is worth noting that closing their mines is, for the companies, preferable to paying the increase demanded by Amcu.

Impala spokesman Johan Theron, for instance, says Amcu’s wage demand — a 30% compound increase every year for three years — would put Impala out of business in 18 months. Closing the mine would save cash and preserve the assets for later.

A fourth idea is to give trade unions notice of impending retrenchments and begin processes to do so in the hope that once the reality of job losses hits home, the strike will break. Both Ben Magara, CEO of Lonmin, and Chris Griffith, CEO of Amplats, have said they are contemplating this, which they have stressed would be "separate from the strike".

Layoffs during a strike are controversial as retrenchment requires a meaningful consultation with employees, and considering their suggestions about how costs can be saved.

But Halton Cheadle, a law professor at the University of Cape Town, says legal precedent indicates that the law allows for retrenchment to take place during a strike, provided the employer follows the processes set out in section 189 of the Labour Relations Act.

Should Amcu, for example, refuse to participate in the consultation, employers could go ahead and retrench recalcitrant workers who have in effect refused to accept the conditions of service they offer. Not only has such a course of action been set by precedent, it has also been upheld by the Labour Appeal Court, says Prof Cheadle.

The problem with all of the options above is that none will result in a collective agreement with Amcu. That means the issues that led to the strike in the first place — the workers’ belief that they are not getting a fair share of the proceeds of mining — will continue to rumble under the surface for years to come.

A collective agreement, says industrial sociologist and mining labour specialist Gavin Hartford, is the only way to get "a nonviolent, mass resumption of production. Without a collective agreement, it would be difficult to restore working relations and to create the basis for productivity improvements", which could help compensate employers for raised wages.

Since the Marikana massacre exposed the instability of labour relations in mining, Mr Hartford has argued that fundamental issues such as wages and productivity must be tackled. A key area would be to change the shift system, which sees no work taking place on Sunday and long shutdowns over Christmas and Easter. Linked to this would be reform of the migrant labour system that would see migrants return home more often, leading to more stable communities and families.

This argument has been taken up from a surprising quarter. Investment bank JPMorgan Cazenove argued in an in-depth platinum review issued last week that "until there is a structural shift in remuneration for relatively lowly skilled workers, there will be an ongoing risk of labour unrest".

The review explores the possibility of replacing labour with machines — a fifth possible scenario — but concludes that a mechanised future, both because of the structure of the reef and the structure of existing mine shafts, is 10 to 20 years away.

With a mechanised future "just not possible", the JPMorgan report says "it is essential to remodel the labour-intensive industry in such a way that labour is more productive and can be better paid".

This brings the talk of options facing employers back full circle to where it began: around the table.

The sixth option, returning to talks, is "the only way to prevent a complete routing and destruction of the industry", says Mr Hartford. It is not a popular option among employers, most of whom feel since they have no more money to put on the table, talks with Amcu would not produce much. The government, which at the start of the strike pressed the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration to get talks going, has now cooled on the idea, preferring the law and order solution.

No talks are scheduled.

This has left Amcu a little at sea. In an interview last week, after the government had made clear its position, Amcu president Joseph Mathunjwa appeared dismayed. "I thought after the election the Department of Labour would say: ‘Come, everybody, let’s get around the table.’ But that hasn’t happened. Instead, they have brought the police," he said.

Finding a solution at the table would only be possible if there was a new conversation. Instead of a discussion about R12,500 a month, Amcu and employers would have to broaden the engagement.

While employers say that in previous rounds of talks they have raised ideas about incentives, productivity and profit-sharing to no avail, both sides by now must realise they are in a race to the bottom.

More imaginative proposals will have to be forthcoming.
