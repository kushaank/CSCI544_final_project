Illinois voters have used many elections to make theirs the worst-governed state, with about $100 billion in unfunded public pension promises, and $6.7 billion in unpaid bills. The state is a stark illustration of prolonged one-party rule conducted by politicians subservient to government employees unions.

A new Gallup poll shows Illinois has the highest percentage — 50 percent — of residents who want to leave their state. If Illinois voters re-elect Gov. Pat Quinn, 65, they will reject Bruce Rauner, 58, who vows to change the state's fundamental affliction — its political culture.

The state's strongest civic tradition is of governors going to jail. Four of the last nine have done so. In 2009, then-Lt. Gov. Quinn ascended to the governorship because Rod Blagojevich, of fragrant memory, tried to sell the Senate seat Barack Obama vacated.
