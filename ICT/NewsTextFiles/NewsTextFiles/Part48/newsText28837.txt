
Polling places open at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m.

In between, voters will select Democratic candidates to oppose Republican Gov. Tom Corbett and his running mate, Lt. Gov. Jim Cawley, in November�s general election.

Delaware County voters also will determine the Democratic candidate for the 164th Legislative District, the county�s lone contested primary involving a General Assembly seat. There are 21 uncontested primaries for the state Legislature and four uncontested primaries for the U.S. House of Representatives.

Businessman Tom Wolf is the frontrunner among four Democrats competing for the chance to take on Corbett in the fall. U.S. Rep. Allyson Schwartz, state Treasurer Rob McCord and former Department of Environmental Protection secretary Katie McGinty also seek the party�s nomination.

Corbett initially faced a primary challenger in Bob Guzzardi, an Ardmore businessman, but Guzzardi was removed from the ballot. The state Supreme Court ruled that Guzzardi�s failure to file his statement of financial interests on time disqualified him.

There are five candidates for seeking the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor: state Sen. Mike Stack, D-5; former U.S. Rep. Mark Critz; Bradford County Commissioner Mark Smith; state Rep. Brandon Neuman, D-48; and Harrisburg City Councilman Brad Koplinski.

In the 164th Legislative District, state Rep. Margo Davidson, of Upper Darby, faces of a pair of challengers in attorney Billy Smith, of Lansdowne, and Delaware County Community College adjunct professor Dafan Zhang, of East Lansdowne. The winner will face Republican Saud Siddiqui, of Upper Darby, in the fall.

David Landau, chairman of the county Democrats, said he was hopeful turnout would be about 30 percent. Andy Reilly, chairman of the county Republicans, predicated it would be closer to 20 percent.
