(TRNS) — Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney called on the embattled police commissioner in New Hampshire, who described President Obama using a racial slur, to resign over the weekend.

“The vile epithet used and confirmed by the commissioner has no place in our community,” Romney said in a statement to the Boston Herald. “He should apologize and resign.

Bob Copeland, the New Hampshire Police Commissioner, was caught calling Obama “the N-word,” and has since refused to apologize.

Copeland, who is 82 years old, was reportedly overheard making the remarks by a local resident in a restaurant, and subsequently wrote a letter to the local town manager.

The New Hampshire police commissioner then responded to the claims, releasing a statement acknowledging the reports.
