
PLOVER, Wis. -- Police have released more details about the fatal shooting at the home of an off-duty Portage County sheriff's deputy over the weekend.

Plover police say Tony Gischia returned home with another person early Saturday when they were confronted by a masked intruder. They say the intruder was shot and killed during a scuffle.

A police statement released Monday doesn't say who fired the shot. Police referred questions to the Wisconsin Department of Justice, where a spokeswoman didn't immediately return a message.

The alleged intruder was identified as 30-year-old Charles Jameson of Stevens Point. Police say Gischia and the other individual both knew Jameson.

The investigation is being led by the Justice Department, in compliance with a new law that prevents law enforcement agencies from leading investigations into their own officer-involved fatal shootings.
