Taipei, Taiwan – ATP, the leading manufacturer of embedded Flash, ruggedized SSD and DRAM modules, introduces a new DRAM module product line for operating under -40C to 85C wide temperature (WT) conditions. This new solution targets industrial applications such as telecom, networking, IPC, automation and ruggedized systems, and achieve the best total cost ownership (TCO) with long term system reliability.  Available immediately in DDR3 SODIMMs, mini-DIMMs, and VLP DIMMs, in densities from 4GB to 8GB, ATP will showcase these products along with other ATP memory and NAND storage solutions at the 2014 Embedded Systems (ESEC) Expo Japan from May 14 to 16 at the Tokyo Big Sight. ATP booth location is West 9-48.

With strong demands from ATP’s industrial customers for a cost-effective wide temp DRAM solution, ATP utilizes its unique technologies in both IC sorting process to weed out specific weak DRAM ICs, and system level Test During Burn-In (TDBI) to ensure the modules meet and exceed extreme wide temp operating conditions. In addition, specific test patterns can be designed and run on the Automatic Testing Equipment (ATE) per customer’s unique operating conditions. These testing steps allow ATP to offer WT products without incurring heavy BOM costs. Based on user data in the field, ATP wide temp DRAM modules have proven to provide higher reliability in the long run, in addition to providing a superior overall system-wide stability over typical commercial temp DRAM modules.

As with all ATP product offerings, the new WT DRAM solution follows ATP’s controlled BOM policy to address the continuous supply chain requirements of mission-critical applications.
