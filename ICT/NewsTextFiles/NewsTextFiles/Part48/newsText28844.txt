The Oklahoma Center for Community and Justice is accepting registration for Camp Anytown, a summer program that focuses on diversity and inclusion.

The camp program, set for June 15-21 at Dwight Mission Camp in Vian, is open to incoming sophomores, juniors and seniors from Oklahoma high schools.

Jayme Cox, executive director of the Tulsa-based center, said she would like to see more young people from the Oklahoma City metro area participate in the annual camp, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary.

Moises Echeverria, a program coordinator at the center and co-director for Camp Anytown, said the camp offers a fun, interactive way for the center to share its mission with young people — and hope they help share its message of inclusion with others. The center is dedicated to fighting bias, bigotry and racism, while promoting racial, religious and cultural understanding and respect. For many years, the center has had a strong presence in Tulsa, and an Oklahoma City affiliate was started last year.

•Cost: $300, includes round-trip bus transportation from Tulsa to camp, meals, housing, workshop materials.

•Deadline: Friday.
