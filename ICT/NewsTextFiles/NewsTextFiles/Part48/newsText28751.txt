There seems to be some uncertainty about child abuse in Pennsylvania.

A new survey commissioned by the Pennsylvania Family Support Alliance shows that only 17% of those responding believe that child abuse is a serious problem.  Of those polled who had witnessed child abuse take place, only one third reported the abuse to Childline at the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare.

Pennsylvania recently enacted several pieces of legislation to combat child abuse based on recommendations from the Task Force on Child Protection.

On Tuesday's Smart Talk, Angela Liddle from the Pennsylvania Family Support Alliance (PFSA) will be joined by Attorney Jason Kutulakis, who was a member of the Governor’s appointed Task Force on Child Protection.

If you have witnessed child abuse please contact Childline at (800)932-0313.
