
SAN ANTONIO — A San Antonio police officer shot and killed a woman late Sunday on the West Side.

Officers and emergency medical technicians were summoned to a home in the 7600 block of U.S. 90 by someone who reported a woman was cutting herself with a knife. Officer Alexander Moya , a two-year veteran, arrived with EMTs and went inside to talk to the woman, according to police.

Sheila Vawter met the officer in a bedroom, “brandishing a large fishing knife,” according to an SAPD release.

Vawter, 44, advanced on the officer, who backed away and told her to drop the knife, according to police. Vawter kept coming toward Moya until he could not retreat any further, police said. Moya fired one shot from his service pistol, hitting Vawter in the chest, police said.

Vawter was taken to University Hospital , where she was pronounced dead.

The department's Officer-Involved Shooting Team is investigating the incident. Moya was placed on administrative duty during the investigation, per department policy.
