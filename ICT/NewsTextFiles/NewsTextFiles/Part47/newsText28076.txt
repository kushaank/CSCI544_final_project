
Indiana will use a new drug as part of its lethal injection protocol whenever it carries out its next execution, a prison spokesman says.

A nationwide shortage of thiopental sodium has forced states that conduct lethal injection executions to search for alternatives, and Indiana has settled on a barbiturate anesthetic in the same class called Brevital, Indiana Department of Correction spokesman Doug Garrison told the Post-Tribune.

Oklahomaâ€™s botched execution of convicted murderer Clayton Lockett on April 29 touched off a national debate over the death penalty. Because of opposition to the death penalty by suppliers of thiopental sodium, Oklahoma experimented with a sedative called midazolam as part of its three-drug protocol when it executed Lockett. Lockett died of an apparent heart attack 43 minutes after the start of his execution.
