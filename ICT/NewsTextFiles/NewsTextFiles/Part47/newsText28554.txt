
A student at Natchitoches Central High School is in a Shreveport hospital Monday afternoon suffering from fight-related life-threatening injuries.

Family and friends of a 6-year-old boy, who was killed after being hit by his school bus last week, remembered him during a memorial service on Monday.

Brenden Seven Houston attended Herndon Magnet School and was said to be a straight-A first grader there. His memorial service was held at Trinity Heights Baptist Church.  About 75 family members from around the region attended as well as some of Brenden's classmates.

There was a short video played with Brenden's pictures. The video did draw some tears but for the most part there were plenty of smiles. Friends shared silly stories about Brenden, adding that's exactly how he would have wanted the services to go.

Rev. Kris Chenier reminded the crowd that Brenden wouldn't want any tears or any sad faces at all.

Brenden's grandfather Randy Riley said the past week has been extremely tough on their family but they've made through with the help of the community. Riley also said the family has no ill will towards the driver of the school bus that hit the young boy.

"We certainly want to extend to her our love and support and total forgiveness," he said. "We have absolutely no animosity toward her. It's just what you call an accident and if the Lord allows it, we'll learn to deal with it if that's what his will is going to be. We're OK."

The family is asking that, in lieu flowers, donations be sent to the Children's Ministry at Trinity Heights Baptist Church.
