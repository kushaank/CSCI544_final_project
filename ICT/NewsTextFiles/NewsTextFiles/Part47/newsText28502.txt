
A former fourth-grade teacher for Minneapolis Public Schools, accused of trying to kill his stepson with an ax, pleaded guilty Monday to second-degree assault.

Mark Revere James, 62, will be sentenced Aug. 1 to between 18 and 21 months in prison, in accordance with state sentencing guidelines, the Ramsey County attorney's office said.

James and his 40-year-old stepson argued the morning of Feb. 16. James was angry that the stepson, who lived in the basement of his mother's and stepfather's St. Paul home, had used James' credit card to charge $150 worth of Android games, according to the criminal complaint.

"Well, I grabbed an ax out of the garage, and I tried to kill my wife's son," James told police, according to the complaint. "I swung the ax at him, and I wanted to kill the (expletive) and I missed."

After demanding that the stepson leave, James hit him in the face with the ax, the complaint said. The stepson's 18-month-old toddler was in the house, in the 1500 block of Race Street in the West Seventh neighborhood, during the attack.

James had been charged in Ramsey County District Court with first- and second-degree attempted murder.

After being charged, he was placed on administrative leave from his job as a teacher at Anishinabe Academy in Minneapolis. He resigned April 7.

James is "no longer employed with Minneapolis Public Schools," spokeswoman Larissa Mavros said.

James remains out on bail.
