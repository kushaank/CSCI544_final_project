
In recent developments published in a report in Reuters on May 19, A U.S. grand jury has accused five Chinese military officers on multiple grounds and hacking trade secrets of American companies.

This is now being counted as the toughest step against China taken by US on issues related to cyber spying.

China, on the other hand, has denied the charges indicted, saying these were made up and may damage the trust shared by both countries.

The Chinese foreign ministry has confirmed that the Sino-U.S. Internet group activities will be suspended.

According to the report, the five Chinese suspects were targeting companies in Pittsburg, most being industries related to solar products, nuclear power, and metals.

The Department of Justice officials has confirmed the companies to be United States Steel Corp, Alcoa Inc, Allegheny Technologies Inc, SolarWorld AG, Westinghouse Electric Co along with a steel workers union.

This comes after the long cry by American businesses on cyber spying from other places, mainly by China. WikiLeaks had found Secret U.S. State Department cables, which showed huge system breaches by Chine back in 2011.

However, U.S. authorities may not be able arrest the five indicted as Beijing might not agree to hand them over. Although, experts believe there can be much impact on others indicted of hacking U.S. companies.
