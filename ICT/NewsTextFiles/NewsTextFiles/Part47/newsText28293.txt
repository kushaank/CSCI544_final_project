The Oregon Military Department released photos Monday of a 534-foot U.S. Navy ship that sailed down the Columbia River out to the Pacific Ocean on its way to monitor missile launches and weapons tests conducted around the world.

The USNS Howard O. Lorenzen is one of three missile-range instrumentation ships operated by the Navy's Military Sealift Command and works in the Pacific. It does missions sponsored by the U.S. Air Force.

The ship sailed down the lower Columbia and across the Columbia Bar last Friday.
