
A mother has been reunited with her now 12-year-old daughter five years after she went missing.

Cara Cox was just eight years old when she was abducted by her father, Aaron Cox, during a custodial visit in Deltona, Florida 2009.

For the next five years Cara's mother Jodie Borchert searched fruitlessly for her little girl, while every two years police would release a new computer-aged image of what Cara would look like.

It was one of these composites, posted to Ms Borchert's Facebook page on May 12, that ultimately helped this desperate mother track down her missing daughter.

"Hi Cara baby, this is mommy wishing you had been here on this my fifth Mother’s Day without you, I miss you more than words can say! Please keep trying to reach us, don’t ever give up we are all still here and looking for you ....... always."

Shortly after, police received an anonymous tip-off that Cara was living in Mexico.

Over the next five days local authorities worked with an international-fugitive task force with a mission to bring Cara home.

After days of searching, officials finally found the girl living with her father in the remote Mexican mountains.

Authorities said Mr Cox and his daughter had been living by fake names.

Mr Cox has since been arrested while Cara has been granted an American passport and flown home to meet her new baby sister, Nora, who was born after her abduction.
