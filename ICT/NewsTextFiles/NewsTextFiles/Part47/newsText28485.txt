DALLAS (AP) â€” Southwest Airlines plans to add two new international destinations this fall, and it's also offering a sale to boost new flights from its Dallas home.

Southwest will fly to Mexico City and Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, starting Nov. 2, replacing AirTran service.

Southwest also said Monday it began selling flights from Dallas to 15 distant U.S. cities including New York and Los Angeles. The flights start once federal restrictions on Dallas Love Field expire Oct. 13.

The airline says it will sell a limited number of seats on those flights for $99 or less each way. The five-day sale running through Friday covers travel from Oct. 13 or Nov. 2 through Dec. 17, but the best prices aren't available on Fridays or Sundays or during nine days around Thanksgiving.
