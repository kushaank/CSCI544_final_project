BINGHAMTON, N.Y. -- A current Binghamton police officer and a former city police officer were killed Sunday night in a motorcycle accident on Route 434 near Pennsylvania Avenue in the city.

Christopher A. Stoeckel served as an officer from March 2008 to October 2012, according to Binghamton police.

Binghamton Police Officer Katie Brown, a three-year veteran of the department, was  transported to Wilson Hospital, where she was pronounced dead.

Brown, 28 of Binghamton, was a passenger. Stoeckel lost control and struck a guide rail, police said.

Speed was a factor and toxicology results are pending, police stated.

Stockel resigned after being charged with DWI shortly after he arrived at work in October 2012. That case was reportedly still making its way through the courts at the time of the crash.

“Once again our local law enforcement community is mourning the loss of a police officer.  We have not had a chance to completely mourn the loss of [Johnson City police] officer Dave Smith and now we are faced with the loss of Officer Katie Brown," Binghamton police Chief Joseph Zikuski said. "This is a very difficult time for the Binghamton and Johnson City police departments and all local law enforcement."

Funeral services for Brown are being arranged by her family and services will be held in her home state of Indiana.

“Although Officer Brown was only with us for a few years, she like all other law enforcement officers was dedicated to serving and protecting her community.  She will be missed by her family, friends and co-workers," Zikuski said.

The accident is still under investigation.
