BIRMINGHAM, Alabama - A judge has delayed the trial of a man  charged with attempted murder , related to a 2012 interstate shootout with Mayor William Bell's security team, after prosecutors could not find a witness.

On Thursday, however, Deputy Jefferson County District Attorney Carl S. Randall filed a motion asking for the trial to be continued.  Prosecutors have been unable to reach a witness who was riding with Major, but believes the witness can be located with more time, Randall stated in the motion.

Judge Vinson granted Randall's motion Friday. She did not set a new date for the trial.

Major is serving time in state prison after his probation was revoked on marijuana possession and robbery charges from 2010 and 2011. Those charges are unrelated to the interstate incident.

Major's attorney, Sheila Ann Weil, has previously noted that Major had two other people, a man and woman, in the car with him. Both those people were wounded and were not charged.
