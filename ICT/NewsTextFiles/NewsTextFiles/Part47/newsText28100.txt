
(WHAS11) – A Pennsylvania girl is lucky to be alive after nearly being hit by a car fleeing from police.

The 8-year-old was playing on the sidewalk in Erie, Pennsylvania when surveillance video captures her being hit by the car sending her flying.

Her 5-year-old sister barely moved out of the way in time.

The 8-year-old suffered a concussion but is doing fine, according to her parents. Needless to say, the experience has traumatized her.

“Right now, I’m scared of cars because of what happened to me Friday night,” she said.

Two men have been charged in connection with the crash.
