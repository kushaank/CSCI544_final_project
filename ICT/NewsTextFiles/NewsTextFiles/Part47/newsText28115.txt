A 10-year-old dachshund, named Sebastian, was killed over the weekend by a loose pit bull in a convenience store parking lot in Englewood.

The pit bull dashed inside the 7-Eleven Store, 3131 S. Broadway, when the front door opened and grabbed Sebastian, who was on a leash and had been hiding behind his owner's mobility scooter.

"He didn't deserve to die like that," said Sebastian's owner, Eileen Trujillo, 63, who uses the scooter because she has polio.
