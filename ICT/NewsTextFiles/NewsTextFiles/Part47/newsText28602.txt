Proxy Voting RIAs are not required to vote proxies on behalf of their clients.  However, when an RIA does assume responsibility for voting proxies, the firm’s policies and procedures should help to ensure that votes are cast in the best interest of clients.

Client Commission Practices and Soft Dollars RIAs should always evaluate whether the products and services they receive from broker-dealers are appropriate. The SEC suggested that an RIAs failure to stay within the scope of the Section 28(e) safe harbor may violate the advisors fiduciary duty to clients, so RIAs must evaluate their soft dollar relationships on a regular basis to ensure they are disclosed properly and that they do not negatively impact the best execution of clients transactions.

That being said, Ketchum said that FINRA recognized “that costs tied to CARDS are a real issue for firms,” stating that’s FINRA has created a CARDS “pilot” and is talking to BDs about the “real, bottom-line impact” it may have on their firms.

CARDS would be a rule-based program that would allow FINRA to collect — on a standardized, automated and regular basis — account information, as well as account activity and security identification information that a firm maintains as part of its books and records.

The automated system would gather data from broker-dealers and clearing firms that the regulator can then use to spot potential problems with sales practices of individual BDs, branches and reps prior to onsite FINRA exams.

If “we can get it right and get safeguards around it, it will be the next-gen form of regulation” that other regulators can look to, he said.

Michelle Oroschakoff, chief risk officer of LPL Financial, noted on a separate panel on the top 10 regulatory issues that "if done right," CARDS "is going to be terrific" for the markets and for investors, allowing "more targeted [exam] sweeps." However, she said that advisors were already getting questions from their clients about CARDS regarding data privacy issues and that the "investing public is not as supportive of" CARDS as may have been thought.

BDs’ feedback has already changed the original CARDS plan, which was issued as a concept release.

After pushback, FINRA said in early March that it would modify its original approach by not collecting sensitive personally identifying information (PII) from the data it receives from CARDS, a point that Ketchum noted during his Monday remarks.

But Paul Tolley, chief compliance officer of Commonwealth Financial Network, noted on a panel discussion about the top 10 regulatory issues that he's "not a fan" of CARDS, particularly due to its "privacy" concerns. "The sheer volume" of data in "such a huge database," if breached, could be a problem, he said. "There are some pretty sophisticated systems that have been breached," noting that such a breach of CARDS could spark market manipulation.

Firms raised concerns about having to send the data through clearing firms, with many BDs worrying about “the cost implications of working with a clearing firm, especially since nearly 2,000 firms don’t currently have clearing firm relationships,” Ketchum said.

To address concerns about “direct business data and how the clearing firms would handle that data,” Ketchum noted that “in its initial phases, CARDS will not require firms to submit information about products not held at the firm,” such as variable annuities, direct participation programs and direct mutual funds.

Ketchum also addressed the question of why FINRA doesn’t first tackle implementing the consolidated audit trail (CAT) before CARDS.
