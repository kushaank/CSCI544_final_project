As the number of tourists increases, so have the companies providing neighborhood walking tours—at least a dozen coming to the Mission. Not everyone, however, is thrilled about these arrivals.

Clarion Alley Mural Project (CAMP), the non-profit that first organized the creation of murals in Clarion Alley in the 1990s, has asked private tour companies to refrain from including Clarion in their tours—going so far as  to list specific companies contacted on their website  including: Avital Tours, Precita Eyes, Wild SF, Dylan’s Tours, and the Real SF.

Wilson says that despite notifying numerous companies to cease offering tours of Clarion Alley, she’s observed new tours coming through the alley every day she’s there. These visitors are part of a growing trend affecting the entire city.  According to the San Francisco Travel Foundation , the city welcomed 16.9 million tourists in 2013, a 13 year high.
