
A four-year-old northwest Indiana boy has died after he allegedly found a handgun in his parents' bedroom and accidentally shot himself in the head.

Cash Irby, Jr. of Merrillville was pronounced dead Saturday morning at a local hospital.

Merrillville Police Commander Jeff Rice says Irby took a gun from his parents' bedroom and took it to his room, where the gun discharged.

The Lake County coroner's office listed the boy's cause of death as an accidental gunshot wound to the head. He was pronounced dead at 8:47am.

'They always kept it up in the closet behind shoes and clothes and boxes,' White-Gisbon told WGN-TV , 'so we're not sure how he ever saw it.'

She says the family kept the handgun for protection.

According White-Gibson, the boy's father was tending to the couple's one-year-old and his wife was bathing their five-year-old daughter when they heard the gun go off in the little boy's bedroom in their home on the 6400 block of Cleveland Street.

'Baby Cash was in his room, playing,' Kelly White-Gibson told The Times of Munster.

'[The father] went into his room and saw him and called 911 and stayed on the line until police arrived.'

She described the little Cash Irby Jr.'s parents as 'distraught' at the loss of their beloved little boy.

'Baby Cash was just such a bright child. Just an affectionate little boy, very active, very playful,' she said. 'And he was such a daddy's boy. He used to climb up on my cousin's lap and kiss him every five minutes.'
