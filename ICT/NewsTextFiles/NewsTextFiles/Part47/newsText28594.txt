
A high school senior from Newington, Connecticut didn’t expect a response when she invited Joe Biden to her prom months ago, but last week she got quite the surprise.

He didn’t take Talia Maselli to the dance, but he did send a corsage — with red, white and blue flowers.

In that letter, she said that if Biden turned her down, House Speaker John Boehner would be her second choice. “And we can’t have that now can we,” she wrote.

When the corsage showed up on Thursday, the day before the prom, it had a note with it.

At first she thought it was a prank by her mother, but the number on the card didn’t lead to a florist. It was a secretary at the vice president’s office.

Maselli didn’t end up going to the prom, but she did get an invitation to the White House.

“I’d rather go to the White House anyway!” she said.
