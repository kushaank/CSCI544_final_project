
ALBANY, N.Y. -- The former senate majority leader recently found not guilty of fraud is eligible to apply for reimbursement of the millions he spent on his defense.

Joe Bruno, 85, was accused of federal corruption and over the last eight years there have been two trials and an appeal.

Now that he's been acquitted with a jury finding him not guilty of honest service mail fraud on Friday, the senator can apply to get all the money spent back.

He would have to apply to the State Attorney General under a provision of the public officerâ€™s law. Bruno said his legal expenses amount to nearly $4 million, and he said the cost would fall on taxpayers.
