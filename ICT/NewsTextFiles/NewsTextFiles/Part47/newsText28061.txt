
HOPKINSVILLE, Ky. â€“ A man wanted in connection with a deadly shooting in Hopkinsville has been arrested.

Brandon Demar Smith, age 21, surrendered to police Sunday night. He was charged with murder and possession of a handgun by a convicted felon. Investigators said he was involved in the death of 28-year-old Keon Grant, who was shot Wednesday night near East 1st Street and Vine Street in Hopkinsville.

According to an arrest report, an altercation broke out between Smith and Grant at the home of 23-year-old Cory Barnes. The fight eventually led to the shooting.

Officers from the Hopkinsville Police Department were called to the scene. Grant was taken to the Jennie Stuart Medical Center, where he was pronounced deceased.

After police told him Smith was wanted for the murder, they said Barnes aided Smith by providing false information.

Barnes apparently told police he had been sleeping, that no one was in his home, and that he had not seen Smith or Grant that day. Barnes was arrested and charged with hindering prosecution in the case. Bail was set at $5,000.

Smith was held at the Christian County Jail without bond.
