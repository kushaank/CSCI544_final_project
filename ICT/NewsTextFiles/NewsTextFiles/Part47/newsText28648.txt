
MAPLE GROVE, Minn. (AP) -- Authorities are searching the home of a Maple Grove girl who disappeared 25 years ago at age 13.

Maple Grove Police Captain Keith Terlinden says authorities executed a search warrant Sunday morning at the home where Amy Sue Pagnac used to live.

Amy disappeared from an Osseo gas station in 1989. Her stepfather had stopped to use the restroom, and he told police she was gone when he returned.

Terlinden declined to say whether the parents, Susan Pagnac Sr. and Marshall Midden, were suspects. Nor would he say what prompted the search, adding that the warrant was sealed and not available to the public.

Susan Pagnac says she's not sure what led authorities back to her home, but it's "wonderful" that they're stepping up the investigation. Midden declined to comment.
