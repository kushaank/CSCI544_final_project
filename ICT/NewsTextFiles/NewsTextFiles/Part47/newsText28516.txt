A commencement speaker at Pennsylvania's Haverford College on Sunday called students immature for having staged a protest over another person who had been scheduled to speak.

William Bowen, a former president of Princeton University, criticized students who had objected to Haverford's having invited Robert Birgeneau, a former chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley, to speak at commencement. Some Haverford students were upset because they believed Dr. Birgeneau, a highly regarded physicist, had played a role in police's allegedly violently squelching a 2011 protest at the Berkeley campus, according to Phil Drexler, president of the Haverford Students' Council.

Haverford students had asked Dr. Birgeneau to apologize and explain his role in the incident before speaking at their school, but he declined, said Mr. Drexler.

Mr. Bowen, who received an honorary degree, offered a "blunt indictment" of graduates, saying universities inevitably choose commencement speakers who have voiced opinions that some may find offensive, Mr. Drexler said. "He said, 'The best you can do is listen to them and be open minded.' "

Mr. Drexler said some in the audience were upset but others gave a standing ovation. "I felt validated by the speech because I had wanted to hear Dr. Birgeneau talk," said Mr. Drexler, a graduating physics major. On the plus side, he added, he likely won't soon forget his commencement.

A spokesman for Haverford didn't respond to a request for comment.
