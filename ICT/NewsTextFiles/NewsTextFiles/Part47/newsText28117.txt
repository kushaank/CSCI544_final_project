
SACRAMENTO COUNTY (CBS13) – Deputies say that a man has been arrested for the murder of his 75-year-old mother in Antelope Sunday afternoon.

According to a release from the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department, deputies were first alerted to the situation due to an incomplete 911 call that came from a home along the 8000 block of Silk Tree Way.

Dispatchers say that the man on the line said he had a fight with his mother at the home and then the line disconnected.

Deputies soon showed up at the home and found a 75-year-old woman dead inside. The woman’s son, 53-year-old John David Matta, was arrested at the scene and eventually booked at Sacramento County Jail on a charge of murder. He is said to be the only other known resident of the home.

Detectives are trying to sort out the circumstances surrounding the fight that led to the woman’s death.

Anyone with more information is asked to call the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Homicide Bureau at (916) 874-5115.
