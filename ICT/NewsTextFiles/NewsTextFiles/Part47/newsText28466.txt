
VOORHEES, N.J.--( BUSINESS WIRE )--New Jersey American Water announces a new program that provides rugged        Toughbook computers to non-profit organizations, primarily volunteer        firefighters and emergency responders in the company’s service areas.        New Jersey American Water has a scheduled replacement program for some        of its computer hardware including Toughbook computers.

The rugged, reliable computers are designed to withstand drops, spills        and be used in the harsh environments that water utility employees        frequently find themselves. “Hopefully the volunteers will make similar        use of them in their environment,” said Eschbach.
