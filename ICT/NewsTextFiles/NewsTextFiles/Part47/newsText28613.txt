
MUNSTER, Indiana — The administration of Gov. Mike Pence plans to promote his proposed alternative to a Medicaid expansion with advertising and public events.

The Pence plan, which he has dubbed the Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0, doesn't have federal approval yet, so the marketing contract is contingent on gaining it.

Proposals are due Friday with a vendor set to be selected Sept. 12.

Major promotional activities including a 30-second television ad, radio ads, and billboards would start in January and run through June. Pence wants HIP 2.0 serving Hoosiers early next year.
