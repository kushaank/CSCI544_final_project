
Biden is taking shots from both Democrats and Republicans.

Former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell (D) told MSNBC’s Alex Wagner the Democrats have a deep “bench” if Hillary Clinton decides not to run for president Monday on NOW.

“We have a very powerful pinch hitter and that’s Joe Biden. People who underestimate Joe Biden do it at their own peril. If Hillary says no he’ll be tough to beat,” Rendell said.

The former Pennsylvania governor’s backhanded compliment evidences Biden’s continued struggle to escape Clinton’s shadow as both consider 2016 runs. Biden currently trails Clinton by 55 percent in a Huffington Post compilation of National Democratic primary polls.
