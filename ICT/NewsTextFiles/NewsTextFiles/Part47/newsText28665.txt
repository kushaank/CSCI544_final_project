
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Authorities have identified two men killed when their car plunged 720 feet off a Southern California mountain road.

The Los Angeles Times says the driver was 22-year-old Sergio O. Partida and the passenger was 21-year-old Andrew S. Barrios, both of Ontario.

The California Highway Patrol says they were found dead Sunday morning in the Angeles National Forest, about 40 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles and five miles west of Mount Baldy.

The CHP says the car was found after a motorist noticed skid marks on Glendora Ridge Road.

The CHP says it appears the car went out of control on a left curve, plunged down an embankment and overturned several times.

Both men wore seatbelts but were flung from the car.
