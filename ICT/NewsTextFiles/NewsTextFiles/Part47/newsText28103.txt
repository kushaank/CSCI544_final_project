
The body of Chong Va Lee was found just below the Oxford Dam on the Catawba River, not far from where his canoe was found Saturday.

Investigators in Iredell County have arrested a man who was wanted on 11 counts of rape and other sex crimes.

Jarred Ashley Workman, 27, of Albemarle, is charged with 11 felony charges of rape and five felony charges of statutory sex offense.

In his initial court appearance on Tuesday, a judge told Workman he could face life in prison without parole if convicted on the charges. He was given a court appointed attorney.

Workman's last known address was on Woodhaven Drive in Albemarle.

Deputies responded to a home in northern Iredell County on May 2 after a woman called 911 and told the dispatcher she found a man, later identified as Workman, in her daughter's bedroom closet.

While on the track, K-9 units found a wallet and cellular telephone.

The homeowner told investigators that her daughter had met a man online and had been chatting with him for about a week.

They met in the woods near her home and then she invited him into her residence.

The young lady was then scheduled for an interview at the Dove House Child Advocacy Center.

After the interview, detectives filed the charges against Workman.
