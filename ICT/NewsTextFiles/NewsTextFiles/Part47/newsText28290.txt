
Columbus International has appointed BNY Mellon as trustee, paying agent, registrar and transfer agent for its $1.25 billion corporate bond issuance.

The firms already have a relationship, as Richard Hugh, vice president of corporate development at Columbus International commented.

"We chose to work with BNY Mellon on this transaction because of the longstanding relationship we have with them and their history of supporting our company", said Hugh.

â€œBeing appointed to such a high-profile transaction illustrates the market's trust in our global capabilities and expertise," added Chaliha.

As of 31 March, BNY Mellon was the trustee and/or paying agent for more than 65,000 debt-related issues globally.
