
DOVER, Del., – Today, May 19th, Lt. Governor Matt Denn will welcome winners of the 6th Annual Lt. Governor’s Art Contest to Legislative Hall in Dover.

This year, the contest received hundreds of amazing entries from students all over Delaware. Each entry was truly unique and showed particular character. Art came from schools all over Delaware and was done by artists from Pre-K through 12th grade. Thirty pieces were chosen in 12 categories (1st, 2nd, 3rd places & honorable mention in elementary, middle and high school categories).

This year’s theme was “Family Fun in Delaware.” Participants created a piece of art that highlighted what family fun in Delaware means to them. Winners will have their artwork displayed in the Lt. Governor’s Dover and Wilmington offices for the entire year following the contest.
