
Scientific research of climate change and its effects on California’s agricultural sector , are stirring concerns for both farmers and scientists.

Scientists are continuing to express challenges brought on by global warming , particularly rising temperatures.

Increased heat, potentially brought on by global warming, is seen in studies to change precipitation patterns and also cause an increase in the demand for crops’ water supply.  This also results in fewer cool hours for trees that require it to bare fruit and nuts, according to Dennis Baldocchi, an environmental scientist at the University of California Berkeley.

Environmental scientists’ research, related to the topic of climate, holds the interest of the many farmers who see the direct effects of these changes.  Baldocchi explained that he has many farm advisors calling and talking to him because they are finding that the buds on their cherry trees are warmer in the winter time.

A Hillside Family Farms employee who wished to remain anonymous spoke to this issue of climate change that resonated with him.

They explained while they sometimes have to raise their prices, its typically no more than a quarter or fifty cents.

Berumen Boyz Farms in Fountain Valley are seeing a mix of the effects from the hotter temperatures.
