
Agriculture may break new ground if the FAA allows early use of drones to guide farmers, the Wichita Business Journal reports.

The Federal Aviation Administration is considering allowing unmanned aerial vehicles to be used in a few key industries while it works on a larger set of rules. One of the industries that may get an early exemption is precision agriculture.

The move may be especially good for Kansas. While agriculture has been a top industry in the state, studies show the state also is positioned to become a leader in the manufacture of drone aircraft , the Wichita Business Journal reports. One report states that the industry could bring 2,500 jobs to the state by 2015 and 3,700 by 2025.
