
Yavapai County Sheriff's deputies say 48-year-old Ethelyn Hartline died Saturday when a van struck her bicycle.

Spokesman Dwight D'Evelyn says Hartline was thrown from the bicycle and into the car's windshield before landing on the side of the road.

D'Evelyn says she was declared dead at a Flagstaff hospital a short time later.

Authorities say a 52-year-old man and his 16-year-old daughter, who were riding a tandem bike, were injured. They have since been treated and released.

The van's driver, 90-year-old Nelson Shaum, told deputies he thought he had room to pass the cyclists.

Deputies say he wasn't hurt and showed no signs of impairment.

The investigation remains ongoing.
