
Two Kansas City area residents were arrested early Monday morning following a high-speed chase that began on Interstate 70 in Dickinson County.

Saline County Sheriffâ€™s Deputy Rick Heinrich said the pursuit began just before 5:30 a.m. in Dickinson County with speeds in excess of 100 mph.

Saline County deputies became involved in the chase at the Niles exit, about 10 miles east of Salina. Speeds dropped after a Salina Police officer was able to spike one tire on the 2007 Honda Civic at Ohio Street and I-70. Deputies pursued the car on I-70, U.S. 81, Kansas 143 and county roads.

The chase ended about 6 a.m. on North Hedville Road between Watkins and Shipton Road, when the driver 29-year-old Greggory Bennett of Olathe allegedly got out of the car and ran.

Bennett reportedly jumped a fence and ran into a field and fell down before being apprehended. Bennett was arrested on requested charges of felony fleeing and eluding, felony obstruction, DUI, reckless driving, driving with suspended license, and transporting an open container of alcohol.

A passenger, 34-year-old Irina Jorgenson, Olathe, was charged with transporting an open container of alcohol.
