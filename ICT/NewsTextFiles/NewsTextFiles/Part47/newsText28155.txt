
Three South Dakota ranchers offer mob grazing tips, how-to advice and anecdotes in three videos shot by South Dakota State University staff.

Pat Guptill, Quinn; Charlie Totten, Chamberlain; and Richard Smith, Hayti, SD, tell how mob grazing has improved forage production, stretched their grass supply, increased stocking rates, upped soil health, made cows happier and healthier and put some extra income in their pockets.

Guptill says before mob grazing he was never content with the way his grass looked. "We were never gaining anything," he says. Since they started moving the cattle several times a day, they've seen forage production rise, more grass species move in and soil health improve.

He tries to leave 800-1,000 lbs. of forage behind the cows. He figures that is enough to keep the soil microbes.
