Former New York Times Executive Editor Jill Abramson didnâ€™t shed any light on the circumstances of her sudden ousting from one of journalismâ€™s top jobs during her commencement address at Wake Forest University on Monday morning. But she told the universityâ€™s 1,880 new graduates that she can relate to them in new ways now.

â€œWhatâ€™s next for me? I donâ€™t know. So Iâ€™m in exactly the same boat as many of you,â€� she said to applause.

Abramson was already scheduled to speak at Wake Forestâ€™s ceremony in Winston-Salem before her unexpected departure from the Times newsroom last week. Times officials cited management issues and poor leadership, while other reporting suggested Abramsonâ€™s discovery that her compensation as the newspaperâ€™s first female top editor was below the level of her male predecessor was key.

After wryly congratulating the Class of 2014 on the media attention their academic success had attracted, Abramson said her sister called her shortly after news of her ouster broke and told her that their father would be as proud of her today as the day she won the job.
