An 18-year-old senior at Brooklyn Technical High School who suffers from type 1 diabetes has been missing since Thursday, his terrified mother said Sunday.

Aidan Norvez, who is debating going to John Jay College or entering a seminary after graduation, is normally very responsible, the mom said. He needs regular insulin injections.

“My dearest hope is that my son for the first time in his life has completely flaked out, and someone is going to find him,” said Tara Norvez.

The 5-foot-11, 130-pound teen was last seen Thursday around 4 p.m. on the Q train near Central Park.

Meanwhile, police said Monday morning they have found Eliceo Cortez, an autistic 14-year-old boy who went missing Friday from his Brooklyn school.

He is described as being in good health.
