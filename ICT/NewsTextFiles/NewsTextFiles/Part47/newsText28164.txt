
In wake of the second phase of the Jodi Arias murder trial, the convicted boyfriend killer appeared in an Arizona courtroom on Friday, May 16, for a preliminary hearing.

In May 2013, a jury found the 33-year-old guilty of first-degree murder in the ghastly death of her former boyfriend Travis Alexander in his Phoenix home in 2008. However, the jurors failed to reach a unanimous decision on her sentencing. As a result, a retrial is set for Sept. 8 to determine whether she should be sentenced to death, life in prison or life with a chance of release after serving 25 years,  Reuters  reported.

Should the jury deadlock again, then the death penalty will be completely off the table, and Judge Sherry Stephens will decide whether to give Arias life in prison with or without parole.

Medical examiners found that Arias stabbed her ex-boyfriend 27 times, primarily in the back and in the torso and heart. She also slit Alexander's throat from ear to ear, nearly decapitating him, and shot him in the face before she dragged his bloodied corpse to the shower where she left him crumpled over. In total, the killing was done in a little less than two minutes.

Her initial trial garnered lots of media attention and publicity last year. However, this time around, Judge Sherry Stephens has motioned to limit media coverage in order to avoid the publicity around the high profile case. In addition, live video coverage and electronic devices have also been prohibited from the second trial.
