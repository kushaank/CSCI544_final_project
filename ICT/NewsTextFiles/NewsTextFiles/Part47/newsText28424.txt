
Canada gets the rookie cops of 15 Division back this week, but America still has to wait another month.

While Season 5 of the police drama "Rookie Blue" begins Monday (May 19) on originating network Global, ABC's run of the new episodes doesn't start until Thursday, June 19. That means at least another four weeks, ostensibly, before U.S. fans learn the outcome of Detective Sam Swarek's (Ben Bass) shooting at the end of Season 4 -- and it's also agonizing for someone who already knows.

"I'm not happy about that," Missy Peregrym tells Zap2it . As Sam's still devoted ex, Officer Andy McNally, she came clean with him in the ambulance at the end of Season 4 by tearfully telling him, "You're my story." Not only is the aftermath of that moment yet to be known, so is Andy's subsequent interaction with her most recent beau, Officer Nick Collins (Peter Mooney).

"I was definitely frustrated to hear" about the one-month jump in Canadian airings, Peregrym says. "The States are always going to be four episodes behind now. It's so difficult to even do press and publicity, because I don't want to be the one who's giving things away. I can't do interviews and say all these things just for the Canadian side, because it's not like everything stays in Canada.

"It's going to leak through, so basically, I'm only able to talk about the beginning of the season ... and the rest of it will have to play out as it does. I would like to protect it as much as possible."

Peregrym certainly knows social media typically isn't conducive to keeping secrets. That said, she hopes enough surprise is left for "Rookie Blue" fans by the time ABC airs the new stories.

"Understanding the ins and outs of this is not part of my job," she notes, "and it's out of my control anyway. I really don't know how this is going to work, but I'm trusting that everything works out as it should."
