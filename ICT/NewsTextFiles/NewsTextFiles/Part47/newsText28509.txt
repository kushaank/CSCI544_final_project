AUSTIN (KXAN) — LASA High School, Canyon Vista Middle School and Texas Preparatory School topped the lists for Austin’s top 10 schools, according to the non-profit Children at Risk.

For the last five years, Children at Risk has researched and ranked 422 public elementary, middle and high schools from the Austin area. The schools are measured by students’ performances on reading and math standardized tests, graduation rates and improvement in test scores over time.

According to Sanborn, Austin schools generally rank better than all other regions in the state of Texas but that’s not the case for every school.

“There’s still a significant proportion of Austin schools that aren’t measuring up and that’s another focus that’s important to us,” Sanborn said.

Sanborn said the reason Austin schools typically do better is because there’s more affluence in the area.

For the first time, this year Children at risk also took a look at school districts as a whole with Dripping Springs ISD taking the coveted number one spot.
