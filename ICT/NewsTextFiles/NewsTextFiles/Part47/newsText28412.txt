
ATLANTA — The Georgia Supreme Court has reversed a stay of execution for Warren Lee Hill, who murdered another inmate at the state prison in Leesburg in 1990. The court in a 5-2 vote rejected the arguments of Hill’s attorneys that Georgia’s refusal to disclose the source of its lethal drugs was unconstitutional.

In a 33-page majority opinion being released this morning, Presiding Justice P. Harris Hines states that the high court holds that the state law is constitutional and dissolves the interlocutory injunction granted by Tusan.

Justice Robert Benham, who along with Justice Carol Hunstein dissented, recounted the 34-minute execution in Oklahoma of Clayton D. Lockett, who had a fatal heart attack.

Because of the scarcity of lethal drugs available, Georgia does not have that certainty, the dissent opinion states.

“Georgia’s confidential inmate state secret statute does nothing to achieve a high level of certainty. Rather the law has the effect of creating the very secret star chamber-like proceedings in which this State has promised its citizens it would not engage….The fact that some drug providers may be subject to harassment and/or public ridicule and the fact that authorities may find it more difficult to obtain drugs for use in executions are insufficient reasons to forgo constitutional processes in favor of secrecy, especially when the state is carrying out the ultimate punishment.” And assurances from the State that the compounding pharmacy it used was able to produce a high quality execution drug “amount to little more than hollow invocations of ‘trust us,’” the dissent says.

The dissent says that the statute is unconstitutional because Hill’s claims are speculative because the state’s shield law denies him any opportunity to prove they are actual.
