LOWER MAKEFIELD, Pa. — A Trenton man was struck and killed, and his friend was injured by a car on I-95 in Pennsylvania early Sunday morning, police said.

Benjamin Melendez, 30, was a passenger in the car of 26-year-old Levittown, Pa., resident Daniel Raymond when the blue Suzuki Raymond was driving broke down just after midnight, leaving them stuck in the left shoulder of I-95 north, near Exit 49, Pennsylvania State Police said in a statement.

Melendez called a friend to come help him and Raymond, police said. When the friend arrived, she parked on the right shoulder and Melendez began to cross the road, police said.

As he crossed, he was struck by the mirror of a Lexus being driven in the right lane, police said. The vehicle stopped. Raymond saw Melendez sitting upright in the right lane after being hit and ran out to drag him from the road when a Hyundai Sante Fe struck both of them, police said. The Santa Fe stopped as well.

Melendez was killed and Raymond was transported to St. Mary Medical Center in Langhorne, Pa., with unknown injuries, officials said. An update on Raymond’s condition was not available tonight.

Police said there was no alcohol use by the drivers of the Lexus and the Santa Fe. The use of alcohol by Raymond and Melendez is under investigation.
