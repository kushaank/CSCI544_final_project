
A United Parcel Service truck out delivering packages in a Mauldin neighborhood on Monday caught fire.

FOX Carolina spoke with a witness to the blaze who said the flames started shooting out of the truck's engine.

The truck was located near Plum Creek Lane and Miller Road when the fire started.

The witness, Angel Jaramillo, took several photos of the damage, which included charred packages.

Dan Cardillo with UPS public relations said the driver was OK and the company was working with the investigating agency.

"We are also in the process of assessing the extent of the damage to packages on the truck," Cardillo said.  "UPS will contact customers whose packages may have been damaged or destroyed and we will make them whole."
