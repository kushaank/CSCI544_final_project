
PETALING JAYA: Malaysia Airlines is improving its flight security measures by installing new equipment to scan all goods transported by MASkargo.

The equipment and personnel to operate it are to be in place by the middle of next month, according to a circular sent to MASkargo business partners.

The airline’s cargo carrier said it was “investing several million ringgit” on the cargo scanners, which would be deployed in Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Kota Kinabalu and Kuching.

“Additional machines are planned for Labuan, Langkawi, Miri and Bintulu,” MASkargo said in the circular dated April 15 and signed by its CEO Mohd Yunus Idris.

“The screening, applicable to both international and domestic cargo handled at our facilities, will be effective July 1,” it added.

The existing security screening, it said, was carried out via mechanical, physical or other methods approved by the Department of Civil Aviation and in line with the International Civil Aviation Organisation standards. The new technology, it said, was “essential” to meet some of the latest international standards set by the US Transportation Security Administration.

The new machines will be able to screen loose, skidded and containerised cargo up to a maximum gross measurement of 1.6m x 1.6m with a load of up to 2,500kg per piece.

“In cases where cargo such as human tissue and live animals are unable to be screened using X-ray technology, explosives trace detectors will be used instead,” read the circular.

News of this increased security comes in the wake of Flight MH370, which went missing on March 8 with 239 people on board while flying to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur and believed lost in the southern Indian Ocean after mysteriously going off-course.

Among the many questions raised was what exactly was in the cargo hold of the flight, which reportedly included shipments of lithium batteries and mangosteens.

Please wait.
