
Last week, DeSoto told Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office deputies that his two-year-old pit bull named Nyla bit his young child. DeSoto stated he put the dog in a separate part of the house to calm down, but when he opened the door, the dog lunged at him; the owner reportedly then punched the dog in the head.

DeSoto, 33, of Harvey, stated he dragged the dog outside, tied her down, and shot her twice in the back with a bow and arrow. Authorities stated the dog did not die immediately and suffered a slow, lingering death.

He is currently free on $10,000 bond.

DeSoto has been charged with animal cruelty , and in a second unrelated incident the same day was also charged with simple assault against a young man.

Rest in peace Nyla.
