Two Ely residents died and two others were injured in a rollover crash on Nevada 278 south of Carlin, the state Highway Patrol said Monday.

The driver, an unidentified 16-year-old girl and Amy Nardi, 39, died in the Sunday car crash, the NHP said.

Two others, ages 12 and 4, were injured and taken to a hospital.

The crash occurred about 4:45 p.m. Sunday about 30 miles south of Carlin.

The driver, who allowed the car to drive off the west roadway edge onto the dirt shoulder, swerved to the left causing the vehicle to rotate in a counter-clockwise direction, the NHP said.

The Kia overturned, crossed both travel lanes and left the eastbound shoulder. The Kia came to rest in the desert area east of Nevada 278.

The driver and Nardi were not wearing their seat belts, the NHP said.

The crash remains under investigation. Witnesses are asked to call the NHP at 775-753-1111.
