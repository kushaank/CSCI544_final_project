It's been more than six months now since deadly tornadoes tore through the state of Illinois. About two dozen twisters touched down on November 17th last year where one of the hardest hit towns was Washington, in central Illinois.

More than 1,000 homes were damaged or destroyed in the town of about 15,000 people.

The mayor tells us despite the harsh winter, there's more than 600 building permits started.

"Some people have actually moved back into their homes," Manier said. "It's amazing. I continue to compliment our residents on how resilient they really are. It gets me going each and every day to look at these folks who have lost everything, They still smile, they're still encourage and motivated to rebuild."

He says six months later there are still a lot of volunteers coming to help.
