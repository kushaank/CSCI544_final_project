
The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio , concerned about forced power outages during winter, is urging a federal regulator to audit power generatorsâ€™ claimed capabilities.

Doing so â€œwill go a long way in safeguarding the grid in times of extreme weather,â€� PUCO said in comments filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission . The regulator sought comments from stakeholders like PUCO after this past winter wreaked havoc on regional transmission organizations, including PJM Interconnection , which controls electricity flow in Ohio and 12 other states.

Heavy use in January strained PJMâ€™s capacity, prompting it and utilities such as Columbus-based American Electric Power Company Inc. (NYSE:AEP) to issue pleas to customers to lower their thermostats and find other ways to stay warm. Peak demand led to, at times, 22 percent, or 40,000 megawatts, of forced outages for generating capacity, compared with the average rate of 7 percent. Eight of the 10 highest winter electricity demands in PJMâ€™s 87-year history occurred in January, as did the highest peak load ever, at 141,846 megawatts, on Jan. 7.

Most of the outages were caused by faulty equipment â€“ routine equipment breakdowns, failure to operate in cold weather, fuel-supply issues. That, coupled with more dependency on natural gas, whose prices were high in the winter, for electric generation â€œresulted in significantly higher wholesale electricity prices,â€� PJM Executive Vice President Michael Kormos said in a FERC filing outlining winter weather issues.

PUCO says increasing outage rates are proof that generating units aren't being properly maintained to ensure that they work during peak demand, which is why it is calling for PJM to institute a claimed capability auditing program. The only regional transmission organization that uses this process is ISO New England Inc., which serves six Northeastern states.
