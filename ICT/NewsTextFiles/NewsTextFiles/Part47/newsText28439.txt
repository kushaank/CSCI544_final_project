
VERNON COUNTY, Wis. (WEAU) -- Community members voiced their concerns over a proposal for bypasses in one area county.

A meeting was held Monday at the Vernon Inn in Viroqua.

A proposal from the WisDOT would build a bypass along Highway 14/61 from Cut A Cross road to Tristate Road in Westby.

It would also build another bypass along Highway 14/61 from Springville Road to County T/Wisconsin 27/Wisconsin 82 in Viroqua.

The DOT said the proposal came about, because it looked like traffic counts were going up 10 years ago.

The DOT said right now it looks like the plan isn’t going to pan out the way they thought it would.

However, that doesn’t mean some businesses aren’t concerned.

“As business owners we try to make decisions based on long term, and when something like this is looming over our heads, then it’s a factor for us,” said Sleepy Hollow Group owner LaVon Felton.

“With input from the locals and the businesses and the whole community, we can reevaluate, and decide if this is a priority project or something that should be put on the back burner and review later,” said WisDOT economic development officer Brad Basten.

The DOT is expecting to review the proposal in next the next few weeks to decide whether to keep it in the budget.

However, it said the proposal probably won’t be permanently shelved, because all of the communities are growing.
