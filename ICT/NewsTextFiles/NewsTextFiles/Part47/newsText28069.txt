
Storm chasers in the US state of Wyoming have captured incredible pictures of a super cell thunderstorm , also known as a rotating thunderstorm.

The incredible image was captured yesterday by storm chasers Basehunters , a storm chasing team with members based in Oklahoma, New York and Colorado.

Basehunters was founded by chasers Colt Forney, Kevin Rolfs, Scott Peake, and Isaac Pato to share their chase photography and videography with the world.

A supercell is a thunderstorm that is characterized by the presence of a mesocyclone: a deep, persistently rotating updraft (that cylindrical formation you can see in the picture). They are not common, and can be very destructive, although this one appears to have formed over open plain.
