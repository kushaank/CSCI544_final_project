
A strike that would have shut down Kaiser Permanente pharmacies statewide Monday was postponed as hospital officials and union representatives negotiated.

Some 1,430 pharmacists working for Kaiser facilities across Southern California planned to strike if a deal wasn’t reached, said Robin Borden, president of the Guild for Professional Pharmacists. Instead, talks continued on through Sunday night.

But, she noted, that didn’t happen.

Kaiser Permanente has more than 40 hospitals statewide. Its Southern California facility locations include Woodland Hills, Panorama City, Hollywood, Downey, Baldwin Park, West Los Angeles, Fontana and Ontario.

If a strike were to occur, patients would be advised to order prescriptions online or visit local drugstores. A statement from Kaiser to its members said all Southern California pharmacies will hold normal business hours.
