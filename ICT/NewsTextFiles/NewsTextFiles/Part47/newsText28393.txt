SEATTLE -- A Seattle lawyer who pleaded guilty to raping five women at massage parlors has been sentenced to 25 years in prison.

Danford Grant pleaded guilty May 7 to third-degree rape charges as his trial was beginning on first-degree rape charges that could have brought a life sentence.

Grant was formally sentenced Monday in King County Superior Court.

The 49-year-old is a married father of three and former partner in Seattle law firm Bailey Onsager who once worked in the Seattle city attorney's office. He admitted raping the five women in 2011 and 2012.
