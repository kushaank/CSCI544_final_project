BATH, Maine — The victim of a domestic violence assault was arrested Saturday night for operating under the influence after fleeing the man who allegedly punched her in the nose.

Officers responded just after 10 p.m. Saturday to Old Brunswick Road after neighbors reported an argument on the street. They allegedly found James Drum, 30, of Bath standing outside his truck, Lt. Robert Savary of the Bath Police Department said Monday.

Officers then located his girlfriend, 22, also of Bath, driving on Old Bath Road, and noticed blood on her nose and hands.

The woman told police Drum had assaulted her, and that she fled on foot and then picked up a car at a relative’s house. Officers arrested her for operating under the influence.

They then arrested Drum for domestic violence assault.

The woman, who did not require medical treatment, was released from the police station and is scheduled to appear in West Bath District Court on July 8.

Drum was released on $500 unsecured bail and is due in West Bath District Court on June 3.
