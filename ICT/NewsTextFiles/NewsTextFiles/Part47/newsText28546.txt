
HAVERFORD, Pa. (AP) — A commencement speaker on Sunday blasted college students as “immature” and “arrogant” for protesting another speaker who then decided to withdraw.

William Bowen, former president of Princeton University, used his commencement speech at Haverford College outside Philadelphia to criticize students who campaigned against Robert Birgeneau, former chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley.

Birgeneau is among several commencement speakers who canceled their appearances this spring amid student protests.

Birgeneau, who was also supposed to receive an honorary degree from Haverford, refused those demands and others in a terse email.

He called Birgeneau’s withdrawal a defeat for the school.

His remarks drew a standing ovation.
