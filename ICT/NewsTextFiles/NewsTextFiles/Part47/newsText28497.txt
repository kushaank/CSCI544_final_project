Then-New York Times managing editor Jill Abramson attended the 2010 Matrix Awards presented by the New York Women in Communications at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on April 19, 2010.

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. >> In her first public appearance since her dismissal from The New  York Times, former executive editor Jill Abramson compared herself to a  new college graduate: "scared but also a little excited."

"What's  next for me? I don't know. So I'm in exactly the same boat as many of  you," Abramson told the Class of 2014 at Wake Forest University's  graduation ceremony Monday morning. The audience replied with laughter  and applause.

The Times announced last week that Abramson was  being replaced by managing editor Dean Baquet. Publisher Arthur  Sulzberger Jr. has denied reports that Abramson's dismissal had to do  with complaints over unequal pay or the company's treatment of women.  Instead, he cited Abramson's newsroom management style.

In her  speech, Abramson talked briefly about her time at the helm of The New  York Times but did not directly address her dismissal. She said that she  didn't want the "media circus" following her to take attention away  from the graduates.

"It was the honor of my life to lead the newsroom," she said, citing the risks Times journalists take to report the news.

"Sure,  losing a job you love hurts, but the work I revere -- journalism that  holds powerful institutions and people accountable -- is what makes our  democracy so resilient. This is the work I will remain very much a part  of."

Abramson said students had asked her whether she'd remove her tattoo of The Times' 'T.'

"Not a chance!" she said.

Abramson  also invoked the memory of her father, who said it meant more to him  that she and her siblings dealt with their setbacks than their success.  She encouraged graduates to show people what they're made of when they  feel the sting of losses.
