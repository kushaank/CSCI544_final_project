
The man who did more than any other to influence the entire art of cinematography through a single film was Gordon Willis. The Godfather broke every classical “rule” in the book, and much of its impact can be attributed to the unusual but intuitive approach Willis took to photographing the film. In many scenes Willis used as little illumination as possible. In doing so he invited us to lean forward, to peer into the eyes of characters with blackened souls. We may have recoiled when we saw what was truly in the heart of Michael Corleone, but we could never look away. Willis painted with shadow, and for it earned a loving nickname that was better suited to Michael Corleone: the Prince of Darkness.

Now Gordon Willis has died at the age of 82. A cause of death has not been released, but Willis’ passing has been confirmed by American Society of Cinematographers president Richard Crudo.

His cinematography for Woody Allen’s Manhattan redefined how we see New York City; it is difficult to imagine anyone who has seen the film not wanting the city to look in real life as it does on the screen in the astounding black and white tones captured by Willis. Working with Woody Allen, Willis truly showed his range, also shooting films such as Annie Hall, Interiors, Zelig, Stardust Memories, Broadway Danny Rose, and The Purple Rose Of Cairo.

And here’s a much more in-depth conversation with Willis, an hour-long talk with the Craft Truck webcast.
