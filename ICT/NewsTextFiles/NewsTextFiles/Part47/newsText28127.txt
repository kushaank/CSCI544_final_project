Jill Hansen has been charged with the attempted murder of Elizabeth Conklin, 73, who was hospitalized following the Wednesday afternoon incident. Hansen, 30, followed Conklin to her condo's parking garage, then waited till the older woman exited her car to hit her, police say, per Hawaii News Now and ABC News . Witnesses say she then backed up as if to hit her again, but was stopped by a bystander who used a crowbar to break Hansen's back window, Gawker reports. Hansen then fled, but was arrested later that day; she's being held on $1 million bail.

Conklin—perhaps to her benefit—doesn't remember much. "I parked in my normal parking place, and I got out and all of a sudden I woke up in an ambulance," she says. It's not clear what caused the attack; reports cite road rage, though Conklin says she suspects Hansen wanted to steal her car. Hansen has a line of wetsuits, and a Facebook post from the day of the attack says she's "becoming a professional" surfer. The Daily Mail reports Hansen is well known for her erratic driving, and Radar reports that her father has had a restraining order on her since February 8, 2012; more on that here .
