NORTON SHORES, Mich. (WZZM) - Some recent graduates from GVSU's College of Education are getting help encouraging students to fall in love with reading.

Members of the school arrived at Mona Shores Lincoln Park Elementary wheeling in large tubs of new books.  The gift was for 5th grade teacher Tim Zinger.

Zinger and his students were surprised with a variety of age-appropriate books, both fiction and non-fiction.  Zinger is one of six West Michigan teachers in their first year of teaching after graduating from GVSU.  The Our Michigan Literacy Project is working to build classroom libraries.

Zinger says he uses his own money to purchase books for his classroom. The surprise gift means he can do less of that.

We hear that a first year teacher from GVSU who teaches in Newaygo County also received books today.
