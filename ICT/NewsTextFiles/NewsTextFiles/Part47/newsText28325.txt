
WASHINGTON (AP) — China denies it all. But the U.S. says China's military has been spying on a number of major U.S. companies.

Five Chinese military officers have been charged with hacking into U.S. companies. The Justice Department says China targeted makers of nuclear and solar technology, stealing confidential business information, sensitive trade secrets and internal communications for competitive advantage.

The alleged targets include Alcoa, Westinghouse Electric, Allegheny Technologies, U.S. Steel and SolarWorld, along with the United Steelworkers Union.

The Justice Department says the grand jury indictment should be a national "wake-up call" about cyber intrusions.

SolarWorld has long accused China of unfair trade practices. It says it's troubled by the allegations but no customer information has been breached. Alcoa says it believes no sensitive data has been compromised.

China's Foreign Ministry says the accusations are "fabricated." It's suspending cooperation with the U.S. in a joint cybersecurity working group and warns of further retaliation "as the situation evolves."
