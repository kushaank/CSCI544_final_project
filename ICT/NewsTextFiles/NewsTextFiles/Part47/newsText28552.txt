
Sen. Claire McCaskill held her first roundtable Monday on ending the sexual assault crisis on college campuses. One in five women will be sexually assaulted by the time she leaves college, according to one widely-cited survey . But to solve the crisis, we first have to understand it, and the senator admitted that current statistics are woefully inadequate to describe the problem. "I don't think anybody knows the data is even there, getting past the first problem that the data is not reliable," she said.

McCaskill seems convinced that universities are finally ready to deal with the campus rape crisis — most of the 450 colleges McCaskill sent surveys to have responded positively. "I've seen some minimal pushback about resources, and we're going to look at the costs of doing an annual climate survey," she told The Wire. "But I think with this problem and with the attention it is finally receiving — which is appropriate, given the seriousness of the problem — I think universities are going to be reluctant to shirk away from finding out exactly what is the problem on their campus. Because clearly the Clery data doesn't tell us now ... they're not even reporting it the same from institution to institution."
