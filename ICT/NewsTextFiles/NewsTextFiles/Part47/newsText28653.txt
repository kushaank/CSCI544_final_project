
U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Janesville, laments an inner city culture of men who won't work. I would submit there is a culture at the other end of the wealth scale that is just as pernicious.

I see certain hyper-wealthy Americans and corporations valuing profit above all else. They don't seem to care that the workers who actually create their wealth make so little that they depend on food stamps to feed their families. Thank of Wal-Mart.

Ryan derides those on government aid as being part of a "culture of dependency." I see a culture of dependency among those at the other end of the wealth scale who enjoy the benefits of our nation without paying taxes, who benefit from endless government subsidies, and who went unpunished when their illegal activities caused the loss of trillions of dollars of wealth for all Americans in 2007.

If we are going to deride those who take advantage of our government's largesse, let's be fair and include all the guilty parties. The un-wealthy should not bear this burden alone.

Hiding behind the former president's name won't get you anywhere with me.

Again, no names provided. I stand by what I said before and label you equally as silly.

Lots of my banker pals made a killing selling junk bonds mislabeled as high grade bonds. Some even made bets that they would default. Obama gave them a pass. He knows better. What comes around goes around.

Excellent letter Karen- you are absolutely spot on!

If the writer knows of wealthy people who don't pay taxes and individuals who committed crimes that went unpunished precipitating the financial crisis then I wish she would name them. Then perhaps we could do something about them. The silly logic in this letter serves no one.
