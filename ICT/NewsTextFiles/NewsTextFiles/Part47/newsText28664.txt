The Texas State Fire Marshal's Office released the Firefighter Fatality Investigation Report today, giving more answers into why two Bryan firefighters were killed in a fire back in February of 2013.

The teams did not take an available Thermal Imaging Camera into the Knights of Columbus Hall, even though one was available. They also did not take tools in to attempt to pull the ceiling to inspect the concealed space.

The report also states that situation details were not consistently communicated to the Command so that fire location, spread, control progress, and other vital information could be monitored and factored into the decision-making process.

There were no indications that there was anyone in the building. The size, location, and intensity of the fire may have supported the decision to actual enter the building to put out the fire, according to the report.

One key finding could have made a life or death difference for Lt. Eric Wallace, who was one of two firefighters killed in the fire. While Lt. Wallace indicated that he was low on air, and could not get out, he did not use the term "Mayday."

The fire team was also staffed less than the national standard recommendations, and though there was more support available, it was not requested, nor was it part of the mutual aid agreement.

Lastly, the incident safety officer was assigned to a fixed position at the rear of the building. The ISO may also serve as a medical officer. Having the ISO at a fixed location limited his ability to monitor fire conditions on all sides of the structure, according to the report.
