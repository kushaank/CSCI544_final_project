
CHANDIGARH: The tug of war between  Harmohan Dhawan and  Sanjay Tandon to take credit over the issue of giving relaxation to  traders for sealing commercial establishments spilled out in the open on Monday as the two BJP leaders made contradicting statements.

Dhawan told mediapersons at 3.30pm that he met deputy commissioner-cum-estate officer Mohammad Shayin, who assured to give one month to traders to regularise their violations by opting for conversion. Three hours later, the BJP issued a press release, saying party president Sanjay Tandon met the DC on the issue and was assured no action would be taken for 15 days. However, the DC refused that he set any time frame for the relief.

Dhawan said, "I have talked to the DC and he assured me that affected traders can apply within the time frame of one month for conversion of property. What does it mean? I am fully confirmed and stick to what I said before the media."

Tandon said, "I had talked to the DC on the sealing issue on Sunday night and he assured to give time to the traders to act upon. This is a matter of fact because after getting assurance from DC, traders had come to thank me also."
