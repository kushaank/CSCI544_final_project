INDIANAPOLIS – Under an agreement reached with the Indiana Attorney General’s Office, customers of a Fort Wayne-based snow removal company who did not receive services they paid for are set to receive restitution and the company has also agreed not to do business in Indiana.

Brian Thornton, doing business as Fort Wayne Snow Removal Corporation, 215 Snow Removal Corporation, Fort Wayne Snow Removal Corp., and 317 Snow Removal Corporation reached a settlement with Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller’s office after they failed to perform snow removal services to paying customers.

According to a complaint filed in Allen County, 17 consumers made payments ranging from $75 – $538 totaling $3,649 upfront for snow removal and did not receive any or all of the services.

As part of the agreement, the defendants do not intend to provide snow removal services and will fully refund for services not provided within 60 days.

Zoeller thanked Deputy Attorney General Luminita Nodit for her work on the case and the Northern Indiana Better Business Bureau for their hard work on this case.  Tips on home improvement and other scams can be found at www.IndianaConsumer.com .
