
ARTEMUS, Ky. (WYMT) - Knox County Sheriff's Deputies are searching for two people who broke into a grocery store and stole items.  It was caught on surveillance video.

It happened at the Eagle Mart in Artemus late Saturday night.

Surveillance video shows two men in the store for 15 minutes.

The men came in through the crawl space, ripped out the duct work, and cut a hole in the wall to avoid setting off the alarm.

They obviously had some thought behind it in what they were going to do.  They posed a lookout while they were in there, had one looking out while they other did work.  They definitely had a game plan going on," said Drew Wilson, Knox County Sheriff's Deputy.

Owners say the burglars stole tobacco, cigarettes, food, and 700 dollars from a quarter machine.

I was really shocked and hurt because we've been good to a lot of people here, and for them to come in and do this to us, kind of hurt," said Heather Hurst.

Hurst says the break in also damaged the building and water lines.  She cannot run part of the store until repairs are made.  She says that hurts business.

"It hurts a lot not to have that because a lot of people come in here for lunch and expect like hot dogs and I can't do it," she said.

She hopes to return to normal soon, and hopes to see those responsible in jail.

Knox County Sheriff's Deputies say they do have suspects.
