
A man suspected of being under the influence of drugs was injured Sunday after he drove into an unoccupied pickup truck, according to the Trempealeau County Sheriffâ€™s Department.

Neil R. Fullarton, 19, of Kaukauna, Wis., was southbound on state Hwy. 93 near the intersection of County Road E in Elk Creek about 8:20 p.m. when he crossed into the northbound lane of traffic, then drove head-on into the unoccupied pickup truck parked on the northbound shoulder, the department said.
