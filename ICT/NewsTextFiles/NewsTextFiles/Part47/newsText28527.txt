
COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Medical students at Ohio State University have formally recognized those who donated their bodies to the school for research.

The med students gathered Sunday in Columbus to honor the memories of the 202 people who willed their bodies to the OSU Division of Anatomy last year.

Students lit candles for each donor, read their names and gave flowers to family members. A montage of photos from families and thank-you messages from students played on a screen. About 500 family members and students attended.
