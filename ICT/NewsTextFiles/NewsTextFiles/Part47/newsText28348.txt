
Well, some motorists are getting hit with a big fine for missing a small toll, or at least that's what they thought.

That's why Stephen Burchett of Seffner was so surprised when he got a citation in the mail asking for $57.00 from Toll Enforcement, LLC -- $7 for the missed toll, and $50 more tacked on for a late fee.

"They have taken out most of the people that you would pay the toll to, so if you don't have a SunPass you get a notice in the mail," Burchett said.

So when Burchett got an official looking notice from Toll Enforcement, LLC he thought he should pay it.

"It's got a state of Florida logo and an LLC, so I thought it was pretty much legit. We were getting ready to go down and get a cashier's check at the bank," said Burchett.

But the company is not listed on the Florida Division of Corporations website and the state is not doing any business with it.

"Toll Enforcement, LLC is not a company that the Florida Department of Transportation recognizes," said Chad Huff, a spokesperson for Florida's Turnpike Enterprise. The agency has now issue a fraud alert for consumers.

Investigators with the U.S. Postal Inspection Service are working with Miami-Dade Police, since the return address for Toll Enforcement, LLC comes back to a mail forwarding company in Miami.

The owner of USAbox.com is working with law enforcement to track down the owner of Toll Enforcement, LLC.

Detectives tell FOX 13 since it's an open investigation, there's little they can say, but confirm that close to a thousand people have reported the scam.

Florida's Turnpike Enterprise says motorists should know that if they miss a toll, they will always have at least 30 days to pay it without a late fee, and they will also be provided with the day, time and photo of the missed toll.
