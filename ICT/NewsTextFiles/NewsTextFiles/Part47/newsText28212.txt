
Barneys New York could become a tenant at an expanded Bal Harbour Shops.

At a recent workshop hosted by the luxury shopping center at the Sea View Hotel, Marc Perlowitz of Barneys New York said his company is possibly interested in adding its store to the Bal Harbour Shops.

Currently, the Bal Harbour Shops is planning to expand the mall to 350,000 square feet of retail space, including 250,000 square feet of additional or expanded specialty department store space, and at least 20 specialty retail boutiques, along with a luxury theater, a multi-purpose community plaza along Collins Avenue and multiple locations for public green space. At the same time, Bal Harbour Shops would build a new, 60,799 square-foot church for its neighbor, the Church by the Sea, set to be located behind village hall.

However, the village council would need to approve the expansion. The $300 million expansion would be completed as early as 2018. No word yet on when the expansion would be up for approval.
