
Flames were still visible this morning after a massive fire broke out at a Bossier Parish business Sunday afternoon.

The business, Ark-La-Tex Pallet Sales, is in the 4100 block of Bellevue Road in Haughton, about six miles off Highway 80.

Fire officials say about 80,000 wooden pallets caught on fire, and owner J.T. Rankin says that translates into about $250,000 worth of damage.

It took seven fire departments to get it under control, and keep it from spreading to nearby woods.

But Rankin, whose owned the business for 33 years, says it could have been worse, and he credits firefighters for their quick action.

"The good Lord will take care of you, He won't put anymore on you than you can bear," Rankin says. "Sometimes the wagon just gets a little heavy. We're getting ready to go in here and order some saws and air compresser and we're gonna put this thing back together and get back to work."

He adds that a major fire that broke out at Ark-La-Tex Pallet Sales years ago was the result of a large incinerator on the property.

The Louisiana State Fire Marshal is still investigating the exact cause of the fire.
