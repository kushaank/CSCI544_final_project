
The picture shows the force of the impact. The girl's shoes are lying in the road and her backpack was thrown to the top of the school bus.

The bill would place cameras next to school bus stop arms to take pictures of anyone who drives around a stopped school bus.  Those pictures would go to law enforcement.

Currently, South Carolina law enforcement typically must see the violation in person to ticket the driver.

The bill will go before the full Senate Transportation Committee on Wednesday.

"Unfortunately, many times it takes an unfortunate situation to help galvanize the support that we need," Alexander said.

WYFF News 4 Investigates has learned the girl, who is a freshman at Gaffney High School, is still in the hospital.
