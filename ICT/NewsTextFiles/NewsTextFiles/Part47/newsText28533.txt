
LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — Authorities are searching for a 20-year-old UC Berkeley sophomore who has been missing for a week.

Young Douglas Jr. left his Baldwin Hills home on foot May 9 with no mention of where he was going, according to his family.

His loved ones tracked his debit card and found he used it twice. The card was last used in Fullerton on Mother’s Day.

“This is just totally out of character. He was gone for his father’s birthday, he was gone for Mother’s Day, these are very important dates that we celebrate as a family,” Douglas Jr.’s mother, Ofy Douglas, said.

Los Angeles police told the family Douglas Jr. had contact with a Santa Ana police officer May 12. He asked how to get to San Diego from the Santa Ana train station.

On Monday, the family was told the man’s backpack and laptop were found in the San Mateo Campground in San Clemente.

“I am worried about his safety. Mostly, I am worried that some harm may come his way. We love him, we want him home,” Douglas said.

Douglas said her son took the last semester off at UC Berkeley because of stress. She’s worried someone may have taken advantage of his weak mental state.

Douglas Jr. was described as black, 5 feet 10 inches tall, 147 pounds, with black hair and brown eyes. He was wearing a dark-colored outfit with black shoes.

Anyone with information on the man’s whereabouts was asked to contact LAPD Missing Persons Unit Det. Kristin Merrill at (213) 996-1800.
