
When he’s not roaring his way through Metallica shows, James Hetfield likes to take to the great outdoors and hunt. That hobby has earned him a gig narrating an eight-episode History Channel series called ‘The Hunt,’ beginning June 8 at 10 p.m. ET.

The program chronicles the annual controlled hunt in Alaska for Kodiak brown bears, which can grow to 12-feet tall and some 1,500 pounds. This tradition goes back centuries to the region’s early Alutiiq people, though its now strictly regulated by the state department of fish and game .

Each year, thousands of sportsmen apply to participate in the Kodiak Island hunt, with fewer than 500 lottery-system passes handed out. These events typically last 10 days, and hunters spend the bulk of that time living off the land with only the supplies they’ve brought along.

This TV appearance caps a busy period for Hetfield, even as Metallica works on a new album. He appeared last week at the ‘ Acoustic 4 A Cure ‘ benefit and then took part in the San Francisco Giants’ second annual Metallica Night . As for that forthcoming studio effort , Metallica hopes to start recording it in the fall. Their last album was ‘ Death Magnetic ,’ released six years ago.
