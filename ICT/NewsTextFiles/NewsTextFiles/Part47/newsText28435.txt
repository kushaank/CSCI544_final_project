The tentative $2,211,128,982  spending plan is $8,575,681 lower than the current budget.

Revenues have grown, and officials said the operating budget rose slightly, fueled by increases in public safety spending.

In order to handle the increased workload in the justice system, the budget will add three new court divisions, market–based salary increases for deputies and probation officers, new resources for prosecution and defense, and increases in the number of adult and juvenile probation staff. There are additional expenditures for detention operations in the jails as the inmate population continues to climb.

As the economy recovers, the county is cautiously optimistic about revenue growth, officials said. Maricopa County is estimating growth in sales and vehicle licenses taxes between 4.5 percent and 6 percent.  Property taxes are expected to grow by $32.5 million, but the tax levy will be $50 million below the property-tax level prior to recessionary reductions in property values. The county will be $162.9 million or 26.9 percent below the maximum levy.

The budget also restored structural balance to the general fund. This means that reoccurring revenues exceed reoccurring expenditures.  Reserves and contingency funds are included for when an economic downturn occurs.
