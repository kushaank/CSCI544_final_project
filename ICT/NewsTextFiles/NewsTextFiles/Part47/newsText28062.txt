Since Tuesday Eric Ortner has his wife have been hunting for their two year old Boston Terrier – Buddy, one of six missing dogs.

Now they’ve made a  fundraising page that’s already generated over 2 thousand dollars – to help cover the costs of posters, gas, wage loss and pet detective services.

Today they also made a Faceook group called the Brookswood Six – which Ortner hopes will get their message out.

Ortner and the others are continuing to search the area but hope someone will come forward with more information.

This sort of crime really shows 2 things about the perpetrator(s). They are as ignorant as all get out and they have absolutely no empathy for a fellow human being. The lack of empathy is the most concerning of all. If these sort of people are the future of Canadian society we have no hope. I hope they get all these dogs back to their families.
