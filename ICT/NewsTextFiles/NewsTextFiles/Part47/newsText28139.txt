It is a personal victory for State Rep. Alicia Reese. A close friend of Reese’s mother fell ill and moved into Haddon Hall. She cherished her time there, and wanted everyone to enjoy the rest of their days, as well.

"I've made a whole lot of friends. In fact, I believe the entire building. All my friends,” Whitfield said.
