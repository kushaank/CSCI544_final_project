While I visited only three places on Saturday, I learned some skills that will help me on the rest of the Michigan’s Best Taco search , including how to be polite when ordering food.

This Michigan’s Best search, I decided to learn a new skill: Spanish We've been asking restaurant owners, servers and managers to teach me a little bit.

The lessons have been great, ranging from how to order food to dating advice. I'm looking forward to expanding my vocabulary.

Michigan's Best Spanish Lesson 12: Hello, my friend. Pablo Maldonado from Pablo's Panaderia in Lansing teaches Fritz Klug some Spanish during the Michigan's Best Taco search.

Carlos Gutierrez from El Oasis in Lansing  taught me how to invite my friends to his taco truck.
