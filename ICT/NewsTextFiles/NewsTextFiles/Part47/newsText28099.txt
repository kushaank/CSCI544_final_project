
John Adam Greene, 29, is scheduled for a bail hearing Tuesday.

A Hamilton man accused of abducting and sexually assaulting a child Saturday has turned himself in after a two-day police search.

John Adam Greene, 29, surrendered to police at Central Station Monday afternoon.

Earlier, police said they were using all of their resources to find Greene after the alleged kidnapping and attack.

"I'm OK, just scaredâ€¦we are scared inside of our house," said neighbour Laura Klinaku, who has three young boys.

Residents of an apartment complex on Sanford Avenue said a girl, under the age of 10, was allegedly attacked inside the building.

Police said the incident happened around 3:45 p.m. Saturday. By Sunday, Staff Sergeant George Narozniak said the child and family were safe, but a  suspect was still on the loose.

Narozniak wouldn't specify the age or gender of the child, saying police needed to protect the victim's identity.

He wouldn't say where the alleged assault and abduction unfolded, if the child was alone, or how police identified a  suspect, citing the ongoing investigation.

On Sunday afternoon, a police forensics van was parked at the complex while detectives investigated. Several neighbours in the area recognized an image of Greene after police released his photo.

"I (saw)  him smoking at the back door two months ago," said Maryan Madobe, 47.

Madobe, who has three young children, was outside with two other mothers. They were worried because many kids play in the area.

"It's a shock. We couldn't sleep last night," said Salado Muhumed, 26. "We all wish for a happy ending."

Greene is charged with abduction, aggravated sexual assault, sexual interference, assault causing bodily harm and threatening death.

He is scheduled for a bail hearing Tuesday.
