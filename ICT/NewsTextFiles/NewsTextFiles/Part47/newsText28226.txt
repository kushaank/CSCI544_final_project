
The omnibus legislation, commonly referred to as the farm bill, includes several pieces of legislation that will benefit Missouri's beef cattle industry, according to MCA Executive Vice President Mike Deering.

The legislation, which was handled by Representative Casey Guernsey in the House and originally sponsored by Senator Brian Munzlinger, would extend the equine activity liability waiver to include livestock activities in the instance that an accident occurs. Additionally, the omnibus bill includes increasing the hauling limits for livestock from 80,000 pounds to 85,500 pounds.

SB 506 also will allow Missouri beef producers to vote in a checkoff referendum if an enhancement is proposed by the Missouri Beef Industry Council.
