
Professional surfer and model Jill Hansen has been charged with attempted murder amid allegations she deliberately ran over an elderly woman in Hawaii. The sportswoman stands accused of trying to kill 73-year-old Elizabeth Conklin outside the alleged victim's home in Waikiki on Wednesday (14May14).   According to police, Hansen was spotted reversing her car after initially hitting Conklin and attempting to ram her again as she lay on the ground, unconscious, before driving off.   The 30 year old, who owns her own line of swimsuits, was tracked down by cops and she is now being held on $1 million (£625,000) bail.   Investigators have yet to reveal a possible motive for Hansen's alleged actions.
