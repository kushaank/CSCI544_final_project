ANCHORAGE, Alaska  — An Alaska man accidentally shot himself in the head  — and treated the wound for five days with antibiotic ointment Neosporin instead of seeking medical care, reports dailymail.co.uk.

State troopers say the gun went off as James Doppler, 47, was handling it last weekend, and his girlfriend urged him to go the hospital but he refused, thinking the ointment would be treatment enough, the report said. But  things took a turn for the worse and he went to a doctor.

"Investigation revealed (the man) had shot himself in the head on (Saturday) while negligently handling a firearm," troopers said in a statement. "(He) did not seek medical attention until (Thursday)."

He's expected to make a full recovery, the report said.
