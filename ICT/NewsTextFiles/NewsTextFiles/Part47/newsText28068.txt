
DOTHAN, Ala. (AP) - A jury in southeast Alabama has found a Tennessee man guilty of human trafficking and giving drugs to an underage girl.

The Dothan Eagle reports that the jury Houston County returned the guilty verdicts on Thursday against 28-year-old Santiago Alonso. He was convicted of first-degree human trafficking and felony distribution of drugs to a minor.

Authorities have said the escape of a girl from a Dothan motel room resulted in his arrest in the summer of 2013. The girl told police she had been held against her will, forced to take drugs and forced to prostitute herself.

The victim testified that Alonso used a website to prostitute her after she said he picked her up in Mississippi and then took her to Memphis and then Dothan, where she escaped.
