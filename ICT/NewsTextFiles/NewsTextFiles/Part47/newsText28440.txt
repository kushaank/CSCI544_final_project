
SALINE — What started out as a parent’s worst nightmare has paved the way for a man to help others involved in similar situations.

David Cooke, founder of 100 Pedals, came to Saline May 13 to speak to concerned community members, faculty and staff about addiction issues facing the community. Cooke told his story, which involved his 26-year-old son, Brandon, who became addicted to heroin.

Cooke is the founder of 100 Pedals, an organization that aims to help support parents of addicts. He told his own story involving Brandon, who is now more than 240 days sober and out of jail, and how that addiction affected Cooke as well as other members of the family. Originally from the Detroit area, Cooke travels throughout the U.S. telling his story and helping support parents whose children are dealing with similar issues.

Brandon’s story began while he was a young teenager when he began smoking marijuana. Later, Brandon became addicted to Oxycotin and eventually to heroin.

Cooke said the low point was when he received a phone call from his daughter in 2009, who said that Brandon was in jail. At first, he became convinced that the only way to help was to have Brandon move in with him in Arizona. However, he soon realized that wasn’t the answer as Brandon began stealing from him to get money to buy drugs.

Eventually, Cooke realized that he could not ride the emotional rollercoaster with his son anymore and had to let go. After he realized that he needed to take care of himself and set a good example for Brandon to be there for his son during moments of clarity, Cooke vowed to ride his bicycle at least an hour a day for 100 days. Throughout this process, he began to learn to practice detachment, gentleness and peace toward his son.

Cooke fielded questions from audience members that ranged from how the district can get parents involved earlier in the social/emotional wellness of their children to how to get the community involved.

“The challenge is that we’re so busy being parents that we sometimes forget to be parents,” he said.

As far as getting the community involved, Cooke said there comes a point in time when a community needs a group of parents to come forward and share their stories. People end up wanting to hear more about it because they don’t want that to happen to their child.

Saline does have some parents who are willing to come forward and tell their story such as Kimberly Ray, whose son Johnny Strawbridge died in 2013 of a heroin overdose. Ray has been active in Saline Community Addiction Task Force as well as formed her own group to bring awareness of the heroin epidemic to the community.

Cooke said only about 1 percent of moms and dads who are dealing with addiction come out in the open and talk about it.

Cooke admits was not involved in his child’s activities because he had to work full time during the day and was studying for his master’s degree at night. He was not able to go to his parent-teacher conferences and remembers his son’s guidance counselor telling him that fathers need to be involved.
