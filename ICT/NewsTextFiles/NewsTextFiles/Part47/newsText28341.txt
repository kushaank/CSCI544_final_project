Attorney General Eric Holder announces the indictment of five Chinese military members on cyber espionage charges. Rough Cut (no reporter narration).

WASHINGTON - The U.S. accused Chinese military officials of hacking into several U.S. enterprises to steal trade secrets and intellectual property in an indictment to be made public Monday, two senior federal law enforcement officials said.

It is the first time the U.S. has charged a state actor in a criminal cyber espionage case.

Federal law enforcement sources said the Chinese hackers, using military and intelligence resources, downloaded massive amounts of industrial information, including strategic plans, from U.S. businesses, including some located in western Pennsylvania. The two senior law enforcement officials who are knowledgeable about the case said they were not authorized to speak publicly before the announcement.

Attorney General Eric Holder is scheduled to announce the indictment, billed as a national security case, at 10 a.m. at the Justice Department.
