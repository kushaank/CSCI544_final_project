
ANN ARBOR, Mich.--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Last week, Lawrence Technological University awarded Duo Security CEO        and co-founder Dug Song with the title of Innovator of the Year.        Announced at a reception on May 15, Song was chosen from nearly 50        nominees for his numerous significant contributions to the information        security industry.

Created in 2005, the Leaders & Innovators program was developed by        Lawrence Tech to recognize Michigan business executives leading the top        industries that are expected to be key to Michigan’s economic future -        one of those being the technology sector.

Song has a long history of leading successful products and companies        striving to solve modern information security problems. Currently, Song        is CEO and co-founder of Duo Security, an information security company        that provides a cloud-based two-factor authentication solution for small        to large enterprise organizations worldwide. Using innovative        technology, Duo Security’s out-of-band authentication effectively        protects against account takeover while providing an intuitive user        experience.

As a privately-held company, Duo Security’s investors include Google        Ventures, True Ventures, Resonant Venture Partners, and Radar Partners.        Song co-founded Duo Security after spending seven years as Chief        Security Architect at Arbor Networks. Arbor Networks is an Ann        Arbor-headquartered company founded in 2000, stemming from research        conducted at the University of Michigan that was eventually funded by        the U.S. Defense Agency Research Projects Administration (DARPA).

Song is also recognized for building the first commercial network        anomaly detection system that was acquired by NFR Security, a leader in        real-time threat prevention (acquired by Check Point Software        Technologies, specializing in enterprise firewall, consumer Internet        security and VPN markets). And before that, he managed security in the        world's largest production Kerberos environment at the University of        Michigan.

More of Song’s contributions to the security community include popular        open source (OpenSSH, libdnet, dsniff), distributed filesystem (NFSv4)        and operating system (OpenBSD) projects. He also co-founded the USENIX        Workshop On Offensive Technologies (WOOT).
