NEW YORK — A pair of NYPD cops gave $500 and a get-well card to two elderly twins who were robbed and assaulted on their way home.

According to the New York Post , the 71-year-old siblings were headed home April 5 after cashing a $1,100 social security check when a man wearing a surgical mask and a construction hat followed them into their apartment building and attacked them.

One of the women suffered a broken leg during the incident. The robber also stole the cash they were carrying.

Officer Anthony Loverme and Detective Kevin O’Donnell visited the twins in the hospital and surprised them with the money and card. Both officers worked the case, according to the report.

The suspect was later identified and arrested.

“Cops in New York City do things like this each and every day. I love the fact that my officers took it upon themselves and they rose to the occasion,” Inspector Brian Maguire said.
