
A father in the US has apologised for kicking his son off a skate ramp platform to teach him a lesson saying it was a "boneheaded" experiment in tough love.

A video of the incident was posted to Instagram on April 26, and shows Marcus Crossland kicking his six-year-old son onto a skateboard ramp in Arlington, Texas.

Thirteen-year-old Ryan Stephens filmed the appalling incident and told police that Mr Crossland remained unapologetic when confronted.

"He said he did it 'because he needs to learn’," Ryan said.

"I was like 'pushing him down is not teaching him how to drop in'. And then he said 'do you think you can raise him better than me?' and I said yes."

Now, speaking to the media for the first time following the incident, a contrite Mr Crossland told NBC he was only trying to help his son, Dino, "overcome his fear".

"It was an effort to help him, but it didn't come out that way … it was a bonehead decision.

"I'm sorry I used that tactic as opposed to another.

"I'm sorry for the outcome. Because of a decision I made, my wife and my children and everybody has got to deal with it," Mr Crossland said.

Since the incident was made public, Mr Crossland has been fired from his job and his family is being forced to move.

"It's been really tough," Mr Crossland's wife, Emily White said.

"You can be the most amazing, kind-hearted, giving person in the world. All it takes is that two seconds and people will hate you."

Ms White has rejected claims that her husband is abusive, calling him a "really great dad".

Mr Crossland said he's now planning to move the family out of the neighbourhood in an attempt to start over.
