
While the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) is focused on finalizing the Trans Pacific Partnership and making progress on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, it’s also touting what it calls a successful first two years of the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, which went into effect on May 15, 2012.

USTR says the agreement has supported job growth in the United States, increased exports for U.S. manufacturers, farmers and ranchers, and enhanced U.S. competitiveness in the global market. In 2013, U.S. exports to Colombia totaled $18.6 billion, up nearly 30 percent from 2011, the year before the agreement went into effect. Further, USTR says these exports supported approximately 80,000 U.S. jobs in 2013.

For agriculture, Colombia has become the third largest export market for U.S. agricultural products, with U.S. exports increasing more than 34 percent since 2011 to $1.51 billion. Exports of soybeans and soybean products, dairy, pork, grapes, tree nuts and rice have increased.

Beef exports have increased too, USTR says, to $9.1 million in 2013, a 133 percent increase from 2011. Implementing the trade agreement immediately eliminated the 80 percent tariff on prime and choice cuts of U.S. beef and is phasing out other tariffs over 15 years. The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association has stated previously that the agreement, for the first time ever, puts the United States on competitive footing with beef imports from Brazil and Argentina. It is expected that the agreement will result in $25-$30 million in additional U.S. beef exports to Colombia by year 10 of the agreement.

The momentum in 2013 has continued in 2014, according to USDA data compiled by the U.S. Meat Export Federation. From January-March 2013, the U.S. exported 322 metric tons of beef to Colombia valued at $1,153,000. During the first three months of 2014, U.S. beef exports to Colombia reached 1,056 metric tons, valued at $3,757,000. That’s a 228 percent and 226 percent increase in volume and value respectively. Additionally, in March alone, export volumes increased from 115 metric tons worth $338,000 in 2013 to 370 worth $1,435,000 metric tons in 2014.

Beyond increasing exports, the agreement has paved the way for the two countries to resolve other regulatory issues that have hindered trade in the past. For example, USTR highlights an effort to amend technical import certification requirements related to fresh and chilled pork that will further expand opportunities for U.S. exporters in the Colombian market.

Fascinating to see this assessment. However, I wonder what economic benefits have  accrued to Colombia? There is no mention of the benefits to Colombia in this short  report and only one mention of Colombian production in the original report itself!  How does one get a real sense of the MUTUAL benefits from such material? After all,  our experience with NAFTA reveals a rather more complex outcome than this reports  suggests. By the way, Colombia has a well-developed beef cattle industry that, agreed, cannot  supply the national market alone, but has some of the best animal science in the  tropics worldwide. No mention of how that is impacted, if at all.  I hate to say it, but this is another example of the navel-gazing perspective that  governs how we envision in this country.
