The five Chinese military officials indicted by the Justice Department on Monday for allegedly hacking U.S. firms may not wind up in a U.S. courtroom any time soon.

On Monday, the Justice Department handed out a stack of red and white "wanted" posters featuring photos of the men, who are believed to still be in China. Precedent suggests it is unlikely they'll be brought to Pennsylvania, where the indictments were handed down, to stand trial in the near future.

The U.S. doesn't have an extradition treaty with China. And alleged hackers in other countries without extradition treaties, such as Russia, have sat on the most-wanted list maintained by the cyber division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for years.

Announcing the charges Monday, Attorney General Eric Holder declined to give specifics about how the U.S. might apprehend the alleged Chinese hackers without Chinese cooperation.

"There are a range of things that we can do and we will employ all of them," he said.

So far, the U.S. has had the most success picking up alleged hackers and other fugitives living in countries where they're out of reach when they travel to countries that cooperate with the U.S. on arrest and extradition.

Last summer, Dominican Republic police detained a Russian man who had been charged in the U.S. with a sealed indictment for creating and selling a bank-robbing computer virus. Then they put him on a plane to Atlanta, where federal agents arrested him. In October, the Italians arrested a former UBS AG executive accused of aiding tax evasion who had been out of reach in Switzerland when he tried to check in at a hotel in Bologna and triggered an alert from Interpol. He was extradited and is scheduled to stand trial later this year.

Travel restrictions could act as a deterrent on other potential Chinese hackers, said Steven Chabinsky, the former top cyber lawyer at the FBI who now serves as the general counsel for CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm.

"It certainly sends a message to future generations about their choice of career because younger people who tend to have these skill sets are growing up in a very international environment and they long to see the world," he said. "There are not very many people who, by choice, want to self-limit their ability to travel around the world."
