
The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. has opened a new regional hub in the Dallas-Fort Worth area that “positions us closer to the bulk of our customer base and North American operations, as well as the important Gulf Coast and Midwest energy and downstream markets,” according to Chairman and CEO William A. Furman.

The hub, with nearly 6,000 square feet of office space in Colleyville, Tex., by June will have eight employees focused on product development, engineering, and retrofit design work for tank cars. Over the next year, Greenbrier will hire additional employees based at Colleyville in engineering or commercial roles, “adding to Greenbrier’s talent base located in Oregon, and elsewhere in North America and Europe,” said Furman.

“Our Colleyville staff has product development expertise and strength in engineering that adds to our talented team around the world. Together we will aggressively pursue retrofit opportunities for tank cars, design work for new railcars, and other opportunities presented by the dynamic rail transportation and energy markets we serve,” Furman concluded.

Greenbrier employs nearly 500 people across the Gulf Coast region including Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Florida. The Colleyville location increases Greenbrier’s full-time employment in the Dallas-Fort Worth area to more than 230 employees, including employees of Greenbrier Leasing Company in Fort Worth and Greenbrier Repair Services facility in Cleburne. Greenbrier’s total U.S. workforce exceeds 2,500 employees out of more than 9,000 employees worldwide.
