
When the annual defense authorization bill comes to the House floor this week, a controversial amnesty amendment won’t be up for debate.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., ruled out consideration of the ENLIST Act, a measure that would grant citizenship to illegal immigrants if they join the military. Rep. Jeff Denham, R-Calif., author of the amnesty measure, had planned to offer it as an amendment to the must-pass defense bill known as the National Defense Authorization Act.

“No proposed ENLIST amendments to NDAA will be made in order,” Doug Heye, Cantor’s deputy chief of staff, told Politico on Friday.

The president handed the Congress a disingenuous defense budget proposal and a Quadrennial Defense Review that most experts agree was just a rubber stamp for cutting military power. A good NDAA is essential for giving the Pentagon a roadmap for the tough tasks it faces in making missions and resources match. Distractions like the ENLIST Act divert focus from serious legislating.

Prior to Cantor’s decision, some high-ranking Republicans were lining up to fight Denham’s plan.

“Do I think we should put on the defense bill an amnesty provision for those [illegal immigrants] who serve in the military? The answer is no,” McKeon said.
