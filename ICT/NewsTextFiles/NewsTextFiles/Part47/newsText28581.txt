BIRMINGHAM, Alabama -- Alabama Parrot Rescue holds Parrots in the Park event at Avondale Park. The monthly event is a great place to see exotic birds up close. After problems with bad weather over the past several months, co-founders Art and Steff Davis have been able to hold two events.

It is a great opportunity to see parrots, macaws, amazons, cockatoos and other exotic birds up close. The event is held on the 3rd Sunday of every month from 12 noon until 2 p.m. at one of the pavilions at Avondale Park in Birmingham.

The Davis' have been rescuing parrots and other exotic birds for years. When owners can't care for the birds anymore, Art and Steff take them in, care for them and find them new homes.

The Parrots in the Park event is a way for Art and Steff to get the birds out into the community and help promote their cause.

The first event brought out a handful of parrot lovers. This month the number tripled. It was a cool damp day with rain threatening but people came out to see the birds.

Sunday featured several rescue birds along with parrot lovers who brought their pets. Blue and Gold Macaws, a Yellow Headed Amazon, an African Gray, a Blue Fronted Amazon and, what looked like a flock of Sulphur Crested Cockatoos.

Since last summer, The Davis' have taken in 17 birds, adopted out 5 and are fostering 4 at the rescue facility at their home. For more information about Alabama Parrot Rescue click on this link . There are many photos and a video of the facility.
