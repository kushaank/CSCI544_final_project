
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) â€” The University of Minnesota is again defending itself against the idea that it's overloaded with administrative costs.

The report says the schools spend too much on executives and administrative staff, at the expense of faculty and students. The authors say that from 2010 to 2012, the number of the University of Minnesota's non-academic administrators tripled to 2,384.

University President Eric Kaler says the report is "dead wrong." He says the institute used wrong data to reach faulty results.
