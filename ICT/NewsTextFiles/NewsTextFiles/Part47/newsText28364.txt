
But it appears standards Wisconsin State Patrol troopers must meet in order to qualify for promotions or pay hikes include requirements to write a minimum number of tickets and warnings per shift. That, says former state Representative DuWayne Johnsrud, is a quota, and quotas are what the bill he co-authored with State Senator Jon Erpenbach was intended to prevent.

But not only does the practice undermine the trust citizens must have in their law enforcement agencies, but it puts the officers themselves in the awkward position of having their motivation questioned during a stressful encounter with citizens.

We expect the State Patrol to change its policy and bring employee evaluation procedures back into compliance with state law.
