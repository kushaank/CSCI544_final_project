The new trailer for “Guardians of the Galaxy” arrived Monday during a Facebook Q&A with cast members Chris Pratt, Dave Bautista and Karen Gillan, as well as writer-director James Gunn — and it’s something to behold.

The cosmic adventure, due to open in theaters Aug. 1, follows roguish antihero Peter Quill (played by a pumped-up Pratt) on the run from a villain known as Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) after he comes into possession of a mysterious orb. Before long, Quill is allied with a rogues’ gallery that includes a gun-toting creature named Rocket Raccoon, voiced by Bradley Cooper; Zoe Saldana’s green alien assassin Gamora; Bautista’s vengeful Drax the Destroyer; and the tree-like humanoid Groot, voiced by Vin Diesel.

Check out the trailer below.

The wacky band of misfits is fleshed out more, including Diesel’s talking tree. Audiences finally get a taste of the flexing root’s iconic line, “I am Groot,” delivered in a gravelly voice. We also meet Cooper’s Rocket, who’s ready to do battle — with a weapon nearly as big as his body (not to mention his fearsome fangs). Meanwhile, Quill tries to summon his reputation as Star-Lord, the legendary outlaw, but it doesn’t get him too far. The trailer, the second to be released from Marvel, is a fine snapshot of the film’s wry humor ( view the first trailer here ).

In addition to the five guardians who make up the squad of misfits, the cast also features Michael Rooker as Yondu, Djimon Hounsou as Korath, Benicio del Toro as the Collector, Glenn Close as Nova Prime Rael and John C. Reilly as Rhomann Dey.

Marvel released a new poster for “Guardians of the Galaxy” on Friday.
