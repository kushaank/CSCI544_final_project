
Orlando Bloom appears to have found a new leading lady in his life in the form of British model Laura Paine.

The actor was rumoured to have been dating French actress Nora Arnezeder, but after being spotted arm-in-arm with Laura, believed to be 23-years-old, in west London this weekend, it would seem he is enjoying the honeymood period with a new love.

The apparent couple looked at ease with each other as they went on a double date for drinks and dinner at Little House in Mayfair.

Laura and Orlando kept it casual, with the actress opting for a short-sleeved blouse and green satin joggers, while the actor wore a printed T-shirt, jeans and trainers.

During one of their fag breaks, a homeless man approached Orlando who happily handed over a note to the gent in need.

Sadly that  wasn’t the only guy Bloom was confronted with, as another gent decided  to relieve himself right near the pub the actor was having a smoke  outside of.

Orlando  wasn’t often far away from Laura, and after dinner the two jumped into a  taxi to catch a late showing at Vue cinema in Westfield Shopping  Centre.

Bloom was  thought to have been dating actress Nora Arnezeder when they were  spotted on a date with back in January, at a bar in Los Angeles.

The  37-year-old actor split from model wife Miranda Kerr last autumn and has  since been linked to his Romeo & Juliet co-star Condola Rashad, Liv  Tyler, Selena Gomez and even Taylor Swift.

Laura hails from Oxfordshire, just like Orlando, and has taken part in modelling campaigns for the likes of H&M and even the Daily Mail's You magazine.
