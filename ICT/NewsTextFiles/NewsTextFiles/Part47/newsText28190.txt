PROVIDENCE, R.I. (WPRI) — A fungus called coffee rust has caused more than $1 billion in damage across Latin America, and is impacting consumers in the U.S.

Charles Fishbein from Coffee Exchange in Providence tells Eyewitness News that fungal problems are nothing new. However, this year’s problem is much larger than usual. Like many coffee shops across the country, Fishbein says he’s been forced to raise his prices because of the issue. But he says that’s not the biggest problem.

Farmers in Central America depend on the coffee crop to make a living. Fishbein is worried the ruined crops are making it extremely difficult for those farmers to care for their families. He’s putting together a fundraising effort to help a program that would replace the infected plant with new ones that can survive the fungus.

The U.S. Agency for International Development plans to announce a $5 million partnership with Texas A&M University to try to eliminate the fungus.
