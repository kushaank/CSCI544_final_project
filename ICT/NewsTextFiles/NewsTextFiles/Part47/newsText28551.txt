
The organization “Safe Campus” in Colorado is pushing for a November ballot initiative to BAN concealed carry on the state's college campuses.

What is your solution, Ken? Peeing on the attacker? Submitting to the rape and beating with the hope an attacker will let you live? Toltz’s phrase “handing out guns” shows just how ignorant he is about concealed carry.

For your info, Ken, there is no effort or initiative to “hand out guns” to women. People who have a concealed carry permit have had training, have a legal right to carry for the purpose of self defense, and have “purchased” their guns “legally” which is more than I can say about the criminals and thugs out there with guns.

Ken’s focus is wrong and his priorities are misplaced.

According to Boulder’s The Daily Camera , Toltz also said those who defend concealed carry as a way for women to fight sexual assault “politicize” and conflate two issues – sexual assault and concealed carry – which ought to be dealt with separately.

Toltz did not explain why his group is pushing a ban that will disarm law-abiding female gun owners who go through an extensive personal background check before being issued a concealed carry permit for self-defense.
