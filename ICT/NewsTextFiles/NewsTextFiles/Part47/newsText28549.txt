
A 22-year-old woman who failed to mention to her parents that she’d dropped out of Quinnipiac University did what many of us would do: she panicked. Then, she called in two bomb threats Sunday to try and cancel the university’s commencement ceremonies, the Associated Press reports .

Police soon managed to trace the calls back to Shea, who has been charged with first degree threatening and falsely reporting an incident. She is being held on $20,000 bond and is scheduled for a May 30 court appearance.

The university’s College of Arts and Sciences commencement ceremony was delayed for an hour and a half as a result of the bomb threats.

Further proof that honesty — not bomb threats — is the best policy.
