A 48-year-old man will appear in Mandurah Magistrates Court next month charged over an alleged incident outside a Falcon shopping centre toilet.

It will be alleged the Bunbury man was at the Miami Plaza Shopping Centre on April 19 where he indecently assaulted a young girl under the age of 13.

It is still unclear whether or not the girl was at the shopping alone or with family at the time of the incident.

The arrest comes one week after police issued a series of photographs in the hope of identifying a man they believed could help with the investigation.

The 48-year-old was arrested and released on bail.

He will now appear in Mandurah Magistrates Court on June 3 charged with one count of indecent dealing with a child under 13 years.
