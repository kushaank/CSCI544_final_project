
Governor Jerry Brown says if you want to know the cause of California's wildfires, just look to global warming. That's what he told a national TV audience.

Brown told ABC's "This Week" climate change is responsible for the hot, dry conditions that are fueling the flames.

Brown also says Republicans are in denial of the reality of climate change.
