Three men in Hawke's Bay who gave a Mexican tourist a ride have later robbed him at gunpoint.

The 30-year-old man hitched a ride with the group in their ute on SH2 at the Napier-Taupo road turn-off this afternoon, police said.

They drove north towards Wairoa, stopping for petrol at Tutira, before ordering the tourist out of the car at gunpoint at the top of Mohaka Hill, about 30km west of Wairoa, about 2.30pm.

One of the men pointed a pistol at him while they took all his possessions, including a cell phone and a camera, before driving off, police said.

A motorist found the tourist on the side of the highway about 10 minutes later and alerted police.

He was badly shaken, but unhurt.

Police are hunting the offenders, believed to be locals.
