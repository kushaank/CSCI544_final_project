
LITTLE ROCK — The recent auction of tax-delinquent properties in Jefferson County collected $110,036.74 for county and state government, Commissioner of State Lands John Thurston announced.

The Land Commissioner’s office conducted the auction of delinquent properties recently at the Arts & Science Center in Pine Bluff. The auction drew 45 bidders and sold 56 parcels of land.

The Land Commissioner’s office conducts one tax-delinquent land sale per county each year to dispose of land on which the taxes have been past due over two years.

“A small percentage of certified parcels make it to public auction because a majority of the properties certified to our office are redeemed, which means that the back taxes are paid by the original owner,” according to Commissioner John Thurston.

Registered bidders may purchase land at the auctions. Registration to bid at land sales is free. Upon sale of tax-delinquent property, the commissioner issues a limited warranty deed to the highest bidder.

Thurston’s office returns delinquent tax and interest collected, whether through redemption or sale, to the county taxing unit just as if the money had been originally collected there.

“In 2013, we returned over $21 million to school districts and county governments,” Thurston said. “Of that, Jefferson County received $653,956.13. This process ensures stable revenues for local public schools,” Thurston added.
