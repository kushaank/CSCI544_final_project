
Secretary of State John Kerry told graduates of Boston College to “set the world aflame,” during the commencement speech he delivered at the school’s graduation ceremony Monday, May 19.  Kerry is a graduate of Boston College Law School.

Kerry, who served the Commonwealth on Capitol Hill for 28 years as a U.S. senator, spoke of keeping faith in God, confronting climate change, and spreading the Jesuit value of “service to others” at the 138th commencement at BC’s Alumni Stadium.

He began his speech by saying that after serving in the Vietnam War and questioning his faith, he found a renewed sense of compassion when he entered BC’s law school.

Kerry then spoke about graduates cultivating the Jesuit spirit of service by caring about global social and environmental issues in places like the Middle East, Ukraine and South Sudan.

Kerry also had a few more lighthearted moments.

Kerry closed the commencement speech by asking students to fulfill the responsibility that comes with receiving a world-class education by spreading knowledge.
