
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - Officials in North Korea are offering a rare public apology after the collapse of an apartment building that was under construction in the country's capital.

The country's official news agency didn't give a death toll -- but a South Korean official says hundreds may have died.

The North Korean news agency said the accident was "serious" and that it upset North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un.

It says the collapse occurred Tuesday -- and that it happened because the construction "was not done properly" and was supervised in an "irresponsible manner."

A South Korean government official says the 23-story apartment building that collapsed was presumed to have housed 92 families. That could mean the casualties could be in the hundreds -- but it's not clear whether all of the residents were inside at the time of the collapse.

It's not unusual for people to start living in apartments in North Korea before the construction is complete.

The North Korean news report says the rescue operation ended yesterday, and officials apologized to bereaved families.

On the streets of the North Korean capital today, residents are expressing outrage. One resident told the Associated Press that the people in charge of the construction project "broke the rules and methods of construction."
