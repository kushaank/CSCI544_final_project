
FARMINGTON â€” A clinic on Wednesday will provide free legal services for San Juan County and Navajo Nation veterans.

DNA People's Legal Services Volunteer Lawyer Program and the San Juan College Veteran Center are hosting the event, which is from 1 to 4 p.m. in room 9006 of San Juan College's Henderson Fine Arts Center.

Lawyers licensed to practice in New Mexico and on the Navajo Nation will offer veterans free consultations on civil legal issues. Resources will also be available for veterans who need help on criminal issues.

Representatives from veterans agencies and programs, including the Farmington Vet Center, Veterans Justice Outreach, Presbyterian Medical Services and the New Mexico Department of Veterans' Services, will also provide assistance.

"This is the first clinic we're putting on, but we actually expect this to be a long-term, semi-regular event in Farmington," said Cathryn Abeyta, coordinator for the Volunteer Lawyer Program.

A $1,000 grant from the Young Lawyers Division of the State Bar of New Mexico will fund future clinics, Abeyta said. The group hosts its own veterans clinics in Albuquerque, and Abeyta said she knows local veterans who travel to the city for a 20-minute consultation with an attorney.

"I feel that's wrong. I feel we need to be providing those services to our veterans locally," Abeyta said.

Veterans can speak with attorneys who specialize in a number of areas, including family law, veterans benefits, consumer rights and landlord/tenant issues.

"It's sort of our beta test clinic," Abeyta said. "We're prepared for anything at this one."
