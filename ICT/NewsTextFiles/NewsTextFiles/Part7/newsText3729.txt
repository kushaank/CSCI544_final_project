U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell makes a brief campaign stop in Owensboro, stopping by the Owensboro-Daviess County Regional Airport. The Senate Minority Leader is facing opposition in Tuesday's primary election. McConnell made no mention of his primary opponent during the election eve visit with Western Kentucky supporters.

Republican challenger Matt Bevin, a Louisville businessman, was an early favorite of many Tea Party groups. But although he is well-funded, polls suggest Bevin's popularity has fizzled out.

The latest Bluegrass Poll found 55-percent of likely GOP voters support McConnell, while 35-percent prefer Bevin. Monday Bevin's campaign said undecided voters could put a Bevin victory within reach, but McConnell disagreed.

"I fully expect to be the nominee of my party and we'll then pull everyone together and head into the general election," said McConnell whose campaign has already made likely Democratic nominee Alison Lundergan Grimes the main target. "Kentucky has a chance not only to change America, but improve the situation for our state. No first term person voting for Harry Reid for majority leader and sitting in the back of the room will be able to deliver the clout and influence that I can. Not only for America, but for our state."

The five term incumbent's real test will likely come in a November showdown with Grimes. The Bluegrass Poll shows the two are neck-in-neck among voters. Grimes is facing token opposition in the primary election.
