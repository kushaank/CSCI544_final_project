
Sidecar racer Debbie Barron called in on pupils at St John’s School recently to give them an insight into the world of TT racing.

While she was there she told them she would be taking part in this year’s races and the children took the chance to sit in the sidecar – which she calls Oscar – and ask questions.

‘It was a lovely day and very rewarding,’ she said.

‘We wanted to inspire them to have a go at something and follow their dreams. We told them we are never going to be number one in our sport but we give it a go and we enjoy it. The message to them was to keep going and enjoy something even if they are not the best at it.

Her Southern 100 passenger from last year, Stephen Cowin, went with her to the school and explained the finer techniques of being a passenger in a racing outfit.

Debbie was refused time off from work to compete in this year’s TT and has left her job at the Southern Area Swimming Pool in order to take part. She is now working as secretary of the Friends of the Hyperbaric Chamber in Douglas.
