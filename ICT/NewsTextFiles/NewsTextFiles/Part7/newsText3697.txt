
The Canadian Electricity Association is urging the federal government to establish tighter regulations surrounding metal transactions as the theft of copper continues.

In the past six years, eight people have died in relation to copper theft, Smith said.

Gatineau Police created a special unit focused on copper theft to curb the ongoing problem, said Sgt. Jean-Paul Lemay.

"We've had regular arrests but the thefts keep going on," Lemay said.

"It really is only as effective as it is in the province next door. For example, if in Nova Scotia there is a tightening of that transaction, New Brunswick may see an uptick in incidents there."

For the most part, those caught stealing copper are charged with theft under $5,000.

"Maybe it's time to update the Criminal Code for an offence that could be used in this case, that would be more proportional to the impact of these crimes," Smith said.
