Suthers was the keynote speaker.  He called his address "On Your Way to becoming a Good Ancestor."

He also spoke to students about the importance of each person's contribution to make our communities a better place.

"The solutions to our communities' problems begins with each one of us doing everything we can in our own life, in our own jobs, in our own schools, in our own churches, and, most importantly, in our own families to make responsible choices."
