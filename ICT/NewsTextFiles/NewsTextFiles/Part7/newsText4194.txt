
A Northwood High School senior's revealing graduation ceremony prank may have gotten some laughs and gone viral, but it also landed him in court and without a diploma in hand.

Ronnie Younce says it was his last chance for a senior prank. "Just something funny to do," he said, explaining that he had been planning it for a week or two. He says he did it because everybody always talks about doing pranks, but no one ever does it.

On Thursday night, he went for it. "They warn if you do a prank, you're not gonna walk on stage," Younce explains. "I just waited until I was on stage."

When his name was called, he strolled up to center stage at the Shreveport Convention Center and opened his orange gown, revealing a pair of speedos and nothing else underneath.

He was quickly escorted off the stage as some in the crowd cheered and hooted. He says he was taken directly to the Caddo Sheriff's Office. While he wasn't booked that night, he says was given a summons for disturbing the peace.

Caddo schools spokesman Victor Mainiero says Younce was also cited for interfering with the operation of a school.

According to Mainiero, Younce will receive his diploma from the Caddo Parish school system once the superintendent has a conference with the student and his parents. A date for that conference had not been set as of Friday afternoon.

"I knew I'd probably get handcuffed," Younce says, but he claims he didn't know it would go this far. "I didn't show anything that wouldn't show on TV."

Younce tells KSLA News 12 that he is leaving leave June 20 for a welding college in Tulsa, OK.
