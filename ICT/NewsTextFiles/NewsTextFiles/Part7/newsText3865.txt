
Travel experts say more than 36 million Americans will travel more than 50 miles this Memorial Day weekend.

A strong case of cabin fever and a little more money to spend should inspire a greater number of Americans to hit the road.

A little more than 700,000 of those travelers are from Wisconsin, according to AAA. That's a 1.1 percent increase from last year.

The holiday travel volume across the country is expected to reach a post-recession high, with eight of ten travelers driving to their destination, according to AAA.

Another shred of good news for travelers – gas prices are expected to continue on a downward trend. Gas experts say supply is rising and say the average driver will pay $3.63 per gallon.

“The temporary stability in the national average will ebb over the next week or two, and gas prices will head down again as we approach Memorial Day," GasBuddy.com Senior Petroleum Analyst Patrick DeHaan said.
