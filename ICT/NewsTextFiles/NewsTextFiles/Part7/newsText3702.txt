Already more than 3,000 people have been evacuated after the first ship set sail on Sunday, while 16 critically injured Chinese nationals left Vietnam on a chartered flight. Two Chinese workers were killed and dozens more injured in unrest over a Chinese oil rig in disputed waters. VoR’s Brendan Cole spoke Sachin Gavaskar, a journalist from Ho Chi Min City, in Southern Vietnam.

Gavaskar told VoR that “in the key locations in Ho Chi Min City, there were hundreds of policemen and police vehicles”.

“There were only a few small sporadic groups who gathered in key areas but they were dispersed very quickly. Since yesterday’s late morning there have been no protests here at all. But the police presence, especially in the industrial areas, is still quite strong.

This will definitely affect Vietnam’s economy, says Gavaskar.

It would have looked bad for the Vietnamese government if they didn’t allow these showcases of patriotism, for its citizens to come out and protest against China, explains Gavaskar.

“They are blaming the violence on criminal gangs. In fact they have arrested a couple of criminal gang leaders. Some of their photos have been published in the local state-owned media.
