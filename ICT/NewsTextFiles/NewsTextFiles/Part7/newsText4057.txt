
Mammoet employed the LR13000, reported to be the biggest crawler crane in the world, to install four platform legs on Van Oord’s newest wind turbine installation vessel, Aeolus.

In 12 days the giant crane was assembled at Lloyd Werft in Bremerhaven, Germany. The first of the four 87m long steel platform legs, each weighing 920 tons, were settled into its jacking position on the 139 x 38 m vessel. For the job, Mammoet designed, fabricated and delivered tailor-made top lifting tools and a tailing frame to ensure that the legs, that have no lifting points, can be lifted securely. In addition to the platform legs, Mammoet will also install four spudcans, using a specially engineered method.  This method involves placing the partly rigged spudcans on the seabed, moving the Aeolus over it and connecting the spudcan with the leg with the use of cranes and divers.
