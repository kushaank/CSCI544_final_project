
A Federal Communications Commission proposal to trim Internet and telephone subsidies to schools and libraries is raising red flags in cash-strapped school districts.

The subsidies, known as E-rates, underwrote more than $1.1 billion in costs for telephone service, new websites, Internet connections and email access for 1,100 Pennsylvania schools and libraries between 1998 and 2012, according to the Pennsylvania Association of School Business Officers.

Although the FCC has not released its final plan, many suspect the agency intends to phase out subsidies for legacy services such as telephone voice services and hosted email, and add money for technologies and services.

U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Scranton, fears changes could hurt many schools.

With about 1,300 students enrolled in the Apollo-Ridge School District, the district relies on about $25,500 in E-rates to support web-hosting and telephone services, according to Superintendent Matt Curci.

Curci said he worries about how another funding cut, if one occurs, would affect his district.

Ryan Manzer, the business manager for Freeport Area School District, said he hopes that if the FCC does make changes to E-rates, it doesn't cut money, just reapportion it.

âWe get a significant discount on our voice, Internet and cellphone plans,â Manzer said about his district of about 2,000 students. âWhat is proposed would likely cause us to get reduced funding for cellphones and voice lines.

âWe're hoping there will be an offsetting swing from data services and hardware related funds, to Internet and newer technologies.

Julie Tritt Schell, E-rate coordinator for the Pennsylvania Department of Education, said the changes could have an upside.

âPennsylvania's schools and libraries will certainly be impacted by the elimination of voice E-rate funding, but we stand to benefit substantially by providing more schools and libraries with access to E-rate funding for internal connections, such as Wi-Fi equipment and internal wiring,â she said.

The New Kensington-Arnold School District, with about 2,050 students, received E-rate subsidies of about $127,000 last year to help offset about $170,000 in costs for phone service, Internet connections, fiber optic and its grading website, Superintendent John Pallone said.

In Pittsburgh Public Schools, which serve about 24,500 students, officials are shifting voice service where possible to broadband, and, in the process, reduced phone costs from $1.7 million in 2010 to about $1 million this year. Pittsburgh hopes to reduce that to $500,000 a year within three years, said Scott Gutowski, director of end-user services for the district.

The savings would lessen the blow of shifting subsidies but would leave the school district with a $400,000 gap to fill if voice subsidies are ultimately capped at 20 percent, Gutowski said.

âIf E-rate voice goes away, I'm not happy,â Gutowski said.
