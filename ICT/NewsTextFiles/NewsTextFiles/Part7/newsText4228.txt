
FORTVILLE - The sixth annual Mt. Vernon Relay for Life raised more than $30,000 for anti-cancer efforts during the weekend.

The event was bolstered by a record turnout, with 19 teams making laps for 24 hours with a total of more than 250 participants at the Mt. Vernon Middle School track. Organizers honored cancer survivors and caregivers with a special lap around the track, and the nightâ€™s Luminaria Ceremony offered a more somber approach to remembering and honoring loved ones after a day full of activities and superhero-inspired events.
