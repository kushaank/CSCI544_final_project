
The teachers belonging to the Association of Calicut University Teachers (ACT) and the Calicut University Teachers Association (CUTA) described the suspension as impudent and irresponsible. Dr. Thasneem, during an adalat conducted by the Vice-Chancellor on Saturday, had questioned his actions, and criticised him for delaying the probation of several teachers.

Dr. Salam, offended by the criticism, immediately suspended Dr. Thasneem for indiscipline, and ordered an inquiry by Pro Vice-Chancellor K. Ravindranath.

ACT secretary P. Sivadasan, in a statement here on Sunday, said the university action could not be justified at any level. He said it was the latest in a series of ‘anti-teacher’ and ‘anti-academic’ actions taken by the Vice-Chancellor since he took charge.

Dr. Sivadasan accused the Vice-Chancellor of behaving like a tyrant. Demanding the intervention of Chancellor Sheila Dikshit, the ACT said the suspension of Dr. Thasneem should be revoked immediately.

CUTA president P. Raveendran said the academic atmosphere on the university campus was being vitiated by the autocratic actions of the Vice-Chancellor.

He demanded that academic freedom and peace should be brought back to the campus.
