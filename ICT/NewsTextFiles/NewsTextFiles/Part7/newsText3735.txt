
BAYOMBONG, Nueva Vizcaya , Philippines   – Some 9.6 million registered voters won’t be allowed to participate in the 2016 elections if they fail to update their voters’ records using the biometrics system.

Commission on Elections (Comelec) Chairman Sixto Brillantes said registration by old registered voters through the biometrics system is compulsory in the synchronized national and local elections in 2016.

“Voters who don’t have biometrics are automatically disqualified to vote,” Brillantes said.

Brillantes went to Ilocos Norte recently for the voters’ registration launch.

The poll body said 18 percent or 9.6 million voters of the 53 million registered voters in the country lack biometrics.

Brillantes called on all registered voters to validate their registration at their respective local Comelec offices within the 17-month period of continuing registration, including Saturdays and Sundays.

He warned the registration period will not be extended and failure of the old registered voters to update their records through biometrics system will mean they will not be allowed to vote in the 2016 polls.

“Nevermind the new qualified registrants as they will automatically undergo the biometrics process once they register,” Brillantes said.
