MITCHELL COUNTY, Iowa – The Mitchell County Sheriff’s Office is confirming a Riceville student was killed in a car crash earlier on Monday. Junior, Ryan Gaffey was the victim in the crash. Sheriff Greg Beaver says it happened on 430th Street near McIntire. The teen collided with a semi truck. The Sheriff says Gaffey may not have stopped at a stop sign and pulled in front of the semi. The teen was taken to Mitchell County Regional Health Care Center, where he died. The accident is under investigation.

Meanwhile, Riceville Schools Superintendent Dr. Steve Nicholson says they were informed by Gaffey’s step-brother of his passing. Dr. Nicholson told the staff and then called grade 9-12 students into the gym to share the news. He says the school counselor has arranged for support staff to be at the school and available to speak with students as long as they are needed.
