
Marco Rubio recently gave two interviews in which he once again dismissed the theory of global warming (or as the Right has us all referring to as "Climate Change").

 What this means long term for the American people will be absolutely devastating. Three million Americans live within three feet of sea level. As the oceans rise much of the coast of this country will be underwater. Nearly the entire state of Florida will disappear and watch out New York City. It may be too late already to change the course of this disaster, our inability to agree on the fact that this climate change is a real problem has already put us behind the eight ball. But one thing is for sure according to the world's scientists, to do nothing will most certainly accelerate the problem.

 We were warned of this problem years ago by former Vice President Al Gore with his film "An Inconvenient Truth." We were warned by the world's scientific community that Global Warming was a very real impending disaster. We did nothing to heed their warnings then and if we do nothing now we will most certainly reap the tragic results of our foolishness.
