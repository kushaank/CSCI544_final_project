
Santo Domingo.- Dominican Republic is headed in the right direction, according to 58.3 percent of its citizens, while 39.9% say no way.

The results are from a survey of more than 1,200 Dominicansby pollster Asisa Research Group conducted from May 9 to 11 and published by El Caribe, in which 1.8% declined comment.

The survey sought to establish the population’s beliefs regarding the country’s advances, and its expectation on the future.

The poll, with 1,213 interviews and a margin of error of +/-2.83%, also found marked differences between youngsters and adults as to how they perceive the country’s direction, as well among men and women.

Just goes to show how keeping the populace ignorant allow those in control to stay in power.

Considering that most people only read to keep up with baseball, you can't really expect anyone to know what's going on.

juanb, you're thinking about the wrong country, that's in the US where they only read the sports section. Here we only care about reading stories about crimes, killings and accidents.

If USA is your ideal model forget it. In the US the news is whatever is full of lie and distortion. Being unable to read, not reading out of your own accord or reading distorted biased news is equally bad.

In the US people don't read the news, they read convenient preconceived lies.

"marked differences". Well, I would have like to know what they are. There's much to be garnered/collected/extracted from knowing what those differences are.!

Older people have the experience to compare the old governments versus the new. But not necessarily  the struggles to get ahead, as younger folks do. This because they are still trying to trod a path fully dependent on the economy.

I think most women have an even better understanding of the current situation. They, for the most part, are tasked with the family's budget and how best to manage it. Our nation's political, economic, and even social reality are better understood by those that must face the daily challenge of figuring how to pay bills, while still having enough to feed the clan.

And yes, I think we're better off in this current government....This, because Medina has chosen to cut a different path than previous ones. The others were content to follow one of least resistance. One where the president set government in auto-pilot, and sat back to enjoy the money plundered and prestige of being there.

I won't say medina is the ultimate in governance. There will, more than likely, be others who could do a much better job. But for now, we must thank heaven we've got one who's forging new ways of serving the people.

As one of my cousins remarked: "Medina has set precedents by which all future presidents will be judged.".. I think this is the new reality. If Leo is elected again, no way we'll stand for his old corrupt ways.

Whoever assumes the presidency, will have adhere to more stringent criterions than anyone before him/her.

We have tasted the ways of a different political soup, and we like it. As things stand now, nothing else will do.

Read between the lines, kid.

You  keep talking crap about the US yet don't want to part with that imaginary US citizenship of yours.

Poor kid.
