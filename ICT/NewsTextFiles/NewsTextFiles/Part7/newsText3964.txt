
LONDON: A Â£10m prize would decide the  greatest scientific problems facing the world today.

Britain's Technology Strategy Board along with Nesta on Monday announced the Longitude Prize 2014 and six potential challenges have been announced: how can we fly without damaging the environment; how can we ensure everyone has nutritious, sustainable food; how can we prevent the rise of resistance to antibiotics; how can we restore movement to those with paralysis; how can we ensure everyone can have access to safe and clean water and how can we help people with dementia to live independently for longer.

The prize marks the 300th anniversary of the Longitude Act where in 1714 the British government set out the scientific challenge of how to pinpoint a ship's location at sea. This was solved by watchmaker John Harrison who designed the chronometer, the first seafaring clock that allowed accurate navigation. The solution not only led to safer sea travel but opened up global trade.

Minister for Universities and Science, David Willetts, said: "This prize will challenge scientists to tackle one of today's greatest scientific problems. What makes this prize so innovative however, is that the public will be given the power to decide which area of science and society will benefit from this funding. This is everyone's opportunity to play a part in what could be the next scientific milestone".
