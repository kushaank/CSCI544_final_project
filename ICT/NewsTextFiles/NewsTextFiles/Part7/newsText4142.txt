
With the passage of Proposition KIDS in April 2014, the second phase of the Long Range Plan is nearing completion. Members of the next Long Range Planning Team will examine growth projections, current facilities and discuss goals and tasks for the R-III District for five years past the completion of a second middle school. A second middle school will open in August 2016.

The Long Range Planning Team will meet approximately six times during the 2014-15 school year with a goal of recommending a plan to the Board of Education by the end of the school year. District officials anticipate the team will meet monthly until a plan is developed. After the Board of Education approves a plan, the team meets annually to revisit it, analyze growth projections and identify any necessary amendments.
