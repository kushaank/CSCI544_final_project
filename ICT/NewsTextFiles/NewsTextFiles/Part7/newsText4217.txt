I have just finished my Std X (CBSE) exams and am waiting for my results. The problem is I have no idea if I should continue with CBSE in Std XI or switch to the State Board. Some have asked me to change boards as itâ€™s easier to score high marks in the State Board. I am extremely confused. Please suggest a good idea before the results are announced.

This is a decision you should be taking based on feedback from your teachers, your parents and your gut. Your teachers will have the best idea of what your academic abilities are, so talk to them and see if they think your strengths are geared more towards studying in the CBSE style of education or towards State Board.

You also need to consider how you will juggle preparing for competitive entrance exams alongside your schoolwork. Talk to people who have realised your goals (i.e. gone to your dream college, studying your dream course, getting your dream job) and understand how they managed.

Getting admission in a new school is not an easy process, so if you are thinking about it, you should consult your parents and understand what options are available.

Finally, your gut will help you make the final decision. Are you happy in your current academic environment? Do you have a good support system of friends and teachers at your existing school? Are you confident that you will be able to reach your goals regardless of the board? Take all this into account before making a decision.
