
May 20, 2014: An ex-security guard has allegedly been killed by his former workmate during a botched robbery in the Gold Coast.

A security guard who shot dead his former workmate after being ambushed in a botched pub robbery was left shaken and distraught by the ordeal.

The former security guard and 46-year-old father of five attempted to rob the Highland Park Tavern on the Gold Coast last night just before 8pm.

He armed himself with a replica handgun and donned a motorcycle helmet and hi-vis vest. When his former colleague, with whom he'd worked at security company Border Security, was delivering the day's takings, he ambushed him.

A scuffle broke out and the security guard on duty fired approximately three shots, according to witnesses.

The assailant was killed, and the security guard left shaken and covered in blood. But it got worse.

It wasn't until police removed the man's helmet that the 47-year-old guard realised he'd shot his former colleague.

It is believed the robber had been laid off by the security firm and was struggling to make ends meet. He used his inside knowledge of Border Security's procedures to plan what he thought was the perfect crime.

The guard is undergoing counselling after the incident, after spending a day being interviewed by police. He has not been charged.

Detective Superintendent David Hutchinson of Gold Coast Police told The Courier-Mail that the guard had a "difficult day".

"He would have been acting instinctively and it was over very quickly," he said.

"It’s a horrible thing that’s happened," he said.

A report is being prepared for the coroner.
