Mothers left homeless with their young children have come together to highlight the housing crisis affecting families.

The group launched their Facebook page “ Housing Action ” in Dublin yesterday, which aims to bring together families hit by the housing crisis and force the Government to build suitable accommodation.

Mother-of-two Philomena Deans (25), from Airfield, said she had lived in privately rented accommodation but could not afford to pay the rent hike of €250 a month.

Ms Deans said she travelled more than an hour each way to bring her son (9) and daughter (4) to school each day, catching two buses and walking more than an hour. “I’m trying my best to keep some sense of normality,” she said.

Ms Deans said she was first on a waiting list for a house nine years ago.

Tamara Kearns (25), said her family became homeless when her husband’s hours were cut at work and they were evicted when they could not pay their arrears in rent.

The couple and their two young children were forced to stay in emergency accommodation and have lived in a unit for homeless people in Crumlin since last October.

“Families are being forced to stay in prison-like circumstances. People are really struggling to survive,” she said. “We’ve broken the taboo around being homeless by speaking out and introduced a new type of people homelessness – it’s families.
