
ASTON � Commissioners President Jim Stigale will be making a major announcement regarding the proposed expansion of the Delaware County Technical School on Crozerville Road at Wednesday�s commissioners meeting.

The board will meet at 7 p.m. in the commissioners meeting room at the municipal building on Pennell Road.

The Delaware County Intermediate Unit hopes to move students from leased spaces at the Delaware County Academy at the Collingdale Community School and the County Alternative School in Middletown to the Aston site. The current school population would increase from 400 to 800 students and include the Head Start program, Career Technical School and Alternative School.

The proposal includes increasing the footprint of the technical school from 70,000 square feet to 160,000 square feet and an additional parking area on the west side of the site.

Intermediate unit representatives said they hope to have a multi-use facility at the Aston facility to better serve the entire county, which would also be cost effective.

To date, two public meetings have been held, and at both, residents were extremely vocal about their opposition to the plan. From safety, traffic and environmental concerns, to infrastructure deterioration, and the possible decrease in home values, residents have been firm and unified in their resistance.

Residents have claimed they were not properly informed of the proposal and have accused the DCIU of �trying to pull one over� on them. Intermediate unit officials have disputed these claims, stating that their board meetings have been open to the public.

Intermediate unit Executive Director Lawrence O�Shea and other representatives have continuously attempted to quell the fears of the residents and reiterate the positives of having the expansion completed.

Stigale said the board of commissioners, to date, have not been presented with plans for the expansion from the intermediate unit.
