
After the devastating Cocos Fire, many residents are returning home only to find they no longer have a home. NBC 7's Artie Ojeda was there as they sifted through the ashes.

Â The fires have died out and the smoke has cleared. Now many residents are returning home -- only to find they no longer have a home.

"I'm in shock," said Robert Yamashiro, who returned to his Harmony Grove home. "I understand it took two minutes for all of this to happen. I've been finding melted metals and glass. You can see the intensity of the heat."

Yamashiro's mother lived in the home built by the family in 1983. It's in a remote area off the southern most edge of Country Club Drive.

There are at least four burned-out shells of cars there. At least four homes have been lost.

Alden Hough lives in the same area and lost his childhood home. His mother still lived there.

"There's a lot of memories there that's for sure," said Hough.

He said the property is home base for the nonprofit Sky Mountain Institute, which teaches people how to live a sustainable life off the earth.

"This is a terrible thing, I've put a lot of work here, but we're gonna make this place better and we're going to teach people how to live more sustainably with nature," said Hough.
