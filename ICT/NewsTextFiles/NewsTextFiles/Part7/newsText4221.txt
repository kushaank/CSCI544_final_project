
The Minot Public School District is moving forward with its remodel projects.

The school board met Monday afternoon to discuss future plans at Edison and Perkett Elementary Schools. The board approved JLG Architects to do design work while Kraus-Anderson will serve as the project manager.

And, they're not wasting any time to get started. Teams will be meeting with teachers this week to discuss needs within the schools, so they can develop a design that works within the district's budget.

"Like any building project, it has to be a cohesive plan with everyone working together in the right direction to make sure that we come up with a positive plan, which is good for the city, good for our students and good for the district. But, we have to work in collaboration on this and we're moving forward from that point on,‚Äù says Minot Public Schools Superintendent Mark Vollmer.

Bidding for the ground work is expected in late July or early August. The project is expected to be completed by the fall of 2015.
