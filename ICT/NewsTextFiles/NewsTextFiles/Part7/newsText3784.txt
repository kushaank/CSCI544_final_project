OAKLAND — A coalition of environmental and community groups will host a meeting Tuesday evening at the public library to educate residents on a proposed oil pipeline.

The Pilgrim Pipeline would link Albany, N.Y. and Linden, N.J. It would carry crude oil originating from the Bakken region of North Dakota.

The pipeline would carry crude down to the Phillips 66 Bayway refinery in Linden and refined products up to Albany.

Organizers of the Tuesday meeting, which include the NJ Sierra Club, Food and Water Watch and the NJ Highlands Coalition, said the Bakken oil is highly explosive and could lead to spills and accidents in communities along the pipeline.

"The Pilgrim Pipeline project would bring an extreme, dangerous fuel source into both densely populated and environmentally sensitive areas along its route," Kate Millsaps, conservation program director for the NJ Sierra Club, said. "This infrastructure would create a serious risk and communities along the route need to know what the impacts will be and what rights they have."

Pilgrim Pipeline Holdings hasn't filed documents or permit applications with government agencies, but has begun surveying land and speaking with officials about building a pipeline.

The meeting is scheduled for Tuesday at 6:30 p.m. at the Oakland Public Library, 2 Municipal Plaza. Future meetings are planned in Parsippany and Fanwood.
