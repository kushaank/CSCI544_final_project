
The Danish Business Authority said it is starting a new consultation over subsidies for the provision of broadband services on the island of Bornholm, after it made two key changes to the model. One concerns the allocation of points per address served and the other concerns the list of addresses. The deadline for comments is 02 June.

To help choose from among bidders, points will now be given for the speed at each address, and weighting will be given for providing high speeds early in the period 2016-2020. The other change concerns the inclusion of summer cabins in the supply list. Some 10,500 first homes, businesses and summer cabins are included in the list, and the authority welcomes information about addresses that ought to be added to or removed from the list.
