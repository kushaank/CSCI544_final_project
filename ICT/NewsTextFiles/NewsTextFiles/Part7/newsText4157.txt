
The conception of this new Institute will initiate a new venture, whereas aspiring students will have the opportunity to enroll into new courses targeted at training the attendees in the niche industries which are going through exponential growth throughout the global scene. This will enrich the Maltese Educational Sector and open new academic and occupational opportunities, which to this day were virtually inexistent in Malta.

The collaboration will provide students at MCAST with access to AAT Research’s labs and hands-on experience of applied technologies in the commercial sector. Under the agreement, AAT Research will also be offering internships to students following engineering, software-related, business and administration courses.

AAT Research develops affordable technologies to improve people's quality of life. Its first product, the award-winning, patented Mente™, is a neurofeedback device for home use in the management of autism in children. Since early 2014, Mente™ is being marketed internationally. AAT Research also conducts neuroscience research projects for international clients.

The signing of the agreement at the MCAST campus in Paola was attended by  Evarist Bartolo, Minister for Education and Employment.
