Santa Clara County D.A. in Sierra LaMar murder case: 'This defendant should face the ultimate penalty'

The Santa Clara County district attorney announced Monday that he will seek the death penalty against a man accused of kidnapping and murdering 15-year-old Sierra LaMar, a Morgan Hill teenager who disappeared on her way to school more than two years ago.

Her body has not been found.

Sierra, a vibrant cheerleader, left for school on the morning of March 16, 2012, but never arrived. A day later, deputies found her cellphone less than a mile from her home; the following day, they located her black and pink Juicy Couture purse — with her underwear and San Jose Sharks jersey folded neatly inside.

Physical evidence linked Garcia-Torres and his vehicle to the case and he was arrested in May 2012.

In a brief statement Monday morning, Dist. Atty. Jeff Rosen said he had communicated his decision to the court, defense counsel and Sierra's family.

Rosen said he would not be commenting further in order “to ensure that the defendant receives a fair trial."

On the advice of his attorney, Garcia-Torres had declined to enter a plea to charges for more than a year. As a result, Rosen took the case to the grand jury. That indictment, handed down in February, ensured that the matter could proceed directly to trial without a preliminary hearing.
