
The Glen Ellyn Food Pantry is grateful to be part of a community that is so supportive of our mission to meet the ongoing needs of low income families and the immediate needs of families in crisis. The number of families we serve each month continues to increase dramatically. Even more astounding is that the demand for emergency food assistance has risen by 80% over the previous year! Currently, we serve over 400 families per month (1,700 individuals) and approximately 5,000 families per year, all from Glen Ellyn and surrounding communities, which includes Wheaton, Glendale Heights, Carol Stream, Lombard, and Lisle. Our clients are those who have lost their jobs or experienced major illness, or those who for other reasons have suffered financial setbacks and are experiencing food insecurities within their families.

As we move into the summer months, we have a growing need for support for our clients. Food and monetary donations are at their lowest during this time of year, as local schools and service organizations that regularly conduct food drives are not in session. Cash donations allow us to make-up for the shortfall in food donations and to purchase items that are not consistently donated, such as lunch meats and yogurt for children, milk, and personal care items.
