
BATON ROUGE, La. (KNOE 8 News) - Science is the theme of the State Library of Louisiana’s 2014 Summer Reading Program. It offers a variety of activities to draw families into libraries such as art projects, creative writing, interacting with performing artists and gaming. The children’s program is Fizz, Boom, Read; the teen program is Spark a Reaction and the adult program is Literary Elements.

These activities encourage students to continue to read throughout the summer while cultivating a love for reading in Louisiana’s next generation. Families are encouraged to check with their local public library to learn about specific incentives and programs available in their communities.

In 2013, 94,000 people participated in the Summer Reading Program and Louisiana libraries offered 8,500 free programs with more than 284,000 patrons in attendance. Studies show that youths who read during the summer return to school in the fall at or above their spring reading levels.

The Summer Reading Program is part of the Collaborative Summer Library Programs, a national cooperative to encourage reading throughout the summer. Those registered with the State Library’s Talking Books and Braille Library may also participate.
