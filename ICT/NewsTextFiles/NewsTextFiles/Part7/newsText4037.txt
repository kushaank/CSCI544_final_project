
(ANSAmed) - NICOSIA, MAY 19 - Talks between the Troika of international lenders (European Central Bank-European Commission-International Monetary Fund) and the Cyprus government on the financial sector have concluded while discussions continue on fiscal and structural reforms related issues, with the mission of technocrats leaving the island on Saturday.

The Troika inspectors, as daily Financial Mirror online reported, had two rounds of talks with government and public sector officials, as well as politicians and stakeholders, and their discussions have ranged from the delay in implementation of a national health service to the privatization of government owned services and assets.

In order to release the next tranche of the 10 billion euros bailout money, the Troika wants to see substantial progress in three key areas: regulations on the Fiscal Council should be adopted; a bill on the composition of the Resolution Authority must be approved; and, a report on what actions have been implemented in the past six months in relation to money laundering should be submitted to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (Oecd) by the end of May.(ANSAmed).
