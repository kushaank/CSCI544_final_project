
Residents have the option to bring their trash to the facility and pay a fee to have it hauled to the landfill. Instead, drivers have been waiting hours in line only to be turned away. Some even drove two and a half hours to get to the facility.

For months, that frustration has led to area residents illegally dumping trash on the side of the road.

“There's all kinds of stuff. They need to shut this place down and make them pay because this looks sick,” said resident Josie Bustillos.

When drivers make it to the facility’s gate, they are met with a sign saying there's been an unexpected breakdown. The facility usually features three trucks and three trailers but is currently down to one truck and two trailers.

The county department in charge of the facility said there isn’t much that can be done to improve the situation. The public works director said calls from residents are pouring in.

The truck and trailer repairs will cost tens of thousands of dollars, but there’s not a dime left in the public works maintenance budget to foot the bill.

The problems will persist until the equipment can get fixed or replaced, according to the public works director.

The county hopes to dump the facility and have a company manage it instead.

It worked out an agreement with Waste Management of New Mexico in 2013 to take over Conejo, but that contract is stuck in litigation because another trash company is contesting it.
