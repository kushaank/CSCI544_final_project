
NAVI MUMBAI: The deputy commissioner of police (zone-1) Suresh Mengade has enhanced nakabandi in his anti-chain snatching drive.

Cops have been deployed at all key junctions that are common exit routes for bike-borne chain snatchers. "We have deployed additional staff at nakabandis to rein in chain-snatchers. The additional security will help us catch these thieves," Mengade said.

Each nakabandi will have a vehicle with a wireless communication device, sub inspector and eight constables. Mengade has also been holding public awareness forums where he asked citizens to install CCTV cameras in their societies to prevent break-ins.
