
President John Mahama has called for greater collaboration between industry and academia to enable graduates fit into the job market.

The President was speaking at the opening ceremony of a two-day national conference on bridging gap between education, training and industry.

This is to strengthen links between education and industry in the country.

Addressing the conference, President Mahama said his administration is ready to provide all necessary interventions to achieve this objective.

He implored them to make suggestions to improve internships and apprenticeship for skills training,  practical attachments and incentives which could encourage industry to recruit and train graduates.

Youth unemployment which is high in Ghana is considered a hindrance to the country’s development.

Thousands of graduates of tertiary institutions  are unable to find jobs after undertaking their national service.

In 2012, a group of unemployed graduates came together and formed the Unemployed Graduates association to demand jobs from the government.

Some industry players and organizations say though there may not be jobs for the high numbers of graduates who leave school every year, many are unable to meet the requirements for the few existing jobs.

Many blame the education system and the irrelevant courses being studied in schools.
