
Sixteen Maine high school students are participating in the 25th annual Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Science mentoring program.

The  students began the program at the East Boothbay laboratory on Sunday.  They will work with scientist mentors, collect samples, conduct lab  experiments, analyze data and present scientific findings. The  laboratory has allowed 400 high school juniors from around the state to  participate in the program.

The program began in 1989 when two  young scientists and a Bigelow trustee conceived the idea. It is called  Keller BLOOM, meaning Bigelow Laboratory Orders of Magnitude Program, in  honor of Maureen Keller – a founding scientist who died in 1999.

The students will present their findings to parents and officials at the lab on Thursday.

The  Eddington and Denmark fire departments will receive more than $57,000  in Federal Emergency Management Agency operations and safety grants.

U.S.  Rep. Mike Michaud said FEMA is providing more than $34,000 to the  Eddington Fire Department and more than $23,000 to the Denmark Volunteer  Fire Department.

Michaud said Eddington’s grant will cover the  cost of an air supply refill system, and Denmark’s grant will pay for  equipment such as hoses and nozzles. The money is part of the federal  Assistance to Firefighters Grant program.
