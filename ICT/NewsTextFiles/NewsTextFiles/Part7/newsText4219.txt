
ROCK HILL, S.C., May 19, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) announced today its partnership with Level Up Village (LUV) to provide students aged 8 to 12 with STEM-based enrichment and after-school classes that empower them to be global, innovation ready, change makers. LUV offers a range of after-school as well as in-school classes that bring the global and local application of STEM to life. When students take a class in the United States, that class is given to a student living on $2 or less per day at a LUV partner school in places such as India, Haiti, Peru, Pakistan, Rwanda, Uganda, Mali and more. Level Up Village is 3DS' newest partner in its recently announced MAKE.DIGITAL education initiative and online hub that catalyzes innovation and technology learning where educators can access 3D printing resources, curriculums, product bundles and trainings for the classroom.

The Global Inventors in Training package for schools includes a 3DS' Cube® 3D printer, a cartridge, Cubify® Invent Software and Global Inventors in Training After-School Class for eight students, a comprehensive teacher training and ongoing curriculum to allow students to have a real learning exchange in the United States and globally. LUV provides economic incentives for teachers to receive training, and is expected to reach over 120 schools in the United States and 30 global partner schools in 2014.

In a small group setting of eight students, kids will learn how to harness the engineering design process to create innovative solutions to real life global issues. Students in the United States collaborate with global partner schools in developing countries where students live at or under $2 per day and include India, Haiti, Peru, Uganda, Pakistan, and Mali and more. Through video conferencing, each week students discuss the real life application of their learning, teach one another and gain a broader perspective of what it means to be an empathetic, effective global citizen.
