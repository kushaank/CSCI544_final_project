For students planning to pursue medicine, the next two months could be the most important ones.

With the process of admissions under way, experts say students should go the extra mile to ensure that a college is recognised by the Medical Council of India (MCI).

Officials of Tamil Nadu Dr. MGR Medical University and the director of medical education (DME) said MBBS aspirants should definitely check the MCI’s website for the list of approved colleges in the State before seeking admission.

The MCI’s website provides a complete list of medical colleges along with the status of recognition and the number of seats approved/permitted.

He said the university was in the process of updating its list of affiliated medical colleges. “It is risky for students to go ahead and apply to colleges not recognised by MCI,” he added.

The need to double-check recognition of medical colleges has become even more important after nearly 100 students of DD Medical College, Tiruvallur, found that the institution was derecognised in 2011 after they had gained admission and paid heavy fees.

DME S. Geethalakshmi pointed out that MBBS aspirants could also visit colleges and find out from students, details on the infrastructure, faculty, hostel and fees. The DME has begun issuing applications for admission to MBBS/BDS courses since last week. So far, 22,267 forms have been sold, she said.

Last year, admissions were carried out in 19 government medical colleges, 13 self-financing colleges, one government dental college and 17 self-financing dental colleges. Dr. Geethalakshmi added.

A final-year student of the MBBS course in a private college said most often, students made their choice of colleges to apply to during counselling, based on factors such as popularity, proximity and fees. “A simple step of going through the MCI website will give a clear picture and will save them a lot of trouble,” he added.
