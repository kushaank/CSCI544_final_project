
The Sultanhanı caravanserai, located in the central Anatolian province of Aksaray’s Sultanhanı district and known as the largest caravanserai in Anatolia, draws great interest from visitors.

Being built eight centuries ago for travelers during their journeys across the continent, the caravanserai still hosts tourists along the Konya-Aksaray highway plotting their path to Cappadocia.

Sultanhanı Mayor Fahri Solak said the caravanserai was 110 kilometers away from Konya and 45 kilometers away from Aksaray, adding it was one of the strongest structures in the world. “The caravanserai is visited by 400 foreigners and 200 locals in a year,” he added.

The Sultanhanı caravanserai was built in 1229 by Selçuk Sultan Alaaddin Keykubat. Aksaray was an important stopover along the Silk Road route that crossed through Anatolia.

After suffering partial destruction in a fire, the caravanserai was restored and extended in 1278 during the reign of Sultan Kaykhusraw III. The monumental caravanserai then became the largest in Turkey and is one of the best examples of Anatolian Selçuk architecture.

The caravanserai is made up of two sections; one for summer use and the other for winter use. The summer part sprawls over an area of 4,868 square meters and is home to a small mosque.

The caravanserai enjoyed its glory years during the Selçuk period, but lost its importance during the Ottoman era.
