SPRINGFIELD, Mo. -- The kids at Robberson Community School in Springfield had a visitor Monday.

Missouri State Treasurer Clint Zweifel was in town talking about the importance of higher education, and his Most 529 Account and how it can benefit families.

The account is a tax-deferred program that enables families to save for their child's higher education expenses.

Zweifel also spoke to fifth graders about planning for their future, their dreams and investing in themselves.

"I was the first person in my family to walk onto a college campus,” he said. “So I know how important that is for young people. So having doors open for young people in terms on opportunity, is important… savings accounts are important."

Zweifel is visiting elementary schools around the state throughout the month of May.

This was the only stop in Springfield.
