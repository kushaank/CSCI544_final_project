EAST BOOTHBAY, Maine (AP) -- Sixteen Maine high school students will participate in the 25th annual Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Science mentoring program.

The students will begin the program at the East Boothbay laboratory on Sunday. They will work with scientist mentors, collect samples, conduct lab experiments, analyze data and present scientific findings. The laboratory has allowed 400 high school juniors from around the state to participate in the program.

The program began in 1989 when two young scientists and a Bigelow trustee conceived the idea. It is called Keller BLOOM, meaning Bigelow Laboratory Orders of Magnitude Program, in honor of Maureen Keller - a founding scientist who died in 1999.

The students will present their findings to parents and officials at the lab on May 22.
