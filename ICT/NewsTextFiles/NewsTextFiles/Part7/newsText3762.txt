
Council Member Mark Treyger was joined at the corner of W. 31st Street and Mermaid Avenue in Coney Island on Sunday by Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, Assemblyman Alec Brook-Kransy, Council Member Jumaane Williams, the Coney Island Anti-Violence Collaborative and concerned residents to denounce the gun violence that continues to plague the community. The elected officials and community came together a day after two individuals were shot in broad daylight at that location in order to send a message that the neighborhood will not tolerate these acts of senseless violence, and to demand that the city move forward with a comprehensive plan to address the issue of gun violence in Coney Island.

“The fact that yet another shooting occurred in the middle of our community during a weekend afternoon is another reminder of the need to make ending gun violence in Coney Island a major priority for our city. We have a crisis that needs to be addressed through better education, job opportunities, security initiatives, expanded community programs and other resources. I will continue to stand with my partners in Coney Island as we work to provide all residents with alternatives to crime and violence. We must end this epidemic and work towards a better future for our community,” said Council Member Treyger.

· More police resources. This includes additional Parks Enforcement Officers dedicated to Coney Island’s 2.5-mile boardwalk and amusement area, to relieve pressure off the 60th Precinct and allow its officers to focus on the residential areas. In addition, the NYPD must recognize the need for additional security throughout the community all-year around including mobile command centers.

· Focus by the city and NYCHA on job creation initiatives for local residents, including using Sandy recovery funds. “You can’t just react to violence – you must take steps to prevent it. The best way to take a gun out of someone’s hand is to provide them a job and an opportunity for a better life. NYCHA must join this effort by fulfilling its obligation to provide workforce training, especially in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy,” said Council Member Treyger.

· NYCHA once again making its community centers and spaces open and accessible during from morning to evening for all residents, and expanding after-school opportunities for children and teens. Council Member Treyger is requesting that NYCHA take inventory of all common and public spaces to determine how they can better be used to benefit residents.

· The forming by Council Member Treyger of a neighborhood clergy council to bring together religious leaders from throughout Coney Island to develop programs and strategies to end the violence. The launch of this effort will now be expedited in light of the recent shootings.

“This is a national issue and we need to stop the flood of guns onto our streets. I don’t believe that this is a reflection on the community of Coney Island or Brooklyn. This rally shows that everyday citizens are engaged and coming together to say they don’t accept what happened. This is a signal that Coney Island is not going to accept these acts of violence,” said Brooklyn Borough President Adams.

“We need to show our kids that there is light at the end of the tunnel. We have so many great organizations in Coney Island, and today is a testament to that. As a result, Coney Island is now visible again, but we have to finish the job. My thanks to Council Member Treyger and Mathylde Frontus for bringing us together,” said Assemblyman Brook-Krasny.

“Words cannot express the frustration of adding more names to a list of gun violence victims that, unfortunately, continues to grow by the day. My thoughts and prayers are with the two victims and their families. This tragedy that occurred in broad daylight of a residential neighborhood is unacceptable, and requires a forceful response from our city. Let’s not accept as fact that just because we are approaching summer, gun violence has to increase. It doesn’t. I hope that by working with Council Member Treyger and all government agencies, the Task Force to Combat Gun Violence can expand its programs to all areas of the city, so we can collaboratively stop seeing so many incidents like the one we saw this weekend,” said Council Member Williams, Deputy Leader and co-chair of the Task Force to Combat Gun Violence.

“I applaud Councilman Mark Treyger for trying to bring as much resources as possible from the New York City Council to fight this epidemic of gun violence that has gripped communities like ours. His leadership on the issue is not only appreciated but sorely needed as it will take all hands on deck to deal with the gun violence crisis in Coney Island,” said Mathylde Frontus, Founder and Executive Director of Urban Neighborhood Services and Acting Chair of the Coney Island Anti-Violence Collaborative.

Yesterday’s effort to take back the corner of W. 31st Street and Mermaid Avenue included dozens of residents and community groups including the Coney Island Anti-Violence Collaborate, which is a coalition of concerned residents, organizations and stakeholders that includes The Coney Island Step Up Project; Urban Neighborhood Services; Astella Development; Luna Park, The Alliance for Coney Island, Men United for Change, Suber Foundation, Coney Island Generation Gap and the Coney Island YMCA.

Council Member Treyger will continue to work closely with the NYPD, city agencies, NYCHA, business leaders and these organizations to begin putting the programs and resources in place to break the cycle of violence in Coney Island. One priority will be working with Council Member Williams to secure funding to expand the city’s anti-gun violence efforts to Coney Island. He is also hosting a gun buyback program in partnership with City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito on May 31st at Coney Island Gospel Assembly and is calling on Mayor Bill de Blasio to include funding in the upcoming city budget for the hiring of additional police officers. In addition, he is working with NYCHA to get community centers back open to residents and to secure funding for new security cameras.

“The West End of Coney Island has historically been ignored and disrespected and not provided the services needed to break this cycle of violence. The city must recognize this failure and provide the resources needed to keep our residents and streets safe. We can’t just focus on the neighborhood during the summer, when the city reaps the benefits of the amusement area. We must work together to improve the entire community and provide residents with the tools needed to build a better life and stay off the streets. I will continue to make expanding the city’s anti-violence efforts to include Coney Island a priority so that we can finally end this violence,” added Council Member Treyger.
