
NEWARK - U.S. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) did not offer a definitive response when asked on Monday if he would support the re-election bid of state Assemblywoman L. Grace Spencer next year.

A. Amistad. It's about principles, and fights undertaken and won on behalf of the powerless.

B. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. The lead character evokes obvious comparisons to MOST NJ politicians.

C. The Usual Suspects. A bunch of doomed, would-be tough guys are enlisted to carry out the will of one Keyser Soze. 'Nuff said.

E. Valley Forge. It's a little seen 1975 chestnut but is what it purports to be: the portrait of an American hero.

F. American Hustle. It's just too bad those fashions didn't survive to add to the general tawdriness of it all.

G. The Godfather. You doubt the legislature? Clearly, no one would have benefited more from E-Z Pass than Sonny.

H. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. It's a coin toss as to which is more painful: this 'movie' or a Christie town hall.

I. My Cousin Vinny. Prieto's turbulent August caused some to backpedal from the speaker who heretofore were nearly family.
