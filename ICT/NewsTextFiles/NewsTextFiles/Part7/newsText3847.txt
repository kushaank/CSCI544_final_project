
As a Vietnam War veteran, I keep a low visibility during the national holidays. I have had my share of run-ins with individuals with ideas that differed with mine, which at times resulted in abrupt discourse during passing discussions. Seldom do I take offense quietly.

Before I went into the service, I was a quiet, reserved person; I kept to myself. Not quite a loner, but I did enjoy my solitude growing up in New York. But the Vietnam War and the U.S. Army changed all that. The military doesn’t  promote assertiveness, it promotes aggressiveness. Controlled to be sure, it is necessary for survival. Aggressiveness isn’t something that can be turned off easily.

When a vet returns to civilian life, the rigors of military life do not disappear.

During the Vietnam War years, one of the problems encountered at the Veterans Administration was that officials  didn’t want to deal with vets who were ‘whole’—that is, no missing parts.

PTSD—Post Traumatic Stress Disorder—at that time, was not recognized as a condition of combat. “Get a grip troop, get on with your life.” There's always Jim, Johnny or Earl around to help smooth out the night’s bad times—Beam, Walker or Smooth White. Drinking killed the sleep problems, raised hell with the work time, too. Not all vets drank; drugs played a big role, too. Others became homeless because they couldn’t hold down a job to pay the mortgage or rent. One of the symptoms of PTSD is an inability to keep a job. There's a restlessness of working in one place, without some adrenal rush, and the vet quits. All this I know—that’s me.
