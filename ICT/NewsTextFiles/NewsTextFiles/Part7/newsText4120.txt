
Margo Davidson won in historic fashion in 2010 when she became the first African-American, female and Democrat to be elected as state representative in the 164th Legislative District.

Nearly four years later, a pair of challengers — Billy Smith and Dafan Zhang — are seeking to pull off their own historic victory in Tuesday’s Democratic primary.

Davidson, of Upper Darby, is seeking her third term in Harrisburg. She won the endorsement of the Delaware County Democratic Party in February, though committee members nearly voted to hold an open primary.

Unlike her opponents, Davidson also advocates for school choice. She accepted $16,000 during the pre-primary campaign cycle from special interests groups supporting school choice.

He graduated last week from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. He also holds a masters from Penn and a bachelor’s degree from West Chester University.
