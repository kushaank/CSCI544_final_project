
POLICE said there was “no clear evidence” to prosecute due to conflicting accounts about the circumstances of a young man’s death from a drug overdose at an Exeter car park.

The inquest heard that Lee Johnson, 29, from Willey’s Avenue in Exeter was a chronic alcoholic and drug abuser.

His family say he had not used any drugs for the last five years but a few weeks before his death he asked for a Hepatitis C test after allegedly using dirty needles.

In the build-up to his death, Mr Johnson met with two other men and went to the John Lewis underground car park.

They all used heroin but while the other two “came around” Mr Johnson did not. Attempts were made to revive him at the scene and he was taken to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital where he was pronounced dead just after 1.30am on September 4 last year.

Toxicology reports showed a high level of morphine and alcohol in his system. The cause of death was given as morphine and alcohol toxicity.

There were conflicting versions of who did want. One witness said one of the other drug users had injected Lee with heroin while another said he injected himself. But there was no sign he had been physically restrained or involved in a struggle.

Investigating officer DC Tobie Carter said that no-one was prosecuted as a result.

He said: “There was not sufficient evidence to prove someone had administered heroin to Lee and no evidence to support a criminal prosecution.

Assistant coroner Andrew Cox gave a verdict of accidental death.

Really sorry to hear about this man's death. It's yet more proof that this area has a big drugs problem - something painfully obvious to most passers-by in the Sidwell Street/ St James area - but not apparently the police.
