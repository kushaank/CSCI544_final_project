
States schools have bumped up their demands for lectures and talks on ethics for teachers following the case of Erin Tanti â€“ a young, unwarranted, teacher who had an inappropriate relationship with one of his students. Their relationship came to light after 15-year-old Lisa Maria Zahra was found dead at the bottom of Dingli Cliffs. Mr Tanti was found injured a few metres away. He claimed that both had tried to commit suicide, but he survived the 40 metre fall. He is now charged with her murder.

State schools regularly organise Personal Development (PD) sessions for teachers. These sessions are held after hours, usually between 2.30pm and 4.30pm and can cover a wide range of subjects, as indicated by the schools. But this paper is informed that the demand for talks on ethics has noticeably increased following the Erin Tanti case.
