
The wife of jailed PR guru Max Clifford is set to obtain a ‘quickie’ High Court divorce from her disgraced husband tomorrow.

Listings for the Central Family Court in London reveal a series of hearings starting at 10am. One is for: “Clifford J v MF” - Clifford’s middle name is Frank.

Mrs Clifford - who used to work as the publicist’s PA - has enlisted the help of top divorce lawyer Raymond Tooth.

Mr Tooth - nicknamed ‘Jaws’ - has been involved in several high-profile divorce settlements, including Sadie Frost’s divorce from actor Jude Law.

The couple married in April 2010  - seven years after Clifford’s first wife Liz died from lung cancer.

But Jo was noticeably absent throughout Clifford’s trial and has not spoken in public since his conviction.

On the day the guilty verdicts were returned, Mrs Clifford was seen to close to her £600,000 cottage in the Cotswolds village of Broadway without her wedding ring.

Sources close to the pair have previously said that Clifford’s trial was not a factor behind the divorce.

Millionaire Clifford became the first person to be sent to jail as part of Scotland Yard’s Operation Yewtree investigation.
