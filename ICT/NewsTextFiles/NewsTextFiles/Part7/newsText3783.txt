
The storms that ripped through Nebraska on Mother's Day have left more than $20 million in damage according to the National Weather Service.

In what they expect to be their final report, NWS officials say seven tornadoes have been confirmed. The tornadoes touched down in Seward, Fillmore, York and Clay counties on May 11.

The largest have been ranked as EF-3 tornadoes and have left many to pick up the pieces.

On Sunday, over 300 people volunteered in Beaver Crossing, where nearly the entire town was devastated by a tornado.

However, the work is far from done; volunteers and emergency response groups will be on hand again Monday. Interested individuals can call the Seward County Emergency Management office at 402.643.4722 or report directly to the fire hall in Beaver Crossing, located on the southeast corner of Dimery and West streets.

The Army National Guard's 92nd Troop Command is providing safety support until Tuesday.

A Town Hall meeting will be held at the Beaver Crossing on  Monday at 6 p.m. in the community building. The meeting will be opened up for residents following a meeting by the Board.
