
Residents of Wembley Estate in Sector 50, Gurgaon fear for the worst in the near future, with robbery being a main concern. The residents are concerned about it, as security seems to be a major problem, as a result of which the residents even protested for a better security.

The protest took place after a meeting between RWA representatives and the Alok Mittal, Police Commissioner had taken place some time ago. During the time, the commissioner had suggester for verified domestic helpers. But, the main problem of the residents lie with the lax of security. In fact, the security involved in the area seems to have disappointed residents with their unprofessional behaviour.

The CCTV in the area does not work and more shockingly, the guards deployed in the area are mostly found taking naps, which is an invitation for robbers in the area. With such kind of condition, even if a crime takes place in the area, residents would not be even able to the handle the situation then. Thankfully, there has been no recorded robbery in the estate till now.

"Most of the guards deployed at the gate are found sleeping during night. For these inadequate services, each household is made to pay around Rs 5,000 as monthly maintenance," Pankaj Dhar, president of Wembley Estate Resident Welfare Association, reported The Times of India.
