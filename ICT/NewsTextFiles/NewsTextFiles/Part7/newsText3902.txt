
At the grand opening of its US Research and Development Center in Sunnyvale, California, Chinese "search giant" Baidu announced that it has appointed Andrew Ng as its Chief Scientist.

Andrew Ng is also known to hundred of thousands of learners worldwide as co-founder of Coursera, which has become the largest MOOC platform offering higher-education academic courses in partnership with universities.

Ng had been on leave from Stanford and left Google while starting Coursera, which currently has over 600 free courses, over seven million registered students and $85 million in funding. Both founders have now taken on less hands-on roles. Ng moved to chairman and Koller to president in March and Coursera has recently hired former Yale president Rick Levin as CEO.

Now we have three deep learning labs seemingly in competition. Google may have lost Andrew Ng but last year it recruited Geoffrey Hinton together with two of his graduate students, Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskevers. At the beginning of this year Yann LeCun took up his appointment as director of Facebook's new laboratory devoted to research in artificial intelligence and deep learning. So Baidu is entering an already crowded field.

"Baidu Research and its labs will bring together top-flight Chinese, American, and global research talent to advance Baidu's technological leadership. We are confident that our new U.S. R&D Center will help bring the benefits of tomorrow's technology to industry and more broadly to society."

Intel's second webinar about its latest RealSense Technology takes place tomorrow August 20th. And if you missed the first one it is now available online.
