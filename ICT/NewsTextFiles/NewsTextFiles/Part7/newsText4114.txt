
A hundred and three outstanding New Zealand students have been given the opportunity to study at top Asian universities after receiving Prime Minister’s Scholarships for Asia.

Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce says the scholarships, announced by Prime Minister John Key today at a function at Parliament, enable more New Zealanders to gain a deeper understanding of other cultures in countries that are crucial to New Zealand’s future.

The scholarships cover overseas study, research or internships ranging from six weeks to two years at undergraduate or postgraduate level at top institutions in China, Japan, Korea, India and ASEAN countries such as Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore and Indonesia.

Successful recipients include a student from Otago University, who will study chemistry and pharmacology at the National University of Singapore, and a group from the New Zealand Institute of Fashion Technology who will deepen their design and manufacturing knowledge working on a collaborative project with Indian students at a partner institution in Tamil Nadu.

Mr Joyce says the successful recipients will act as ambassadors for New Zealand helping to promote our country, people and the quality of our education system.

Funding of $9 million over five years was provided in Budget 2013 for the PM’s Scholarships for Asia as part of the Government’s Internationally Focused Growth Package and the inaugural awards were made in December 2013.

Applications are now open for the next round of scholarships and close on 28 September 2014. Applications can be made by individuals or groups to Education New Zealand, the lead agency for the promotion of international education.

Amidst the day-to-day reports about the military advances of the Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria, one remarkable aspect of this war has barely been mentioned.
