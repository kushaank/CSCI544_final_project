
KEY ACTION Decided to research an ordinance regarding grass clippings.

DISCUSSION  Councilman Bob Feutz said action needs to be taken about grass clippings being blown onto village streets and alleys.

Feutz said he would like to have ordinances reviewed to see if there are any prior laws governing this issue.

Mayor Cary Petrullo said he has researched existing ordinances and the village currently does not have anything pertaining to clippings.

Solicitor Nicole Stephan offered to prepare a draft of an ordinance prohibiting grass clippings on streets and alleys for review at the June meeting. In the meantime, Petrullo requests that residents take care when mowing to keep clippings off the streets.

• Heard Petrullo report on the cleanup activity performed in honor of Earth Day.

• Approved agreement with the Tuscarawas County Health Department for mosquito spraying, only at the village’s request, for summer.

• Heard Feutz report that the catch basin repair project is underway.

UP NEXT  Regular meeting at 6 p.m. June 9 in village hall.
