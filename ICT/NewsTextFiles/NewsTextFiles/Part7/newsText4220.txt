The tuition-free program engages promising students in the fields of philosophy, mathematics, computer science, linguistics, and other related disciplines. It features three topics in logic and formal epistemology, including the topology of inquiry and causal and statistical inferences.

Hanson first learned of the opportunity when Dan Demetriou, assistant professor of philosophy, and Kristin Mickelson, visiting assistant professor of philosophy, spoke to her about programs for students interested in graduate school.

This program is only one way in which Hanson is preparing for post-undergraduate opportunities. Prior to being accepted to the summer school, she attended the annual Minnesota Undergraduate Philosophical Society Meeting. She also plans to continue work on her senior thesis for graduate school and publications.

The Carnegie Mellon Summer School in Logic and Formal Epistemology will run at the Carnegie Mellon University campus in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, June 220. More information is available at hss.cmu.edu/philosophy/ .
