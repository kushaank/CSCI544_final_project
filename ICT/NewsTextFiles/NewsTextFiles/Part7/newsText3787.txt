
Taita-Taveta, Kenya: A clan on Kenya’s border with Tanzania is still mourning tragedies its ancestors encountered 100 years ago when it found itself at the epicentre of the First World War.

Nearly 100 years after the end of hostilities in 1918, the horrors of the war are still part of local folklore.

This August, some villages will co-host global events marking the start of World War 1 in an occasion that evokes pride as well as sadness.

Most affected at the start of hostilities between German troops, in charge of former Tanganyika and Britain’s military controlling the former Kenyan British protectorate were the Wakasigau, a sub-ethnic group of the Wataita since they were uprooted and banished from their land. To-date, locals are still smarting from emotional pain and other adverse effects of the war.

The war started in 1914 and the first shot that signified its spread to the region was fired at the Taveta District Commissioner’s office onÂ  August 15 of the same year.

The centennial commemoration will be held in August. This international event is expected to promote battlefield tourism as it will attract many visitors.

But what the world may not know is that the locals suffered a lot in the war that involved foreign protagonists.

The agony started after a native by the name Mzoghora went to harvest honey in the forest where he encountered a group of German soldiers who demanded to know the status of their rival British army.

Little did he know what his meeting with these foreigners would later lead to.

Mzoghora, who inadvertently exposed his people to historical injustices, was detained by the German spies until dark when they moved with him to a place called Jora, behind the British troops.
