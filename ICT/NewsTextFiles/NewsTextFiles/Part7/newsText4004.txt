
Suspected members of the radical Muslim group Al-Shabaab on Monday morning hijacked four vehicles transporting cocaine-like Miraa leaves on a road towards Mandera county in Kenya , according to Kenyan police officials.

The al-Qaida affiliated terrorists intercepted the four trucks carrying the Miraa at a road near Kenya's Omar Jillow village. The Somali gunmen hijacked three vehicles with its cargo and set the fourth one on fire after the truck's driver attempted to reverse and speed off from the terrorists' ambush.

Miraa is a shrub with a high content of d-norpseudoephedrine, a stimulant of the central nervous system. It's consumed as a leaf -- in a similar fashion to that of coca of Somalian Khat -- which increases alertness, relieves hunger and fatigue, and produces euphoria, according to Segen's Medical Dictionary.

In addition, on Monday, members of the a local Kenyan security unit, who were traveling to an internal conflict to reconcile members of the fighting Degodia and Garre community , were also ambushed by suspected Al-Shabaab.

Kenyan government officials claim their deployment of soldiers in the nation's south have helped to curb the transportation of explosives to several towns located in southern Somalia. They also claimed soldiers have halted the trafficking of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), counterfeit electronics, and stolen sugar smuggling.

Kenya's top military officers have said that these areas are crucial to returning peace to Kenya's coastal and northeastern provinces.

An armed robbery suspect was shot and killed by police after allegedly stealing what the suspect thought were Oxycodone pills from a nearby pharmacy. Instead of pills, the suspect stole a fake prescription bottle with a tracking device inside.
