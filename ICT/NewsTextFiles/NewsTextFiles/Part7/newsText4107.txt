
Support Our Public Schools, the group leading the home-rule effort in Dallas ISD, was scheduled to argue its case for the initiative at Monday’s DISD school board meeting.

But board president Eric Cowan decided Monday morning to cancel that presentation and has considered moving it to Thursday. At Thursday’s meeting, Support Our Public Schools could present along with Our Community, Our Schools — the largest home-rule opposition group.

Our Community, Our Schools is made up the Dallas teachers groups Alliance-AFT and NEA Dallas, the local chapter of the NAACP and the AFL-CIO. It also has the support of the national chapter of the country’s second-largest teachers union, the American Federation of Teachers.

Several Dallas ISD trustees have complained that Support Our Public Schools launched the home-rule effort without consulting the school board.
