
Orlando is getting a bit of a boost when it comes to wireless data speed and capacity.

Engadget got the scoop Sunday that Verizonâ€™s advanced wireless services nationwide rollout got a new name today: XLTE . The name is actually rather fitting: The new system doesnâ€™t actually increase speeds, but rather increases the capacity of the network.

Boosting the capacity around high-traffic areas like theme parks would improve the experience of tourists and could also help the businesses in those areas with expanded capacity.

Hamby said the towers with the expanded capacity are targeted around tourist hot spots, like the convention center, theme parks and the airport. Itâ€™s also around the Citrus Bowl.

Verizon isn't saying exactly what it spent on the XLTE rollout, which is in Orlando, Tampa and Miami, but that it's part of the $250 million the company has spent on infrastructure in Florida in the last year. Verizon will likely continuing spending about $250 million per year on infrastructure in Florida, Hamby said, and XLTE would be a part of that.
