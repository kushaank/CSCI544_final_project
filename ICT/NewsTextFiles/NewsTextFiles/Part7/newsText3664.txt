
LOS ANGELES, Calif. – Beyonce and Jay Z have released a trailer for a fake movie online with guns blazing, and now fans want to see the film actually made.

Fans launched a petition Monday on Change.org to support a feature-length version of “Run.” The trailer that debuted Sunday stars the superstar couple as gun-toting outlaws. It features cameos by Sean Penn, Don Cheadle and Blake Lively.

Beyonce and Jay Z are sharing top billing for their “On the Run” concert tour that is set to begin next month in Miami.

The couple made news last week for a different video. TMZ posted footage showing a physical altercation between Jay Z and Beyonce’s sister, Solange Knowles. The trio said in a statement they had “worked through” the incident.
