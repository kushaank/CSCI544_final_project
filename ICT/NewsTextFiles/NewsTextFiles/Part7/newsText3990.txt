The township will play $77,000 to install the traffic calmers including costs for signs and markings. Residents who live on the streets have complained that speeding cars pose a danger to their children as well as neighborhood trees and mailboxes.

Six speed humps will be installed on Dalton Avenue between Washtenaw Avenue and Packard Road, four humps will be installed on Dayton Drive between Washtenaw Avenue and Central Boulevard and three will be placed on Cloverlane Drive between Michigan Avenue and Carpenter Road.

The township has tried other calming devices, such as small roundabout on Cloverlane.

“They are the neighborhoods I and my office have been working on for the past four to five years to address concerns/issues around volume and speed of cut-through traffic,” township supervisor Mandy Grewal said.

The roads will remain open during the installation of the humps with partial lane closures throughout the duration of the project, according to a release from the Washtenaw County Road Commission.

The project is anticipated to last about three weeks, but could go longer due to weather conditions. Drivers are requested to reduce speeds and drive cautiously through work zones to maintain the safety of road crews.

Neighborhoods that want speed humps on their roads must first submit a petition to the road commission, which will assess traffic counts and car speed. If the streets meet mandated criteria, 75 percent of homeowners in the impacted area must agree to the installation of calming devices.
