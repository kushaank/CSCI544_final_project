Crime Stoppers is a Pima County Attorney's Office program, but now they have help in Cochise County, and are going from school to school letting students know it is crucial to report suspicious activity.

Those with Crime Stoppers say they know it can be difficult for some students to report things, but 88-CRIME is making it easier than ever for students to report anonymously in one of two ways - calling the tip line at 88-CRIME or reporting it online at www.88CRIME.org .

Authorities are reminding students if there is an immediate threat call 911, instead.
