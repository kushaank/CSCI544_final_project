
BERLIN, May 19 (RIA Novosti) – Russia would like to see concrete details on the financing of future gas payments by Kiev during the next trilateral meeting with officials from the European Union and Ukraine, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said Monday.

“Ukraine has problems as a whole with its economy and ability to pay, so we would like to understand what the future sources of [gas] payments will be. We would like to receive concrete offers in regard to the sources and mechanisms of financial aid to Ukraine," Novak said during a ministerial meeting between Russia and the EU on gas issues in Berlin.

“Ukraine will not manage without foreign aid and Russia is ready to provide support, but Russia is not ready to be here the only country subsidizing [Ukraine’s economy] like in previous years,” Novak added.

The next round of trilateral talks on gas between Russia, Ukraine and the European Union is scheduled for May 26. “We agreed that in a week, during the next consultations, we will discuss issues on financial aid to the Ukrainian party,” Novak said.

The meeting is likely to be held in Berlin, Russian Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak told RIA Novosti.

Ukraine’s debt for Russian gas deliveries has reached $3.5 billion as of the end of April. Russia has decided to switch to a prepayment scheme due to the outstanding bills, in full accordance with the countries’ contract. Following this decision, Gazprom prepared an advance bill for Ukraine’s Naftogaz for June deliveries. In case of non-payment, Russia can suspend the gas supply to Ukraine starting June 3.
