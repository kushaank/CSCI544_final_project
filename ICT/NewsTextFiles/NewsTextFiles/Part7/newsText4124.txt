
LAS CRUCES >> Fifth-grade students at Desert Hills Elementary School held their annual World's Fair celebration in the school courtyard Friday to celebrate the end of their elementary years.

The interdisciplinary topic asks each student to research and become an expert on an assigned country. Family members also prepare a dish native to the students' chosen countries. Students and volunteers get to eat and enjoy the buffet spread after a year of hard work.
