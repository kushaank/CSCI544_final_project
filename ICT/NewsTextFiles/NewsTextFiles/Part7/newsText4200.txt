
Kenya; Education Cabinet Secretary Jacob Kaimenyi has dismissed claims that he ordered fees increment in all public universities.

In a meeting with student leaders from across the country in his Jogoo House office, Prof Kaimenyi said he never issued such a directive.

“Government directives are communicated officially through memos and circulars. No statement or directive, or any documentation has been written to that effect. We are all surprised by the strike notice,” he said.

While referring to a speech he delivered at Bomas on April 23, Prof Kaimenyi said the Government was only considering a differentiated unit cost, where different courses would cost differently.

“We cannot increase University fees without consulting stakeholders, of which students are the major players. That responsibility is with the universities councils,” he said.

Leaders from the National University Students Organisation led by George Bush of Moi University distanced themselves from the strike notice and told Prof Kaimenyi they had called for calm.

Notably missing was the Babu Owino-led Kenya University Students Organisation which the Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang said he had met. Kaimenyi said the matter may have been politicised. He urged the student leaders to give dialogue a chance.

Babu’s group had called for a strike today.
