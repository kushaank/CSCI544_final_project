
A PLYMOUTH school are preparing for a visit next month from Secretary of State in the Department for International Development Justine Greening.

The Conservative MP will be visiting Devonport High School for Girls during her visit to Plymouth on Thursday, June 5 to discover the international activities the school is involved in.

The Secretary of State will see videos and presentations from students and in particular focus on the Connecting Classrooms projects which links to schools in Ghana, Nepal and South Africa and Zimbabwe.

The school was approached by the British Council because Devonport High School is considered a good example of a school with strong international working partnerships.
