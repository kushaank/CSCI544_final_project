Last year, the disease here, had claimed more than a dozen lives. A team of health officials visited Tikri â€” the village which reported fresh cases on Sunday.

"I along with a team of officials from health department visited the village. Things are under control," said chief  medical and health officer, Mandla, Dr K C Meshram. "After the first set of cases were reported on April 13, we conducted surveys. Larvae infected water was found in five houses and the same was destroyed. Precautions are being taken," he said.

Out of the 5 samples that were sent to ICMR laboratories at  Jabalpur, only two have been tested positive, but private laboratories here have tested around 26 people positive.

It is primarily due to this fact that residents are in panic and health officials are taking extra precautions, said sources.
