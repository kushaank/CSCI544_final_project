
SHIMODA, Japan  – Sailors assigned to the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers USS Mustin (DDG 89) and USS John S. McCain (DDG 56) participated in a goodwill cultural exchange at the Inasho Elementary School and Inozawa Elementary School in Shimoda May 16 as part of a port visit to join the city in celebrating the 75th annual Black Ship Festival.

Mustin Sailors were greeted by staff and students at the school where they took part in classroom games and activities followed by a school lunch with the students.

John S. McCain Sailors introduced themselves to the staff and students in the school’s gymnasium, then played a traditional game of Japanese rock, paper, scissors before moving on to individual classrooms for Origami.

Mustin and John S. McCain are two of seven Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers assigned to Destroyer Squadron 15, forward deployed to Yokosuka, Japan, to support security and stability of the Indo-Asia-Pacific region.
