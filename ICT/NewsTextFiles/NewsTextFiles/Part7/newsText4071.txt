
Approximately two weeks ago, a pregnant German shepherd was left at a veterinary hospital in Dallas, Texas.

Just prior to learning of this dog, I had gotten the sad news of the sudden loss of a well known and respected Rescuer in the GSD world. Cathy DuBois worked so hard for this breed and though I had never met her, I had certainly followed her work and had offered her assistance a few times.

I felt saving this dog was a way to honor her and I told the vet clinic I would cover cost of anything she needed while I figured out what to do. Well, the very next morning she began giving birth! 8 puppies total and needed to stay there awhile now.

On Sunday, the mother dog and her newborn pups began their journey to Wolf's sanctuary at Rocky Ridge Refuge.

More newly rescued dogs will be joining the Texas family...a severely neglected Boston terrier mix, and another severely neglected German shepherd/Belgian Malinois who was found in Laredo, Texas, also made their way to Rocky Ridge Refuge this past weekend.
