
The 2014 national Click It or Ticket campaign kicks off on Monday, May 19, and will last through June 2nd. The campaign focuses on keeping the roads safe and saving lives by cracking down on people who don't buckle up.

The Albemarle County Police Department is stepping up its traffic enforcement efforts for the two week campaign: Officers will be focusing more on seat belt use, speeding, drinking and driving and other traffic safety violations.

Officials say speed, alcohol and distractions are the main causes of motor vehicle crashes. Additionally, seat belt use is often a contributing factor in fatal crashes. According to Virginia State Police, in 2012, traffic deaths on Virginia highways were more than double the total number of homicides reported statewide that same year. In 2013, Albemarle Co. Police worked 11 fatal crashes.  So far this year, there have been four fatal crashes in Albemarle County.

Traffic Unit will be visiting high schools to check and encourage seat belt use. Students who are leaving the school properly buckled will receive a free t-shirt which says, "Albemarle County Police Caught Meâ€¦ Wearing My Seat Belt".

The Albemarle Co. Police aim to reduce crashes and fatalities through education and enforcement.
