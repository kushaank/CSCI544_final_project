The University of Georgia recently signed a cooperative agreement with the University of Liverpool. The agreement will further deepen ongoing collaborations between the two universities by specifying joint research activities, faculty and staff exchanges and graduate student exchanges.

UGA Provost Pamela Whitten and Provost Steve Holloway from University of Liverpool signed the agreement in a brief ceremony May 6 in the Peabody Board Room in the Administration Building. Others in attendance were Kavita Pandit, associate provost for international education; Jane Gatewood, director of international partnerships; Robert Scott, associate vice president for research; Alan Dorsey, dean of the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences; and Noel Fallows, associate dean of the Franklin College.

And in 2014, UGA and the University of Liverpool will develop the One Health symposium as part of the International Festival of Business in Liverpool.

UGA and the University of Liverpool entered into a first general collaborative agreement in November 2009 to formalize a partnership in both the biological sciences and the humanities. Research correspondences with Liverpool exist in UGAâ€™s departments including marine sciences, chemistry, infectious diseases and the Institute of Bioinformatics. In the humanities, collaborative research projects focus on African diasporas, migration and identities, and Iberian/Atlantic connections.
