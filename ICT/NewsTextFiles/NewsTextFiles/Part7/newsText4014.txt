
MOST people visit Okinawa for its beautiful beaches.

But it has a darker side that few tourists see, hiding in its caves below.

Located on the southern tip of Japan, Okinawa’s limestone caves were the site of countless deaths during the Battle of Okinawa (1945), the last major campaign of World War II. More than 200,000 soldiers and civilians were killed in the battle, and it was fought extensively underground via a network of caves and tunnels.

The natural coral caves were extended into a huge network of tunnels by the Japanese military in an attempt to gain the upper hand.

And dozens of people committed suicide in the caves, which were also used as bunkers and hospitals, in order to avoid capture by the American troops.

Bones, old water bottles, knives and even teeth have since been discovered in the caves.

But it’s not all doom and gloom inside the caves, which are home to glowing streams, waterfalls and colourful stalactites that are over 300,000 years old.

Some of the 5km-long cave-and-tunnel system has been restored and opened to the public. However the public area extends just 850 metres.

There is a museum and various memorials nearby.
