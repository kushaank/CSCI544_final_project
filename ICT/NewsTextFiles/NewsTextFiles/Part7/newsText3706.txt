
Capetonians can brace for a Cuban-themed lifestyle and comedy festival later this month which aims to put smiles back on “those born with cleft lips and palates”.

Havana Night, is scheduled to run for one day only at Villiera Wine Farm near Stellenbosch in an effort to raise funds for the Cipla Foundation’s Miles for Smiles initiative that aims to improve the lives of those born with cleft lips and palates,

Such well-known comedians as Kagiso “KG” Mokgadi (headline act), Mum-Z, Brent Palmer, Dalin Oliver, and Carl Weber (MC) will perform alongside other artists in support of this worthy cause.

“To capture the spirit of this unique event, the public are encouraged to dress according to the Cuban theme when attending the festival,” said Cipla’s marketing director Rynard van der Westhuizen yesterday.

The event is also inspired by the gruelling 1500km run across the Caribbean country by Cipla Foundation managing trustee David Grier and his running partner, Andrew Stuart.

The pair completed the run, which was also undertaken to raise funds for the Cipla Miles for Smiles initiative, in January.

“We are excited to host this one-of-a-kind lifestyle comedy event inspired by David Grier’s adventure, not only because of the brilliant comic line-up, but also because visitors will be in for a treat with wine, food, music, art, dancers and real Cuban cigars,” said Van der Westhuizen.

“We are thankful to the comedians and artist Louis Storm for seeing the true worth of this cause and donating their time and art to this initiative.
