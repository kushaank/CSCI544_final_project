During last November’s general election, officials opened a tabulation center in Pottstown, where voting machine cartridges from polling places in the county’s western municipalities were tallied. Previously, cartridges from all municipalities were transported to one central Norristown tabulation center, the Board of Elections, and the votes weren’t counted until they reached that destination.

So, during Tuesday’s election, officials are opening two additional remote tabulation centers, in Lansdale and Willow Grove. After the votes are tallied at the three remote sites, they will be electronically transmitted to the central tabulation site in Norristown.

On Tuesday, registered Democrats and Republicans will go to the polls to nominate candidates in their parties for governor, lieutenant governor, U.S. Congress, state senator, state representative and state and local committee people.

Historically, non-presidential elections fail to drive people to the polls and result in lighter voter turnout. During a similar election four years ago, about 20 percent of registered voters in Montgomery County cast ballots. Comparatively, during the November 2008 presidential election, voter turnout was 73.1 percent, according to county statistics.

“I think all elections are important. This particular election is going to define who is on the ballot for governor, for Congress, for state reps and these are the voices we are sending to D.C., to Harrisburg, to make very important decisions on the economy, jobs, our environment — things that will have impact on our communities for years to come,” Richards said.

Rep. Mike Vereb (R — 150th Dist.), chairman of the Montgomery County Republican Committee, expects turnout will be light on Tuesday.

“So unfortunately, we do expect a low turnout in the primary. I look at it as an opportunity for everyone to save their energy for the work we’ll have to do in November to not only retain our House and Senate seats that we currently have but perhaps pick up the 146th District as well as work hard to get Gov. Corbett re-elected,” said Vereb.

Vereb said the GOP used “mailers” to registered voters to encourage voter turnout on Tuesday. He theorized voter apathy might be the result of negative campaigning that voters have observed.

“People are tired of the negative politics. What we have to focus on is educating our electorate on positive points,” Vereb said.

With three of the four candidates vying for the Democratic nomination for governor hailing from Montgomery or Chester counties, local voter officials believe it might result in a brisk regional turnout on Tuesday. Montgomery County residents, Robert M. McCord, of Bryn Mawr, and Allyson Y. Schwartz, of Abington, and Katie McGinty, of Tredyffrin Township, Chester County, are battling Tom Wolf, of York County, for the Democratic nomination.

“I think there will be big interest in that race. I think the gubernatorial is going to bring people out,” said Richards, who is a Democrat.

The polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday. All voters in line by 8 p.m. will be permitted to vote. There are more than 400 polling places in the county.

Typically, the largest crowds show up at the polls before work, between 7 and 9 a.m. and after work at 5 p.m., officials said. By law, polling places must stay open to accommodate voters in line by 8 p.m., whether they’re inside or outside the polling place.

Should a vacancy not be filled by Tuesday, temporary poll workers will be appointed to fill the vacancies.

While most of the focus has centered on the Democratic nomination for governor, there are several other closely-watched primary battles on both the GOP and Democratic ballots.

• In the 13th Congressional District, Republicans Carson Dee Adcock and Bev Plosa-Bowser are battling for the nomination while Democrats Brendan F. Boyle, Val Arkoosh, Marjorie Margolies and Daylin Leach are vying for their party’s nomination. The seat is being vacated by Rep. Allyson Schwartz, who is running for governor.

• In the 8th Congressional District, Kevin Strouse and Shaughnessy Naughton are battling for the Democratic nomination to face incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick.

• In the 146th State House District, there is a battle between former state Rep. Thomas J. Quigley and and Trapped attorney Harvey Friedland for the GOP nomination to face incumbent Democrat Mark Painter.

Rep. Mike Vereb (R — 150th Dist.), chairman of the Montgomery County Republican Committee, expects turnout will be light on Tuesday.

“We obviously would hope for a high turnout for every election. Unfortunately, we don’t anticipate that, at least on the Republican side,” said Vereb, pointing out incumbent Republican Gov. Tom Corbett is unopposed on the primary ballot and that there are only a few GOP primary contests in legislative districts countywide, including the 13th Congressional District and the 146th State House District.

Those who would like to participate as an election worker can do so by contacting the county Board of Elections or their party chairs. Poll workers are paid between $110 and $120, depending on their duties, according to Frank Custer, county communications director.
