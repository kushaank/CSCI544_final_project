
The wife of a convicted paedophile from Worcester Park has denied meddling with the police investigation into her husband.

Wendy Hopkins, 59, of Church Road in Worcester Park, denies intending to pervert the course of justice by tampering with statements in September 2010.

Mobility scooter repairman Michael Hopkins, 63, was jailed for eight and a half-years last August after a jury found him guilty of sexually and indecently assaulting children over a nine year period.

Mrs Hopkins appeared at Kingston Crown Court for the start of her trial today before Judge Susan Tapping who oversaw her husband’s trial.

Prosecutor Simon Connolly said: “Wendy was a very strong matriarchal figure. She stood by her husband and supported him, as it happened, to the end.

She searched for material that would make her husband appear “whiter than white” including anything that would discredit his victims, he claimed.

Mrs Hopkins broke into tears and said: "Lies, it's all lies" as a witness gave evidence against her.

The trial continues.
