
BERKLEY â€” On June 2, Town Meeting voters will weigh in on a 24-article warrant that will address some zoning changes, the Community Preservation Act and other issues.

The meeting will take place at the Berkley Community School gymnasium at 7 p.m.

Town Executive Secretary Paul Modlowski said one article would update the dog control bylaw so that it is more in line with state regulations. Another article will ask voters to authorize a zoning amendment, which would dictate that signs cannot be placed at the same height as rooflines or higher.

Modlowski said that is a change that was supposed to happen at an earlier Town Meeting, but residents and authorities did not get to it.

Calling it an important article, Modlowski said voters will also be asked to authorize an article that would update various flood plain maps around rivers and other areas. The article would also update federal emergency management agency records on flood elevation.

Another article would propose reducing the number of Finance Committee seats from nine to seven. Modlowski said the number used to be smaller, but was increased to nine in recent years. He said the nine-seat board has trouble garnering quorums at meetings.

Another article would allow voters to weigh in on the Community Preservation Act. If the CPA is approved, residents would be charged 1 percent of the annual real estate tax levy. Money raised would allow the town to preserve or maintain various entities, such as historical and/or recreational areas.

With no fire hydrants in town, voters will be asked to approve $400,000 worth of pumper tank equipment for the fire department.

According to Modlowski, financing would cover the cost of purchasing a new truck with a water tank, while the other part of the funding would help vitalize another tanker truck from 1988.
