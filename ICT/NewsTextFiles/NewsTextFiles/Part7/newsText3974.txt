
TIPPECANOE COUNTY, Ind. (WLFI) – Hospital officials have known about the potentially deadly MERS virus for more than a year, and in that time they’ve been preparing.

“We feel like we’re prepared,” said Laura Aschenberg, infectious disease manager at Franciscan St. Elizabeth East Hospital.

Aschenberg said Tippecanoe County and its hospitals participate in emergency preparedness training multiple times a year. She said much of that training is centered around infectious diseases and what to do should it make its way inside a hospital.

Down the road at IU Health Arnett, the same protocol is in place.

Thomas Meyer, an infectious disease physician, said they’ve been going through the training and educating their doctors on the disease for quite some time.

Even though the virus carries a mortality rate of 30 percent, Meyer said he doesn’t want residents to fear. He said because the virus is spread through close contact, he doesn’t believe the virus will become anything widespread.

“[It's] similar to the SARS epidemic a few years earlier in China and Southeast Asia. That never set root in the United States,” said Meyer.

Even though Meyer doesn’t think the virus will become widespread, there are still things you can do to prevent it.

He said residents should treat it like the flu — cover your coughs and sneezes, and always wash your hands.
