
A 10-year-old Montgomery County boy, who’d gone missing after failing to board his school bus on Monday morning, was found unharmed, officials said Monday.

The child, Kevin Salgado, was seen about 8:50 a.m., shortly before he was expected to get on a school bus to go to Harmony Hills Elementary School. But he never boarded the bus and didn’t arrive at school, officials said.
