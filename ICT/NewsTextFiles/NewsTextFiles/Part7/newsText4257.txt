
For millions of students, a college tour means piling into the car with mom, dad, and that bratty sibling already plotting to invade your bedroom. A select few college-bound youths, however, visit schools via private jet—trips that can be much quicker for parents who are strapped for time but not for cash.

Magellan says the business is truly niche, with flights to only a handful of universities each spring, but it’s an important added service for clients who already use the company for regular business trips. The 10-hour card is designed to let groups fly to two or three cities—like the family that visited Syracuse, Northwestern, and Duke universities the same day last spring—or a transcontinental trip to visit a school on one of the coasts. One New York family visited Stanford University and was back home the same day.

Belezerian says Magellan can shuttle families to as many as four cities in the same day, owing to its use of smaller airfields closer to schools. The company also tries to outfit the plane with catalogs and other materials from the school the family is visiting, and occasionally has the college’s T-shirts on board.
