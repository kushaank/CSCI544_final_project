
PRAGUE, May 19 (KUNA) -- Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry and Commerce Abdulmohsen Al-Madaj on Monday hailed as "special and steadily growing" the commercial and economic ties between Kuwait and the Czech Republic.

Speaking to KUNA on the second day of his official visit, Al-Madaj said the State of Kuwait was one of the earliest Arab countries that established diplomatic ties with the Czech Republic, an EU member country.

"Ours is a return visit to the recent visits paid to Kuwait by Czech leaders notably the prime minister; it takes place one year after the two countries celebrated the 50th anniversary establishing the diplomatic ties between the two countries," he pointed out.

The minister, who leads a delegation from Kuwait Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), said: "The delegation aims to explore horizons for expanding the commercial ties with the friendly Czech Republic which boasts a lot of important industries." On his meeting with Czech Minister of Industry and Trade Jan Mladek earlier today, Al-Madaj said the meeting was very constructive, noting that he invited his host and the Czech business leaders to visit Kuwait.

"Minister Mladek expressed interest in strengthening the bilateral ties in the economic and commercial domains. He welcomed the invitation and the date of the visit will be arranged later on," Al-Madaj disclosed.

Al-Madaj is scheduled to meet Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka and Foreign Minister Lubomir Zaoralik tomorrow to continue dialogue on the economic partnership.

"Kuwait, as an open country, boasts a variety of projects that are highly promising for potential partners. The KCCI delegation apprised the Czech partners on such projects and invited them to visit Kuwait to get first-hand knowledge on the development and prosperity of the country," he went on.
