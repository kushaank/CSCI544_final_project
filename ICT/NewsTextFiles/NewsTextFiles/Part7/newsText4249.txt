POINT CLEAR, Alabama -- A drive down Scenic 98 in Point Clear offers up a veritable history of south Alabama lore as heavy as the Spanish moss hanging from the Live Oak branches overhead. Veer off for a cup of Earl Grey at Charming Teacup, and taste a little tradition beyond the bay from across the pond.

Indeed, attending an event hosted by Pendle and her staff is like taking a step back in time, and is a playful dress-up opportunity for little girls and ladies alike.

For ladies, Pendle said, it’s all about the hats.

The tearoom found its way to Point Clear in November 2011, after Pendle’s sister moved to the Eastern Shore and discovered Punta Clara Kitchen, where the tearoom now leases space in the Pacey family’s historic home.
