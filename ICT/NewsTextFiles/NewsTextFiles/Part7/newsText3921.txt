In the general election this time, the TMC won 34 seats on its own, while the opposition votes became divided among the Congress, the CPI(M) and the BJP. Though the CPI(M) has insisted on rigging by the TMC and there were many incidents of violence before the elections, the decline in support for the CPI(M) is not difficult to understand (though it actually got around 30% votes in Bengal as opposed to around 40% garnered by the TMC), given the horrors of its actions towards the end of its regime in Bengal.

Buddhadeb Bhattacharya came to power in 2006 in Bengal with a majority higher than in 2001, and people believed in his ability to bring more industries and create better employment opportunities in the state. But the government resorted to similar oppressions that were trademarks of other parliamentary parties. The CPI(M)’s claim of bring the true representatives of the Left suffered a permanent setback.

These movements are crucial and continuing, despite not only being detached from the party, but also sometimes being directed against it, Nandigram, Singur or Lalgarh, being the most recent examples. It is essential to understand that the CPI(M) party does not have a monopoly over “Left” in India, and neither should it ever have so.
