
'I've Heard Some People Say 'I Had A Special Teacher.' I Have You.'

WUNC is in the midst of a yearlong examination of what it's like to be an educator, called the North Carolina Teacher Project. This week, we're returning to the My Teacher series, exploring what it takes to make a connection in the classroom by asking students to interview their teachers.

The StoryCorps mobile booth left Durham yesterday after a month of gathering conversations from North Carolina to archive at the Library of Congress.

One of those conversations was between a literacy tutor, Kathleen Walchle and her student, Consandra Jones. Consandra says there was always something holding her back from reading and writing proficiently. But that changed when she met Kathleen.

Consandra Jones talks with her literacy tutor Kathleen Walchle.
