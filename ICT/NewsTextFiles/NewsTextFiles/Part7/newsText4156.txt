
WELLESLEY, Mass., May 19, 2014 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Babson College President Kerry Murphy Healey today announced the launch of the Global Scholars Program , offering four-year, full-tuition, need-based scholarships to qualified undergraduate international students who otherwise would not have the financial means to attend the top-ranked business school for Entrepreneurship.

The scholarship program is designed to offer new opportunities for highly qualified international students who will, with Babson's support, lead the next generation of entrepreneurial innovators to create economic and social value across the global marketplace.

The enrollment of a more diverse community of students in terms of geography, culture, country of origin, and socioeconomic status will help all Babson students develop a global mindset and improve their effectiveness as socially responsible leaders. Through the Global Scholars Program, new ideas, perspectives and opportunities will be brought to campus, which the Babson community will then share with the world.

"I can personally testify to the transformative nature of international education," said President Healey. "Leaders who have lived and studied in other cultures are better prepared to meet the challenges of an increasingly mobile and interconnected world. The Babson Global Scholars Program recognizes that entrepreneurship is the powerful force needed to help solve the economic, social, and environmental issues confronting our world community."

Beginning in the fall of 2014, Babson's Global Scholars Program will award four-year, full-tuition, need-based scholarships to qualified international students who otherwise would not have the financial means to attend Babson. The first group of scholars has been admitted and will join the College in the fall. The program will expand to a larger group of students in the fall of 2015.

The Global Scholars Program is intended to attract talented students from outside the United States who will benefit from Babson's mission to encourage new perspectives among peers, increase adaptability in a range of contexts, and expand the reach of living with a global entrepreneurial mindset.

To be considered for the Global Scholars Program, students must apply for financial aid by completing the College Scholarship Service (CSS) Profile form by the stated deadline.
