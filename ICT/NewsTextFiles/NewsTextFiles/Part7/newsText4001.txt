
BEWDLEY, Ont. - The Ministry of Natural Resources is investigating after a live goose with an arrow through its body was rescued Monday.

Lola Good said she first spotted the goose May 11 and has tried to get someone to help the injured animal ever since.

"It was in the pond looking for food and I noticed an arrow sticking out," she said. "To see an animal going around with an arrow through its wing..."

On Sunday, conservation officers Kent Hodgin and Mike Duncan, along with a number of hunters and Cobourg, Ont., resident Bill Thompson, came to the bird's rescue, working in boats and along the shore of Rice Lake, east of Toronto, near Good's house to capture the goose. Since the bird couldn't fly because of the arrow, boats manoeuvred the goose near the shoreline where a blanket was placed over it and it was put in a cage. It took about 30 minutes to rescue the wounded goose and Hodgin said he's extremely grateful for the assistance from locals.

"If I didn't get the help from the local hunters, we wouldn't have been able to capture it," he said.

At first it was thought the arrow was just through the bird's wing, but Hodgin said it is through the bird's body. In fact, he's amazed the goose is still alive.

The goose was taken on Monday to the Sandy Pines Wildlife Centre in Napanee, Ont., to have the rest of the arrow removed. Officials are now trying gto find out who shot the goose.
