
A documentary about the recovery of veteran Staff Sgt. Travis Mills, who became a quadruple amputee after an improvised explosive device took his limbs will be shown at an Orland Park movie theater this month.

Ricardo Fernandez, 48, of Orland Park, is organizing the screening for 7:30 p.m. May 28 at the Marcus Orland Park Cinema, 16350 S. LaGrange Road.

Fernandez, a physical therapist, first met Mills in Peoria when he delivered handwritten “Thank you” cards from children at Stevenson High School to the veteran. He said Mills’ attitude inspired him to bring the documentary before an Orland Park audience.

“I see people with injuries all the time, but I’ve never seen anyone with this severe of injuries with this kind of attitude,” Fernandez said.

Mills lost his arms and legs after an explosion while serving in Afghanistan. The Michigan man is one of five surviving quadruple amputees from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Since the amputations, Mills has become a motivational speaker, actor and advocate for veterans and amputees.

In September 2013, he established the Travis Mills Foundation, a nonprofit that helps wounded veterans.

The documentary, “Travis: A Soldier’s Story,” shows what Mills endured through the loss of his limbs and while in rehabilitation.

“They show his progress through rehab and how he overcomes his injuries,” Fernandez said.

Tickets for the May 28 showing are $10.50 each.
