
A revised masterplan for a major housing development in Nairn has been recommended for approval by Highland Council planning officials.

Springfield Properties wants to build 178 homes at the town's Lochloy, some of them on land previously to be set aside for a primary school.

Council officers said there was no longer a requirement for land to be allocated for a new school.

Councillors will be asked to approve the new masterplan on Tuesday.

Springfield Properties' revised plan also involves one fewer property than originally proposed and also other changes to the layout of the site.
