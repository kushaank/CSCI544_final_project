
TAUNTON — This past Wednesday, the senior interns at Taunton High School celebrated the completion of their internships.

A function was held at Taunton High School where approximately 50 students displayed poster boards and spoke to family, friends, teachers, school administrators and the local community about their internships.

The program is designed to connect the lessons learned throughout the student’s high school education with work-based experience that they learn while working at their internships. The senior interns are hosted by local businesses throughout Taunton. With the help of these internship sites the students ultimately learn if the career path they are interested is right for them.

Not only do the interns learn about their future careers but, through the internship program, they are able to set up resumes and cover letters for their dream job, participate in mock interviews and learn valuable lessons for when they apply for a job.

For the past 10 years, the Taunton High School administration, the city’s local businesses and the senior internship supervisor, Donna Trucchi, have given the Taunton High School’s interns many opportunities to learn about the world outside of high school.

This year, students were placed at local business sites such as the Taunton District Court, Friedman Middle School, Taunton Federal Credit Union, Morton Hospital and Johnson & Johnson, and were also placed throughout the high school, shadowing different faculty members and departments.
