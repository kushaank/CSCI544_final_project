
Gardaí are searching for four men who carried out a carjacking in County Wicklow this afternoon.

A German tourist suffered minor injuries in the incident which happened in Rathdrum at around 2.30pm.

The latest in a spate of carjackings happened in a scenic area of County Wicklow.

A German man and woman, who are on holidays in Ireland, stopped to help at the scene of a road accident in Clara Vale.

A black Volvo and a bus were involved in the crash.  When the tourists went to assist, the men who were travelling in the Volvo took their car - a German registered Mercedes - and took off in the direction of Glendalough.

One of the tourists - a woman - sustained slight injuries in the incident and has been treated in hospital.

The tourists' Mercedes has been recovered in Tullow, Co. Carlow.  Gardai are conducting a technical and forensic examination on it.

They believe the Volvo that was in the crash had been stolen and used in a burglary in Athy earlier today.

Gardaí say that four men were involved in the carjacking and the suspected burglary.

Officers from Wicklow and Carlow are searching for them tonight - along with the Garda helicopter.
