
A "WHO’S who" of government and private sector organisations and personalities is scheduled to participate at the two-day manufacturing indaba that starts on Monday.

Government has highlighted manufacturing as a key sector of economic growth in the National Development Plan and a platform for job creation.

The event, to be held at Emperors Palace in Ekurhuleni, will kick off start with Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of SA (Seifsa) CEO Kaizer Nyatsumba speaking about bridging the government and business "communication deficit".

Seifsa represents 27 independent employer associations in the metal and engineering industries, with a combined membership of 2,200 companies employing some 220,000 people. Members range from steel makers to micro-enterprises employing fewer than 50 people.

Ekurhuleni executive mayor Mondli Gungubele will deliver the keynote address. Kempton Park and other industrial areas surrounding OR Tambo International Airport are seen to be key to SA’s manufacturing development, not least because of the proposed aerotropolis. The sector has declined to about 14% of gross domestic product in recent years, from about 22% in the 1990s.

Government, through its sixth iteration of the Industrial Policy Action Plan (Ipap) released last month is focusing on "smart re-industrialisation". This will be driven by infrastructure development, content localisation, product beneficiation, regional trade integration and exports, and industrial financing.

But Seifsa is concerned about the purchasing managers index figures released this month, saying they indicate that business conditions in the metals and engineering sector and the overall manufacturing industry "remain tough".

Mr Nyatsumba said employers in the sector — most of whom have struggled in recent years — were also "very deeply concerned" about the threat to centralised collective bargaining posed by recent judgments of the Labour Court. He said historically centralised collective bargaining offered employers the "comfort that, once negotiations were concluded, they would not be confronted ... with similar demands that would have the effect of increasing the cost of employment."

Seifsa chief economist Henk Langenhoven said in March that the federation was encouraged by the strong performance of the metals and engineering sector in January, with 4.5% growth year on year. This meant 2014 started on a "much better footing than 2013", he said. But he also said production data was notorious for its volatility.

The indaba will also see the launch of the Manufacturing Circle first quarter 2014 bulletin and survey. This will be presided over by Pan-African Capital CEO Iraj Abedian and the industry body’s chairman, Mike Arnold, who is also group MD of Consol Glass.
