MASON CITY | After corresponding for most of the school year, Lincoln Intermediate fifth-graders were excited to meet their new friends during an end-of-the-year celebration Monday.

Through the Pen Pals program, close to 90 Lincoln students have been writing area residents involved in the Retired Senior and Volunteer Program (RSVP).

Besides Ogbourne, Craun also corresponds with a student at Harding.
