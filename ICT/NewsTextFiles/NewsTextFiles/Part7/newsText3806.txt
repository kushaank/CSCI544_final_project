
CHAMBERSBURG &GT;&GT; At Monday evening's Downtown Visioning meeting, members of the community were asked to contribute ideas on a vision statement.

About half of the individuals in the room had been to previous meetings and there were a few people attending for the first time.

For those who had never attended a meeting before, Julie Fitzpatrick, assistant director and special projects coordinator for Pennsylvania Downtown Center, introduced the project, including some of the strengths and weaknesses addressed at earlier meetings.

Some 317 people had participated in a perception survey, and had expressed their beliefs of strengths and weaknesses, Fitzpatrick said.

Strengths included the historical assets, small businesses, community events and ethnic diversity and weaknesses included lack of communication within business community, safety concerns and traffic congestion.

Fitzpatrick said that a mission statement is the purpose of an organization, while a vision statement talks about the future condition of where the community wants to be.

"We also have to look at market realities," she said. "It has to be inspirational but achievable."

The vision statement that was being worked on included wording that described Chambersburg as a crossroads of flavors, the future and past, activity and healthy living.

Several members of the community debated the wording, including a focus on the future, with some saying that the wording was too "modern."

Some other suggestions were made to highlight some locations downtown such as performing arts and making it easier to walk and bike downtown.

The vision statement and some plans on how to accomplish the ideas will be discussed at the next meeting will be June 16 at 6:30 p.m. at Chambersburg Area Senior High School.
