CLEAR skies, big crowds and a whole lot of fun was the perfect recipe for another successful LifeFest celebration in Tamworth’s Bicentennial Park on the weekend.

The community festival is hosted by the combined churches of Tamworth and co-ordinated by Fusion Tamworth and this year marked its 15th anniversary.

The whole event, from the activities and games to the food and refreshments is free of charge and this year the program was bigger than ever.

A drama group from Sydney entertained the crowds, a Newcastle team brought up a climbing wall. There was an animal fair courtesy of some Loomberah locals, a flying fox for the more courageous, tug-o-war, facepainting, games and lunch courtesy of the churches of Tamworth.

Fusion’s Howard Barnes said up to 3000 people had come through between 11am and 3pm and it was gratifying to see how it had been embraced by people over the years.
