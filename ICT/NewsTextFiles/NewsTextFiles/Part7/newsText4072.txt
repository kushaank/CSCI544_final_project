
Billionaire Kenneth Langone is still defending his comparison of income inequality talking points to rhetoric in Nazi Germany, after apologizing two months ago for the comments.

In a Capital New York interview published Monday morning, the Home Depot co-founder and Republican megadonor said it was a fair analogy to illustrate how democratic elections can yield results he finds terrifying.

A spokesman for Langone did not respond to requests from The Huffington Post for comment.

“If my choice of words was inappropriate -- and they well may have been that -- I extend my profound apologies to anyone and everyone who I may have offended,” he said in the March 19 statement.

Langone said Astorino recently asked him to help fundraise for his campaign, and that he "reminded [Astorino] of the hypocrisy" of asking for help two months after making public statements against him.

Astorino spokesman William O'Reilly confirmed the call to HuffPost, but wrote in an email that the campaign did not ask for money this time.

"We are not shy about fundraising, but this wasn't a money ask call. But, absolutely, the next one could have been. That's how fundraising works," O'Reilly said.

"Also, Rob will always urge officials, friend or foe, to lay off the kinds of comparisons Mr. Langone made. They are always hurtful and never helpful. Langone has clarified his remarks and properly apologized," he added. "That matter is done as we see it."
