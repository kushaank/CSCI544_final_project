
Kenya: President Uhuru Kenyatta has requested best-performing secondary schools to engage in academic exchange programmes in order to help improve education standards.

The Head of State said national schools like Alliance High, which perform excellently, should share the secrets behind their success with other schools.

“Don’t keep what you hold dearly. Let other people learn from what you have,” Uhuru said during a thanks giving ceremony at Alliance.

The President was supporting the request by Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi and Governor William Kabogo to Alliance School management to start such programmes as a way of improving education standards in the county.

They raised concerns that despite the county hosting the best performing school, majority of other schools in the area have been performing poorly. Wamatangi had asked the school management to start an exchange programme where the students from the school can visit others schools in the county.
