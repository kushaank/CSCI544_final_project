
The National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals (NAHREP) has called on the U.S. Senate Committee for housing finance reform, citing increasing constriction of credit as unsustainable for the future.

Hispanic markets are large enough to drive a full economic recovery, but legislation needs to provide a stabile secondary market, according to NAHREP.

In a letter to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs, NAHREP President and mortgage banker Jason Madiedo says that while the current proposed legislation may be on the right track, it does not go far enough to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse home buying market.

“The status quo of the [government-sponsored enterprises] in conservatorship - a system dominated by government support - and increasing constriction of credit simply cannot be sustained.

“NAHREP believes we need legislative reform, and we support S. 1217 with some important caveats. To sustain a liquid secondary market, we’re pleased to see the Bill provides a government ‘backstop’ but clearly intends to put private capital in front of taxpayer risk.

Citing NAHREP’s 2013 State of Hispanic Homeownership Report released last month, Acosta explains, “Since 2010, Hispanics have accounted for a net increase of 559,000 owner households, representing 56 percent of the total net growth of owner households in the U.S.” He says that by 2015, their purchasing power is set to be an estimated $1.5 trillion, which is an increase of $500 billion from 2010.

The agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice eclipses the $13 billion settlement JPMorgan Chase reached with federal and state authorities over similar allegations last November.
