NEW YORK--Abu Hamza al-Masri, the Egyptian-born British cleric on trial in Manhattan, was found guilty of 11 terrorism charges on Monday by a federal jury in Manhattan.

The monthlong trial marks the second time this year that federal civilian prosecutors secured a swift conviction in a high-profile terrorism case. Some critics have contended that military commissions are the more suitable venue for such trials.

The verdict was delivered on the 15th floor of the Manhattan federal courthouse with the newly constructed One World Trade Center visible just a few blocks away.

The case is the second of three terrorism cases to be tried in the Southern District of New York in downtown Manhattan this year. In March, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Osama bin Laden's son-in-law and former al Qaeda spokesman, was found guilty of conspiracy to kill Americans. The trial of three men accused of helping plot the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania is expected to open later this year.

Mr. al-Masri, whose real name is Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. His defense team argued that the government's case was built primarily on a series of inflammatory statements Mr. al-Masri had made--such as comparing infidels to cows and pigs, and declaring it acceptable to behead and enslave them--during his career as a preacher.

The government's case was bolstered by a number of cooperative witnesses who testified against Mr. al-Masri in exchange for witness protection, government stipends and leniency in their own cases.

Faxes, voice-mail messages and phone records further supported the government's claims that Mr. al-Masri played a central role in a 1998 kidnapping of 16 Western tourists in Yemen, an attempt to found a jihadi training camp in Oregon, and the dispatch of recruits to fight with the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan.

The trial's climax came when Mr. al-Masri took to the stand in his own defense, a relatively rare occurrence in terrorism trials. He tangled with Assistant U.S. Attorney John Cronan in a combative cross-examination.

Mr. al-Masri's Finsbury Park Mosque in London was during the late 1990s and early 2000s, a meeting point for some of militant Islam's most notorious figures. Zacarias Moussaoui, 9/11's alleged 20th hijacker, and shoe bomber Richard Reid, were among those to pass through the mosque.

What Mr. al-Masri, a former manager of a London strip club, lacked in theological learning, he made up for with rhetorical flourish. His two missing hands and glass eye--which he told the court he suffered in an explosives accident with the Pakistani military--also gave the preacher the credibility of a battlefield veteran from the Afghan jihad.

"He looked the part of an angry extremist, and I think that contributed to his prominent profile," said Ghaffar Hussain, managing director of the Quilliam Foundation, a London-based think tank that works to counter extremism.

Mr. al-Masri was an early adapter of the Internet and publisher of one of the first jihadi online Web pamphlets. At a time when other prominent hard-line preachers were lecturing in Arabic, Mr. al-Masri drew recruits from London's disaffected Muslim youth by preaching in English, urging them to take up arms against corrupt Mideast dictatorships, and Western Middle East invaders.

In 1998, his own stepson answered the call, going off to Yemen, allegedly to join Islamist antigovernment insurgents, prosecutors said at trial. His stepson was arrested by the Yemeni government.

Five days later, 16 Western tourists were kidnapped and four were later killed during a botched rescue attempt. Just hours before they were nabbed, however, the chief kidnapper, using a satellite phone Mr. al-Masri provided them, called Mr. al-Masri in London and spoke for seven minutes, according to phone records prosecutors submitted as evidence.

The defense had argued that Mr. al-Masri's communications were aimed at negotiating the hostages' release, but prosecutors said that call and those that followed proved he was an active conspirator in that kidnapping plot.

The following year, some of Mr. al-Masri's followers set off for Bly, Ore., where prosecutors alleged--and jurors agreed--they worked on Mr. al-Masri's orders to establish a training camp to prepare recruits to go fight with the Taliban against the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan.
