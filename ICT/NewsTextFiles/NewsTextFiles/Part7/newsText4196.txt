
This is the cheetah who cheated death after he was abandoned at birth by his mother.

The scrappy puss, who has not yet been named, was born at the Wildlife Safari in Oregon on May 8 - the 174th birth at the park since 1972, when their cheetah breeding program began.

But as soon as he arrived, his mother, Moya, appeared to want nothing to do with him, even refusing to clean off the birth sack meaning he would only survive for a few minutes if keepers didn't instantly step in.

Even after safely removing the sack, worried staff realised he wasn't breathing and were forced to act, simulating his breathing artificially.

Luckily, he responded and he was placed in an incubator at Wildlife Safari's animal hospital.

Cheetahs are the fastest land mammal and are built for speed.

They can reach speeds of 70 miles per hour for short sprints and have a deep chest for large lungs and a powerful heart.

There are less than 10,000 left in Africa, with Namibia having the largest population of around 3,000.

The big cats are endangered due to habitat loss, poaching and hunting by farmers worried about their livestock.

According to Wildlife Safari, Cheetahs live for six to eight years in the wild and 10 to 15 years in captivity.
