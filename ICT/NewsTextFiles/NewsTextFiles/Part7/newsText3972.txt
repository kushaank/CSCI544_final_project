
Medford, Ore.--  Jackson County voters have two days to turn int heir ballots for the primary election.

Sunday people were out turning in their ballots at the Jackson County elections office drop box.

"I usually take the time to vote because I think it's very important that we do that," said Karen Whittington.

Jackson County Clerk, Chris Walker said Sunday, the election office has received 30% of the ballots from  voters.

"We expect to double that percentage by the time the election is over. So I definitely feel like we're going to have a 55-60% turnout."

 Walker said this election has generated a lot of interest.

Voters said they are curious to see what happens with those measures.

"I grew up on a farm and so I have been real interested in the non-GMO crops and it's been a real hard decision to make," said Karen Whittington.

I'm interested in the GMO bill to see where that goes and see what happens if it passes and see what the real fallout is of that," said Brian Pahl.

"There are some good issues there. In terms of the GMO agriculture, the libraries," said Buck Smith.

 Walker said  you have until 8 pm Tuesday to turn in those ballots.

 Walker said voters should not mail in  ballots.  Instead to drop them off at an official  drop box location.
