ANGOLA, Ind. - A northeastern Indiana man has been charged with murder in connection with a nearly 13-year-old slaying.

Mark Matthew Fritz was being held without bond in the Steuben County Jail on Thursday following his arrest a day earlier in the slaying of 70-year-old Samuel Hunter of Metz.

Court documents say the 49-year-old Butler man admitted to the slaying in a recorded conversation after undercover deputies posing as friends of his niece drove him to her Ohio home.

The Herald-Republican reports Â Hunter was found dead on June 24, 2001, in a pool of blood in his rural home. His neck had been cut to the bone from behind and the back of his skull had a 2-inch-wide wound.
