
PINE VALLEY (CNS) - A 19-year-old soldier from Pine Valley died over the weekend in a non-combat-related shooting in Amman, Jordan, military officials announced Monday.

Spec. Adrian M. Perkins died in the Jordanian capital on Saturday, according to the Defense Department. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 67th Armor Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, Fort Carson, Colo.

Though the Defense Department did not immediately release further details, Fort Carson's public affairs office told the media that Perkins was shot at a Jordanian military base. He died at King Hussein Hospital.

"We're still trying to determine the details of the incident but can confirm there were no Jordanians involved," a base statement reads.

Gov. Jerry Brown, who said Perkins "bravely gave his life in service to our state and nation," ordered flags at the state capitol to be flown at half-staff in his honor.
