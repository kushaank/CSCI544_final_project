
Mayor Julián Castro is likely headed to Washington to join President Barack Obama’s Cabinet, the Express-News reported over the weekend, leaving a huge vacancy that can only be filled by a current member of City Council.

District 1 Councilman Diego Bernal said this morning that he will not seek the appointment to replace Castro after the mayor departs, but instead look toward possibly making a run for mayor in the May 2015 election.

“It’s a very serious consideration,” Bernal said.

Castro has been tapped to become the next Housing and Urban Development secretary, a story that Express-News columnist Brian Chasnoff broke Saturday morning. An official White House announcement is expected after the FBI completes its vetting of San Antonio’s mayor of five years.

Castro’s successor, according to city charter, is to come from among the current council members.

Bernal believes that whoever is Castro’s immediate successor should not be allowed to run in the 2015 mayoral election.

The obvious question for all who hopped aboard Castro’s “Decade of Downtown” train, is whether the train is approaching its last stop now that Castro is moving north.

For Bernal, he feels among the current council that there is a desire to continue Castro’s plan, which includes adding 7,500 new residential units by 2020, the redevelopment of HemisFair Park, and increasing downtown employment.

“I’m certainly committed to that, and I believe that the entire city has seen the change, has seen the momentum and, there is no appetite stop,” Bernal said.
