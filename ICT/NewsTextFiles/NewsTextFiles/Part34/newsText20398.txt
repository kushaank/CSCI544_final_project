
KATHMANDU: The judiciary has been under fire of late and today it drew fire from some legal experts over Supreme Court’s May 12 judgment in which it had ordered authorities to nominate 26 members for the Constituent Assembly within 26 days.

At an interaction on nomination of 26 members for the CA organised by Democratic Lawyers Association, Khim Lal Devkota, former CA member from the Unified CPN-Maoist, and former DLA president Yadu Nath Khanal said ‘nobody is independent in this country’, while DLA President Gopal Krishna Ghimire went on to term the SC judgment ‘judicial activism’.

The apex court on May 12 had not only ordered the authorities to nominate 26 members within 15 days but also had asked them to choose them carefully, saying that ‘independent personalities should be selected and those who had lost the election must not be picked’.

“Nobody is independent in this country,” Devkota said. “If it requires an independent person, the deposed king should be nominated as a CA member,” Devkota added, stopping short of explaining why he considered the deposed king an independent person and everyone else in this country ‘not independent’.

Senior advocate Bishwokanta Mainali said nomination of 26 members is a constitutional matter and that it should be decided constitutionally. He added that the apex court order to the government to appoint 26 members ‘cannot stop parliamentary proceedings’.

Former DLA President Khanal stated that the judgment smacked of autocracy because the apex court ‘has directed authorities to seek independent persons at a time when nobody is independent in this country’. DLA President Ghimire said the judgment was ‘an outcome of judicial activism’.
