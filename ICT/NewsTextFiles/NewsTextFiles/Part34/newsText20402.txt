
Latest study in carried out in the United States has found that individuals with high blood pressure generally have preference for saltier foods. High salt intake is generally associated with increased blood pressure and higher risk of stroke.

Dr. William White, president of the American Society of Hypertension (ASH), said the findings suggest that people with high blood pressure should rather shift to non-salt spices to their food. He added that adding alternative spices could reduce sodium intake and potentially keep blood pressure under control.

The findings to be presented in New York City at the annual meeting of the ASH declare high blood pressure as silent killer. Main drawback of suffering with the disease is that the patient does not know that he is suffering with some problem as the disease does not show any symptoms in many cases.

Currently, about one billion people are suffering with high blood pressure across the world with 33% of American adults. Patricia Villela, from the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, conducted research on about 118 people in which they offered French bread options with different salt concentrations to different aged group people.

Investigators found that none of the healthy patients preferred to eat high salty bread whereas older healthy group preferred ‘medium salty’ bread. On the contrary, people with high blood pressure preferred ‘highly salted’ bread option.

Researchers concluded that high blood pressure patients prefer to have saltier foods, but their preferences can be overcome by seasoning foods with nonsalt alternatives like oregano.
