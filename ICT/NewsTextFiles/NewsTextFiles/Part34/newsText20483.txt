
Sales of condensed soup drop 3 per cent, while ready-to-serve items fall 1 per cent.

Despite a promotional push, sales of Campbell's condensed and ready-to-serve soups fell last quarter.

ATLANTA—The condensed soup aisle is a lonely place these days.

Campbell Soup Co. cut its annual forecast Monday, saying U.S. shoppers aren’t buying enough soup — especially the condensed varieties that have long been a staple of American pantries. The company now expects sales to grow about 3 per cent, compared with a previous range of as much as 5 per cent.

Campbell, based in Camden, N.J., is struggling to rekindle Americans’ appetite for soup despite a push to promote the products last quarter. While the company’s cooking broth and sauces posted sales gains in the period, Campbell’s condensed soup decreased 3 per cent. Ready-to-serve soups, which don’t require adding water, dropped 1 per cent.

Campbell’s U.S. soup division had a 14 per cent sales gain in the year-earlier quarter, making it tough to maintain growth. Still, the latest performance fell short of the company’s expectations, Morrison said.

Campbell also said that earnings will be at the low end of its previously announced range of $2.53 to $2.58 (U.S.) a share, excluding some items. Analysts were already predicting $2.53 on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company has been working to cut costs by closing two plants and eliminating about 700 full-time jobs.

The problem may be that Campbell’s latest soup offerings aren’t winning over consumers, Erin Lash, an analyst at Morningstar Inc., said in a report. Increased promotions can’t solve that, she said.
