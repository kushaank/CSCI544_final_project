
In Zimbabwe, the gay community marked this month’s International Day Against Homophobia at a secret venue in the nation’s capital, Harare,  because of what they say are on-going state-sponsored security threats in a nation where gay activities are criminalized. FSRN’s Garikai Chaunza attended the event held by  advocates who say the gay community is far from enjoying equal rights in the south African country.

While the International Day Against Homophobia is marked in many nations by public events and official statements about equality, members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community in Zimbabwe held a clandestine gathering this May 17th.

Chesterfield Samba is the director of Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe, or GALZ, an organization that advocates for LGBT rights.

“When we try and host these activities in the cities and wherever it is always the issue about who then will be able to support such events and also issues around safety and security of people that are here,” said Samba.

Male homosexuality is a criminal offense in Zimbabwe and same sex marriage is prohibited by the constitution. Long-ruling President Robert Mugabe often uses anti-gay rhetoric in his speeches.  In his Independence Day message on April 18, Mugabe threatened to expel Western diplomats who publicly promote gay rights in Zimbabwe.

Dutch Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Gera Sneller, spoke to  reporters on the sidelines of last weekend’s  event.

The country’s new constitution, which was adopted last year, guarantees freedom of association and individual privacy.

Human rights lawyer Jeremia Bhamu says the LGBT community should demand their constitutional rights through the courts.
