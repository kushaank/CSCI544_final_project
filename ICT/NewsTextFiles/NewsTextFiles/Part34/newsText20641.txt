
KUALA LUMPUR: Parents need not worry about the health of trainees at the National Service (NS) camp in Dusun Minda Resort, Kuala Nerang, Kedah, amid reports of infection of influenza A (H1N1) on four trainees at the camp.

National Service Training Department director-general Datuk Abdul Hadi Awang Kechil said that so far 54 trainees had been quarantined to stop the spread of the flu.

"I hope the situation is not troubling parents because we have eight medical officers and some staff from the Padang Terap Health Department monitoring the trainees round-the-clock.

"Right now, I advise parents not to visit the camp because of concerns that they might also be infected," he said today.

Abdul Hadi said that as a precautionary measure, all trainees and trainers were provided with masks to be worn at all times and that he will be visiting the camp today to monitor the condition there.

Asked whether the camp, which has 320 trainees, would be temporarily closed, Abdul Hadi said he will discuss the matter with state health officials tomorrow on the next course of action.

The Utusan Malaysia daily today reported that four students tested positive for H1N1.
