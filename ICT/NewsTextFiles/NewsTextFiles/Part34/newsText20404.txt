
PROMINENT Lusaka businessman Andrew Sardanis has said there was a lot of secrecy about the sale of Konkola Copper Mines.

Mr Sardanis said in a statement yesterday that “the generosity to Vedanta, the holding company, during the sale knew no bounds”.

“The Mwanawasa government had been very secretive about the deal. I tried to obtain details about my book ‘A venture in Africa’ but I struck a wall of silence,” he said.

Mr Sardanis said the nation received nothing from the sale.

“Anil Agarwal [Vedanta chairman] received KCM shares against his US$25 million, Zambia Copper Investments got US$23.2 million but the only money Government was allocated is US$16.8 million, which disappeared,” he said.

And Alliance for Democracy and Development (ADD) president Charles Milupi has said the MMD should be held responsible for problems KCM is facing.

He said there was no need for the MMD government to privatise KCM because the mining giant was economically viable after Anglo-American Corporation left.

He said that when Zambians took over the running of the mine after Anglo-American Corporation, KCM’s profits were soaring.

Mr Milupi said on MUVI TV’s The Assignment programme on Sunday that the sale  was at a “giveaway” price and was not appreciated by those who understood mines’ operations.
