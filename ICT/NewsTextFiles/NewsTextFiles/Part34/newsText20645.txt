
Ongoing investigation of the first imported case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in the United States has identified evidence of apparent past MERS-CoV infection in an Illinois man who had close contact with the Indiana MERS patient. The Illinois resident did not seek or require medical care. However, local health officials have monitored his health daily since May 3 as part of the investigation. At this time, the Illinois resident is reported to be feeling well.

The previously reported Indiana MERS patient is a U.S. resident who had traveled from Saudi Arabia and was admitted to an Indiana hospital on April 28; the patient was confirmed to have MERS on May 2, and has since been released from the hospital.

The man did not require medical attention and is said to be in good health. However, as CNN noted, though the revelation does not meet the World Health Organization's definition of an active case, U.S. health officials are still treating it as such.
