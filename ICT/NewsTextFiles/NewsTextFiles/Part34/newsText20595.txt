
The Education Ministry has lodged a formal complaint with the National Labor Commission over the ongoing strike by Polytechnic Teachers.

The ministry is unhappy with the action taken by POTAG leadership to declare a strike and has described the strike as illegal.

Members of the Polytechnic Teachers Association of Ghana are demanding payment of their book and research allowances.

The ministryÂ is, however, yet to petition the commission on the strike of graduate teachers.

Public Relations Officer of the Education Ministry, Paul Krampah, speaking to XYZ News on what the ministry is doing about the ongoing strikes, said the Ministry is taking the issue very seriously.

He added that the Education Ministry is committed to ensuring the concerns of Teachers are addressed in an amicable way.
