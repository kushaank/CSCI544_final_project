
The defense minister in the so-called "Interim Syrian Government" Assad Mustapha resigned over his inability to provide the "rebels with their needs."

Mustapha attributed his resignation to conflicts among the different battalions of the Free Syrian Army, yet the coalition sources asserted that Mustapha's decision resulted from his dispute with the head of the coalition, Ahmad al-Jarba, over financial issues.

The sources clarified that Mustapha asked for his share from the coalition's looted funds and disputed with al-Jarba.

In a different context, the Free Syrian Army and al-Nusra militants controlled al-Zamla town, which lies 60 km away from al-Raqqa, after fierce clashes with ISIL (The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant) terrorists.
