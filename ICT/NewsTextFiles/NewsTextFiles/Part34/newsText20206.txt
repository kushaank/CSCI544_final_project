
NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh took responsibility for the Congress's crushing defeat in Lok Sabha elections, saying he, being the head of the government, was responsible for all shortcomings.

In the meeting of the Congress Working Committee, Singh said, "I take responsibility for whatever shortcomings existed at the government level. We were not able to communicate satisfactorily with the people on the issues of price rise and corruption, and the situations that arose because of it."

Singh opposed the resignations of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and party vice-president Rahul Gandhi. "Resignation is no solution to the problems faced by the Congress," he said while lavishing praise on Sonia for giving him a free hand in running the government.

"The work and efforts you both put, the support you gave to run the government was extraordinary," he said.

A resolution adopted by CWC, importantly, said that the onus for the failure lay as much with the government as with the party, bringing Singh into the discussion on apportioning of blame for the massive defeat.

Even as he took responsibility for the failure on part of the government, the CWC meeting to discuss the Lok Sabha defeat became another moment of glory for the outgoing PM.

The Congress chief appreciated Singh's stewardship during the past 10 years. "His task has not been easy, especially with having to manage coalitions, the economic slowdown and variety of other issues. And he has done so with dignity and grace, at times in the face of hostile personal attacks," Sonia said.

She noted that the UPA government led by Congress was the first government since 1960 to be elected for two successive terms.

Even as she admitted that anti-incumbency was normal for a government with 10 years in office, Sonia blamed the opposition for polarizing the campaign.

"I also believe that the massage of Congress was lost in the din and dust raised by an aggressive and polarizing campaign by our opponents, which was backed by unlimited resources and a hostile media," Sonia said.
