
Islamabad, Pakistan has begun ‘back-channel diplomacy’ with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is all set to form India’s next government.

Pakistan’s High Commissioner in New Delhi Abdul Basit has quietly been in contact with the BJP to convey Islamabad’s willingness for ‘meaningful engagement’ with the new government, officials said.

According to the Express Tribune, sources said that Basit delivered a message on behalf of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s government that it was ready for a ‘new beginning’ with the BJP administration.

A source familiar with the development said the BJP leadership was informed that the current government in Pakistan was following a policy of ‘economic development and peaceful neighbourhood,’ the report said.

The source said that the Foreign Office (FO) seems optimistic of a positive development after initial contacts with the BJP.

According to the report, the hard-line BJP’s win has led to fears that the new government in India may take a tough stance towards Pakistan.

However, Prime Minister’s Adviser on National Security and Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz said BJP’s clear majority could help New Delhi in taking ‘decisive and positive’ decisions.

He added that the government was optimistic about the relationship with India as the BJP’s manifesto was economy driven and sought good ties with neighbours, the report added.
