
DAVENPORT — An out-of-state political action committee that ripped Republican Senate hopeful Mark Jacobs earlier this month is up with a new television ad backing state Sen. Joni Ernst of Red Oak.

It’s not clear who is paying for the advertising. American Heartland PAC has filed two reports with the FEC, but neither report lists any contributors. Still, the filing and the new ad ties the PAC closer to Ernst, who trails Jacobs in fundraising but has benefited from outside groups criticizing the wealthy retired energy executive.

American Heartland PAC filed a statement of organization with the FEC that lists as its treasurer a lawyer in Washington, D.C. The committee has not responded to requests for information.
