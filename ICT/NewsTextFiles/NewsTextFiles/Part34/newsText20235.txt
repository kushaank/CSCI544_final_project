However, hydrologist Elmer Caringal of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said that the drop in the water elevation of Angat Dam should not be a cause for panic as the rainy season would likely hit the country at the end of May or first week of June.

The National Water Resources Board (NWRB) cut the water supply of concessionaires Manila Water and Maynilad when the El Nino phenomenon last struck the country in 2010.

Even if there would still be rains during El Nino, Maynilad and Manila Water already have contingency plans depending on the amount of raw water supply that the NWRB intends to supply to them.

Cherubim Ocampo, Maynilad spokesperson, explained that changes on the water service are dependent on the allocation that the west zone water concessionaire will receive.

Maynilad’s reservoirs can now hold 533 million liters of water compared to the 281 million liters in 2010.

The other water concessionaire has decreased water pressure during peak hours as part of its contingency plan.

Caringal said that costumers should not worry as the current water supply situation is a lot better than that in 2010.

At present, La Mesa Dam is the other reservoir that supplies water in Metro Manila.
