
Guam - After a month of investigation following a possible arson at the Yigo composting facility, the Guam Fire Department issued a stop order and a notice of hazard to Guam Cleaning Masters, the private contractor in charge of the facility.

For two weeks now, the Yigo composting facility has not been able to receive any more green waste because according to Acting PIO Fire Fighter II Kevin Reilly, Guam Cleaning Masters was issued a stop order and a notice of hazard.

Reilly said in addition, the facility in Yigo must show its fire and safety standards comply with the GFD'S requirements.

Reilly said, "Guam Cleaning Masters was issued a notice of hazard and a stop order. The notice of hazard was because of the way they improperly stored the vegetation and green waste while the stop order prohibits them from receiving any more. On our side, the GFD investigation is complete. It's been turned over to EPA for any finds or anything that might be levied against the company."

With the investigation revealing the fire was incendiary, EPA Administrator Eric Palacios said Guam Cleaning Masters is permitted by EPA to conduct compost in the area but not permitted to conduct open burning.
