
Nakuru, Kenya: Jubilee supporters in Nakuru town took to the streets to protest disparaging remarks made by CORD leaders against President Uhuru Kenyatta during a public rally in Kibera at the weekend.

Hundreds of party supporters blocked the busy Nairobi-Nakuru Highway waving placards andÂ  chanting slogans denouncing the CORD leaders.

The peaceful demonstration organised by Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri and Nakuru Town East MP David Gikaria brought business in the town to a standstill.

Kimani said Inspector General of Police David Kimaiyo should arrest leaders who insulted President Kenyatta during the weekend rally.

“Why has Kimaiyo not taken action against those who insulted the President during the rally? Freedom of speech does not mean disrespecting the Head of State and we are not going allow them to continue using abusive language,” the Bahati MP said.

The MPs accused the opposition of working in cahoots with Western powers to destabilise the Jubilee government.

Gikaria challenged the opposition to make good its threat to impeach President Kenyatta, saying the Motion would flop.Â  “We defeated them at the ballot, we again defeated them in the Supreme Court and we will overwhelmingly shoot down any attempt to impeach the President,” the MP added.
