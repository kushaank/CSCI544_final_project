This editorial has been changed from its original version. The Worcester meeting is from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday, May 20.

If you have nothing better to do Tuesday between  6 p.m. and 8 p.m. — a job, perhaps? — you might want to head over to the Central Massachusetts Regional Planning Commission's offices at Worcester's Union Station and let the state Department of Transportation know what you think of higher fees for most functions at the Registry of Motor Vehicles.

You know, the fees MassDOT directors already approved in March, and which are scheduled to take effect July 1.

Sure, it's possible that the state will modify, delay, or even rescind some of the increases, but don't bet on it. The fees haven't been raised since 2009, and the increases are expected to generate between $55 million and $63 million in fiscal 2015, money that MassDOT is already counting on.

For whatever it's worth, we can accept the need for increases in the fees for road tests and motor vehicle inspections, both of which pertain to actual changes in status — the licensing of new drivers, and ensuring that existing vehicles meet safety and emissions standards, respectively.

But we'll never see the logic for biannual registration of motor vehicles in the absence of any changes in ownership or address. Massachusetts enacted so-called lifetime registration of vehicles under the administration of Govs. William Weld and Paul Cellucci. That system worked fine for consumers, but not for the state's revenue-gathering purposes, so lawmakers later reimposed the two-year registration requirement.

Perhaps someone at MassDOT really will be reading and weighing the public input. But just to be on the safe side, we suggest you have your checkbooks ready come July 1.
