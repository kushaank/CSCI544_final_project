SANAA – A suspected Al-Qaeda leader has been killed in Yemen's central Al-Bayda' province, a military source said Monday.

Gelabeeb al-Yamani was killed in an operation aimed at flushing militants out of the province, the source, who was quoted by the Defense Ministry's website, said without elaborating.

Yemen recently launched an offensive against suspected Al-Qaeda elements in the country's south, where the group continues to stage sporadic attacks on army and police personnel.

Dozens of people have been killed in intensified fighting between militants and army troops in recent weeks.

Yemen has been dogged by turmoil since pro-democracy protests in 2011 forced autocratic president Ali Abdullah Saleh to step down after 33 years in power.

In the three years since, authorities have struggled to maintain law and order.
