
During the 6th century BC, Corinth was one of ancient Greece's richest cities thanks to it's twin ports and strategic location for trade. It was sacked by the Romans in 146 BC for rebelling against Roman rule and rebuilt by Julius Caesar in 44 BC, once again becoming a prosperous port.

It was here that St. Paul spent 18 months preaching to the Corinthians, who loved to pay homage to the goddess of love in her sacred temple, partying with the temple's sacred prostitutes both male and female.
