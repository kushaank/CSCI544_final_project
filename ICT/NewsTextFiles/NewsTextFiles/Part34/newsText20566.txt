
Fighting between government soldiers and Tuareg rebels in the northern Malian city of Kidal at the weekend has left at least 36 dead and almost as many civil servants hostage, the government said Sunday.

"During the fighting, eight members of the armed forces were killed and 25 were wounded while 28 of the attackers were killed," the defence ministry said in a statement, adding that around 30 civil servants were being held hostage.
