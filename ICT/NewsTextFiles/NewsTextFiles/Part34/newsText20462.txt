The grants, all between $1,000 and $2,000 and made available through the Forestry Department’s Volunteer Fire Assistance program, are designed for the purchase of equipment to fight brush and forest fires.

“The VFA program provides vital funding to the many volunteer fire departments that assist us with the suppression of wildfires across the state,” said John Miller, director of VDOF’s resource protection division.

Area companies receiving grants include Little Fork ($1,000), Rapidan ($1,500) and Reva ($1,500) in Culpeper County; Amissville ($2,000), Castleton ($1,113.23), Sperryville ($1,500) and Little Washington ($1,318) in Rappahannock County; and Madison ($1,000) in Madison County.
