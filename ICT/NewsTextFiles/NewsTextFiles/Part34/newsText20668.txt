
provisions of Section 4(2) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894  (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act of 1894'). In some of the  writ petitions, while issuing post admission notices to the  respondents, this Court as an interim measure restrained  the respondent State from taking over physical possession  over the land under acquisition. The State Government,  however, did not choose to take over possession of the  land from any of the petitioners, who are the land owners  of the land subjected to acquisition.

question. In view of the interim order passed by this Court,  the amount of compensation was not paid to the petitioners  immediately after acceptance of the award but at a  subsequent stage the same was offered and on being not  accepted, the same was deposited in the court of Civil  Judge (Senior Division), Sriganganagar. According to the  respondents, looking to the lis-pendent the possession of  the land was not taken and for the same reason the  compensation was also not paid, thus, the protection given  under sub-section (2) of Section 24 of the Act of 2013 is  not available in the instant matters.

the Act of 2013 is available to the petitioners who are  having possession over the land in question because of an  interim order passed by this Court and further that the  awarded compensation has already been deposited before  the court competent court as per provisions of Section 31  of the Act of 1894.

Provided that where an award has been made            and compensation in respect of a majority of            land holdings has not been deposited in the            account     of    the    beneficiaries,     then,      all            beneficiaries specified in the notification for            acquisition under Section 4 of the said Land            Acquisition      Act,    shall    be      entitled     to            compensation in accordance with the provisions            of this Act."

to 1st January, 2014, the day on which the Act of 2013 came  into force, but the physical possession of the land has not  been taken, or the compensation has not been paid. A  liberty is also given to the State to initiate the fresh land  acquisition    proceedings     for    such    lapsed   process     of  acquisition, but that should be in accordance with the Act  of 2013.

legislature had any intent to exclude the application of  sub-section(2) of Section 24, then that should have been  mentioned in the clear terms, as that is provided under  Section 11-A of the Act of 1894. The Section 11-A of the  Act of 1894 provides a definite period for making an award  and the explanation given below the proviso to Section 11-  A states that in computing the period prescribed for  making an award shall exclude the period during which any  action or proceedings to be taken in pursuance of the  publication of the declaration made under Section 6 of the  Act of 1894. No such exclusion is given under Section 24 of  the Act of 2013.

statute by adding something to it, which has not been  introduced by the legislature.

It is quite pertinent to note that the draft rules  for the Act of 2013 were put to in public domain for  discussions on being notified on 14.10.2013. The Rule 23  of   the   working   draft   was    relating   to   retrospective  application of Section 24 and as per proposed sub-rule(3),  where possession of the land under acquisition was not  taken due to the acquisition process challenged in a court  of law, then the period spent under litigation was to be  counted for the purpose of determining the period of five  years, necessary to have operation of sub-section(2). The  Rules were notified in gazette on 31.12.2013.          The sub-  rule(3) aforesaid of the working draft was not included in  the gazette notification. This non-inclusion clearly indicates  that the Rule making authority was also not interested to  take into count the period that spent under litigation. For  abundant caution, it is made clear that the rules referred  above have yet not been came into force but reference of  those has been given only to indicate the intention of the  rule framing authority.

even upto 1.1.2014. This factual position clearly indicates  that sub-section(2) of Section 24 of the Act of 1894  operates in the instant matters and by application of that  the proceedings initiated under the Act of 1894 are to be  treated lapsed.

The    upshot   of   the   discussions   made   is  acceptance of the application, accordingly the same is  allowed. It is declared that the land acquisition proceedings  initiated under the notification dated 23.8.2004 stands  lapsed in view of the provisions of sub-section(2) of Section  24 of the Act of 2013. In light of the declaration made  above, all the writ petitions stand disposed of.               No order to cost.
