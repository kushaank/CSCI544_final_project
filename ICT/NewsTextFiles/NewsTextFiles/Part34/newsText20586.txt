
COEUR d’ALENE, Idaho (AP) — Coeur d’Alene officials are employing a new fire-protection strategy — goats. Two hundred hungry goats were released Friday over 22 acres of Tubbs Hill, the popular park that overlooks Lake Coeur d’Alene.

They chewed through shrubbery and mowed down other fuels that could help a fire spread. Coeur d’Alene Fire Department Deputy Chief Glenn Lauper says it takes fire officials 20 minutes to reach a fire on Tubbs Hill’s south side.
