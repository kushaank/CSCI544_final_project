(TRNS) - A Mississippi man faces 25 years in prison after he was sentenced Monday for attempting to poison the President, a senator, and a judge.

James Everett Dutschke, 41, of Tupelo, Mississippi, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Sharion Aycock on charges of making and possessing biological lectin ricin that was placed in letters mailed to President Obama, Mississippi Senator Roger Wicker, and Justice Court Judge Sadie Holland.

Letters to President Obama and Sen. Rogers were intercepted in April of last year. While Judge Holland received her letter, she was not harmed.

Dutschke was initially arrested in April 2013 and indicted by a federal grand jury in June, followed by a superseding indictment in November. Dutschke pled guilty on January 17, 2014 in order to avoid an imminent lifelong prison sentence.

Dutschke was also sentenced to serve a 5-year term of supervised release.

Ricin, commonly found in the seeds of a castor oil plant, can kill in small doses.

Dutschke’s life-threatening letters were part of an alleged plot to frame Elvis impersonator and Mississippi native Paul Kevin Curtis. Dutschke placed clues in the letters that directly linked to Curtis and led to his initial arrest by the FBI. However, after questioning and further investigations, Curtis was released and evidence began to suggest that Dutschke was behind the attempted poisonings.

WOW! This girl is a great reporter! Can’t wait to see more!

I’m glad the reporter saved me the time I would have had to research this ‘thickened plot’.  So he was setting someone up, hoping to incriminate another.  Thanks Ms Sullivan!
