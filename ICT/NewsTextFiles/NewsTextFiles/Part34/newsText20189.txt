
Four members of the Asia New Zealand Foundation’s Leadership Network will expand their knowledge of Asia-New Zealand relations after being awarded Prime Minister’s Scholarships for Asia.

The Prime Minister’s Scholarships for Asia are funded by the New Zealand government and support tertiary students to spend between six weeks and two years undertaking study or research in Asia.

The Asia New Zealand Foundation launched its Leadership Network in 2006 to foster a group of young people dedicated to building understanding and knowledge between New Zealand and Asia. The network now has more than 350 outstanding young people in New Zealand, Asia and beyond.

Asia New Zealand Foundation deputy executive director Adele Mason says the Foundation has made the Leadership Network one of its priorities in the past few years, and has provided its members with a range of professional development and experiences in Asia.

“It’s great that the quality of the Leadership Network has been recognised with these scholarships. We look forward to seeing these impressive young people further deepen their understanding of Asia.

Laura Browne (Auckland), who will conduct research in China towards her Master in Commerce, majoring in international business, at the University of Auckland. Her research will examine the experiences, business models and strategies adopted by New Zealand primary sector businesses with an Asia focus, and the factors that have secured their success in China. “The outcome sought will be not only a piece of academic research but a compilation of experience useful to other businesses looking to do business with China,” Browne says.

Oliver Ibbetson (Wellington), who will spend a year studying Chinese in Kaohsiung, Taiwan before embarking on a two-year global MBA programme in Taipei. Ibbetson became interested in learning Chinese after the Asia New Zealand Foundation sponsored his attendance at the Seminar for Youth Public Participation in Taipei last year, where he maintained a number of connections and friendships. “New Zealand is well set up for the Asian Century, and I hope that my time in Taiwan will allow me to be part of that change”.

·         Jordan King (Wellington), who will study a Master of Arts in China Development Studies at the University of Hong Kong. “Over the coming years we will see China grappling with significant political, financial, environmental and social policy challenges associated with a shift towards a consumption-driven economic model,” King says. “This MA programme will help me gain real insight into the magnitude of change in China and how this will impact on New Zealand.” He hopes to work for a China-focused public sector organisation once he returns to New Zealand.

·         Hayden Montgomerie (Wellington), who will study a Master of Business Administration at Assumption University, Bangkok, Thailand. He plans to focus on ASEAN economic integration in 2015 and creating opportunities for increase New Zealand-ASEAN cooperation in international education. “I believe that studying for an MBA in Asia, and specifically in Thailand, will provide me with the cross-cultural and international environment for me to build my skills for the future.” Ultimately, he hopes to develop and lead new business relationships between New Zealand and the ASEAN region.
