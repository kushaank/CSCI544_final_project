
An Illinois resident who recently tested positive for the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is not contagious and cannot spread the virus to the general public, according to officials from the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH).

The Illinois patient is believed to have contracted the virus from the first U.S. MERS patient, who was treated for the disease in Indiana after catching the virus during a trip to Saudi Arabia. Health officials think that the Illinois resident caught the virus from the Indiana patient during a 40-minute business meeting, which involved no more contact than a handshake.

If so, it marks the first time the virus was transmitted from person-to-person within the United States.

The Illinois resident was diagnosed on May 3, as part of an investigation following the confirmation of the virus in the man from Indiana.  The patient from Illinois is reportedly feeling well and did not seek any medical attention.  Health officials will continue to follow up with the patient, as well as anyone else who had close contact with the Illinois patient.
