
Kenya: Three Jubilee MPs have asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to unmask the faces behind the Anglo Leasing scam before Sh1.4 billion is paid out to two firms.

Njogu Barua (Gichugu), Julius Ndegwa (Lamu West) and James Bett (Kesses) said they supported the Sh1.4 billion payout but demanded that the Head of State first reveals those involved.

Speaking at Kiamugunda Catholic Church in Gichugu constituency on Sunday, the legislators said it was imperative for the country to know who was being paid the money.

“The Government should go ahead and reveal those behind Anglo Leasing, and we will marshal support in Parliament to ensure the President has our support,” Barua said.

They noted that most of the contracts worth Sh5.6 billion had already been paid by the previous regime.

“It is hypocritical for CORD leaders to keep on criticising everything the President does in relation to the scandal yet they were part of the Government that paid billions,” Ndegwa said. Bett said the opposition was deliberately trying to embarrass the President.
