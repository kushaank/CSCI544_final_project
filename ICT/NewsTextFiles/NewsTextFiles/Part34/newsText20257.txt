
Two civilians and six Malian officials have been killed in the northern city of Kidal, the UN peacekeeping mission said Sunday, without giving details on the circumstances of the deaths.

"The special representative of the secretary-general and chief of MINUSMA, Albert Koenders, condemn in the firmest manner the killing of the two civilians and six Malian officials from the governorate of Kidal," the UN peacekeeping force said in a statement.

It is unclear if the killings were related to the fighting between separatist militants and the Malian army which left 36 dead.

The statement gave no details on the date of the killings. Neither was there any information about the identities of both the victims and the perpetrators.

When contacted by AFP, MINUSMA declined comment and no Malian official was immediately willing to comment on the statement.

"This barbaric crime is totally unacceptable and those responsible must answer for their action. An investigation must be carried out rapidly in order to verify the facts and bring those responsible before justice," Koenders said in the statement.

"MINUSMA supports all efforts towards this end," he added, concluding his statement with condolences to the Malian government and to families of the victims.

According to the government, eight soldiers and 28 insurgents were killed in Saturday's fighting outside the regional governor's offices during a visit by Malian Prime Minister Moussa Mara to the desert town.

Around 30 civil servants were also being held hostage, said the government, which has blamed the clashes on Tuareg separatists.
