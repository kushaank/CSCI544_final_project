
Executive Director of the World Food Programme (WFP) Ertharin Cousin arrives in Pyongyang for talks on continued food aid to the impoverished state.

The head of World Food Programme (WFP), Ertharin Cousin, arrived in Pyongyang on Monday for talks on food aid.

North Korean officials were seen at the airport greeting her delegation, in footage filmed by state media KCNA, which could not be verified by Reuters.

The U.N. food agency, the main distributor of food aid in North Korea said it provided emergency food aid worth $3.2 million for children and pregnant women in the country in February this year.

However, it said it will close five out of its seven factories within this month that produce nutritious biscuits due to a lack of funding amid an apparent donor fatigue over North Korea's missile and nuclear programmes.

Cousin said she hoped that WFP can continue operations in North Korea.

"Well I am hopeful that we can meet with as many officials as possible to talk about the WFP programme, this is a very important time for us. We find ourselves in a very difficult financial position and we're very concerned about our ability to continue operating here without additional support from the government to make sure that we meet the needs of those that we serve," she said.

WFP said its operation seeks to assist 2.4 million of the most vulnerable women and children, as well as vulnerable families in the most food-insecure parts of the country.

Chronic food insecurity affects two-thirds of the country's 24 million people, the Assessment Capacities Project said in April 2013.
