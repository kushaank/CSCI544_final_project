
Whether you want to or not, we’re forced to pay into Social Security and Medicare. But today’s working Americans don’t have the guarantee that these programs will be there to carry us through retirement. Why? The taxes we’re paying now are supporting today’s retirees – not tomorrow’s. And Congress may change the benefits, especially since these programs are significantly underfunded.

Ideally, we would have the option to save our own money in the way we want – and government programs would be the safety net they were supposed to be, to protect America’s vulnerable from poverty.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is speaking out on this critical issue of financial security. He is spot on that our entitlement programs, namely Social Security and Medicare, cannot continue as they are . They won’t last for another generation at the benefit levels people have become accustomed to.

The Thrift Savings Plan is the right type of plan for retirement investing – but Boccia says another government-controlled plan isn’t the place to put the millions of American workers who don’t have their own employer-sponsored retirement accounts. Heritage has advocated an Auto-IRA (individual retirement account) that would help get more people saving.

Heritage experts have said that it would be helpful to extend automatic-enrollment IRAs to those who don’t have this kind of option at work right now.

This would be a win-win for workers. And it would move retirement savings back into our pockets and away from government-managed programs.
