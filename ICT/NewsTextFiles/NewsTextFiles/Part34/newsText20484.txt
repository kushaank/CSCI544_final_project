
The condensed soup aisle is a lonely place these days.

Campbell Soup Co. (CPB) cut its annual forecast today, saying U.S. shoppers aren’t buying enough soup -- especially the condensed varieties that have long been a staple of American pantries. The company now expects sales to grow about 3 percent, compared with a previous range of as much as 5 percent. The news sent the stock down 2.3 percent.

Campbell, based in Camden, New Jersey , is struggling to rekindle Americans’ appetite for soup despite a push to promote the products last quarter. While the company’s cooking broth and sauces posted sales gains in the period, Campbell’s condensed soup decreased 3 percent. Ready-to-serve soups, which don’t require adding water, dropped 1 percent.

The shares fell to 44.06 at the close in New York , marking the biggest one-day drop since Feb. 3. The stock has risen 1.8 percent this year.

Campbell’s U.S. soup division had a 14 percent sales gain in the year-earlier quarter, making it tough to maintain growth. Still, the latest performance fell short of the company’s expectations, Morrison said.

Campbell also said that earnings will be at the low end of its previously announced range of $2.53 to $2.58 a share, excluding some items. Analysts were already predicting $2.53 on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company has been working to cut costs by closing two plants and eliminating about 700 full-time jobs.

The problem may be that Campbell’s latest soup offerings aren’t winning over consumers, Erin Lash, an analyst at Morningstar Inc., said in a report. Increased promotions can’t solve that, she said.
