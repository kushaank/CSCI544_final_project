
MCLEAN, Va.--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Global satellite solutions provider SES Government Solutions (SES GS)        will offer O3b services on their General Services Administration (GSA)        Schedule as of June 30, 2014, making them the first distribution partner        to offer the O3b capability directly to the U.S. Government.

The O3b next-generation Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) constellation of        satellites offers customers affordable connectivity for up to 1.6 Gbps        throughput and fiber-like latency (less than 150 msec). The first four        satellites were launched in June 2013. The second four are scheduled for        launch in July 2014, with another four scheduled in early 2015.

SES GS provides global fixed and mobile satellite solutions in the        geosynchronous (GEO) orbit. By combining this capability with O3b’s MEO        offerings, SES GS offers government customers the benefit of having one        provider for fixed and mobile GEO satellite service with broad coverage        and complementary MEO satellite service with high throughput over O3b        coverage areas. This combination will provide connectivity for customers        in remote areas where terrestrial fiber infrastructure is not available        and low-latency applications are required.

O3b provides connectivity to support troop welfare, time critical high        bandwidth traffic, disaster recovery and maritime operations. The O3b        constellation offers continuous coverage. Each beam is connected to a        high throughput teleport providing reliable, high-speed, low latency        broadband at a reduced cost. O3b currently provides a vast coverage        area, including Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and        Australia, with a collective population of over 3 billion people. O3b        began commercial services in the Cook Islands in March 2014.

SES Government Solutions and O3b will present their capabilities jointly        at the upcoming Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, May 19-22, 2014.        More information is available in Booth #202.
