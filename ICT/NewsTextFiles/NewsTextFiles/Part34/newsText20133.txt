
As federal regulators review a proposed merger between Comcast Corp. and Time Warner Cable , the New York State Public Service Commission will also scrutinize the deal valued at approximately $45.2 billion.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday that the PSC will take a look to see if the deal is in the best interest of Time Warnerâ€™s New York customers and the state as a whole. Time Warner Cable provides digital cable television, broadband Internet and VoIP telephone service to approximately 2.6 million subscribers across the state, including much of Western New York.

Cuomo referenced a new legislation that he signed in April. Under the new law â€“ like gas and electric utility mergers- the burden has shifted to the cable companies to demonstrate that the transaction is now in the public interest.

Cuomo also requested the PSC to review how the proposed merger will impact state policies, such as its efforts to expand broadband in under-served areas and providing better broadband access to schools. The PSC will critically review the protections being offered to low-income customers as well as how the proposed merger might impact consumer pricing and telecommunication competition overall.

If the merger goes through, Comcast will have approximately 30 million subscribers in the United States.
