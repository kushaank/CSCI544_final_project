
TOMSK, May 19 (RIA Novosti) – The European Union will work jointly with Russia as part of the Geneva deal to resolve the crisis in Ukraine and plans no new sanctions against Moscow, EU Ambassador to Russia Vigaudas Ushatskas told journalists on Monday.

“We are not promising any sanctions, we are interested in working with Russia on agreements which we have jointly reached, such as the Geneva deal and the OSCE roadmap,” the diplomat said.

“These are principle documents which oblige Russia, Ukraine and the EU to assist the de-escalation of the situation, so that disarmament occurs and the May 25 election in Ukraine takes place, which is an important and positive step for Ukraine’s development,” he added.

The EU added two Crimean companies and 13 individuals to a Russian sanctions list last week over the escalating situation in Ukraine. In total, the EU sanctions now target 61 people, including high-ranking Russian officials.

The EU has said it has a three-stage sanctions process. The third stage, not yet reached, would be broad economic sanctions against entire sectors of the Russian economy.

Members of the European Parliament have urged limiting cooperation with Russian energy companies, including halting construction of the South Stream project, which is planned to deliver Russian natural gas to Europe via a route bypassing Ukraine. The resolution came as a voluntary recommendation.

Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt earlier said whether or not EU foreign ministers consider new sanctions against Russia will depend on the situation in Ukraine, and in particular the upcoming May 25 presidential election.

Moscow has repeatedly stated that the language of sanctions is “inappropriate and counterproductive” and warned its Western partners about the “boomerang effect” that sanctions would have.
