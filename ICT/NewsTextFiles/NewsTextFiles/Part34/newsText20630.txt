Claims that untreated veterans have died premature deaths have turned a scandal into a full-blown crisis. In the past 24 hours, Rep.  Adam Kinzinger , former House Speaker  Newt Gingrich , and former Sen.  Bob Kerrey  have added their names to the  growing list  of politicians calling for Shinseki to step down. Over two weeks ago, both The American Legion and Concerned Veterans for America  called for  Shinseki's resignation.
