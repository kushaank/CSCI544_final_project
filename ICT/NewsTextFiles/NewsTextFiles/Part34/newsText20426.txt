
Lavin, who served as Quinn's chief of staff from December 2010 to October 2013, launched a lobbying firm back in February that recently secured the above-mentioned clients. Lavin was the governor's chief of staff at a time when Quinn was making decisions on issues such as scaling up gambling in the state as well as the legalization of medical marijuana.

"I think that's probably something to look at," State Sen. Darin LaHood (R-Dunlap) said of Levin's new lobbying gig. LaHood is at least one state lawmaker in favor of beefing up Illinois' "revolving door" prohibition.

The state's revolving door measure prohibits specific current or former state officers or employees from being employed by or taking compensation from an entity that is not the state if the employee in the year prior to leaving state employment awarded state contracts or made regulatory or licensing decisions that directly impacted the entity,  according  to the Illinois Executive Ethics Commission.

Brooke Anderson, a spokeswoman for Quinn, told the Pantagraph that, "Mr. Lavin consulted with both the Office of the Governor's General Counsel and Ethics Officer prior to his departure from the state."

"When Gov. Quinn took office, he enacted a strong new ethics code and we expect everyone to comply with it," she noted.
