
WASHINGTON DC— South Africa’s Constitutional Court on Monday heard arguments in the landmark Zimbabwe torture case, which was brought by two non-governmental organizations seeking to compel Pretoria to investigate allegations of torture committed in 2007 by Zimbabwean government officials including cabinet ministers and members of the security services.

But the South African authorities have gone for six years appealing the ruling arguing that arresting Zimbabwe officials will strain ties with Harare.

Reacting, Prosecutor General Johannes Tomana told VOA Studio 7 that Zimbabwe is unfazed by the processing arguing that it is a sovereign state.

Efforts to reach South African officials were futile. Zimbabwe Exiles Forum director, Gabriel Shumba, said he is confident the Constitutional Court will rule in their favor.
