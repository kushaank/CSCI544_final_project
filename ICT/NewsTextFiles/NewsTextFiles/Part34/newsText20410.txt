NEW YORK (CBSNewYork/AP) – What happens when you invite Vice President Joe Biden to your prom? Chances are he won’t show. But he doesn’t ignore it, either.

That’s what happened when Talia Maselli invited Biden to her high school prom in Newington, Conn.

The student reached out last September, knowing Biden’s dance card would likely fill up.

“As the months passed I figured he never saw it, he’s not going to respond,” Maselli told 1010 WINS.

Last Thursday, the day before the prom, Maselli received a handwritten card and a corsage — baby’s breath, white roses, and red, white and blue ribbons — from the vice president.

Biden’s office said he was touched and flattered by the invitation and personally picked out the corsage so Maselli would feel special.

In the note, Biden apologized for not being able to go to prom with her and invited Maselli to meet him at the White House.

Biden’s office is arranging for Maselli and her family to meet with the vice president in July.
