A former senior clerk in the Palm Beach County Health Department has been sentenced to two years in federal prison for identity theft involving patient information.

A federal judge imposed the sentence last week on 31-year-old Salita St. Simon of Belle Glade. St. Simon also was ordered to pay more than $19,000 in restitution and serve two years' probation after her release.

Court records show St. Simon used her access to a health department database to steal patient information, including dates of birth and Social Security numbers. Prosecutors said St. Simon stole identifying information of 1,858 people, which others used to obtain fraudulent federal tax refunds.

St. Simon previously pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy and one count of illegally obtaining individuals' health information.
