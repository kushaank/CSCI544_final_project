
PESHAWAR: Pakistan Flour Mills Associations (PFMA) Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) on Monday urged Punjab government to lift ban of inter-provincial transportation of wheat.

In a press conference here at Peshawar Press Club President of PFMA Anis Ashraf warned that if Punjab government would not heed their appeal they would block export of flour from Punjab flour mills to Afghanistan via Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

He said ban over inter-provincial transportation of wheat from Punjab has hampered operation of about 300 mills in KP and left thousands of workers unemployed.

He said that earlier the exporters from Afghanistan were purchasing flour from KP mills but due to unavailability of flour at KP mills that Afghan exporters had started purchasing flour from Punjab directly.

PFMA president said the ban has made it difficult for KP government to achieve buying of 4,50,000 ton wheat to meet food demand of the province.

He lamented that terrorism had already affected KP industries and many industrialists have shifted their business to other provinces, adding that in such a situation the problems of KP province would further aggravate if the ban was not lifted by Punjab.

Anis Ashraf and other representatives of PFMA appealed to KP and Punjab governments to find amicable solution of the issue and give a support to already declining industry of KP.

PFMA representatives Naeem Butt, Haji Musarrat Shah, Momin Khan, Ghani Khattak and Malik Khan were also present on the occasion.
