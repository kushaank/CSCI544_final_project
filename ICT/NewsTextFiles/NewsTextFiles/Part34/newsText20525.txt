
KUALA LUMPUR, May 19 (KUNA) -- Singapore has started talks to conclude the Trans-Pacific Agreement (TPPA) in the presence of Ministers of Commerce and officials representing 12 (TPPA) member countries on Monday.

According to Singapore media, six countries have sent their ministers, while the other six sent top negotiators and governmental officials to participate in the meeting attended by US Trade Representative Michael Froman.

The countries could not reach an agreement on concluding the deal during their last meeting on February. US President Barrack Obama, whose country is leading the deal, is eager to reach a final agreement on the matter.

During his previous visit to Malaysia, last April, Obama has noted that this agreement is vital to all member countries, a statement which came after Kuala Lumpur's refusal to sign the deal.

Moreover, Obama has also failed to conclude the agreement upon his visit to Japan, while his efforts to convince his Asian partners that Washington's desire of a wider influence in the Asia-Pacific region would not negatively affect its relations with China.

The agreement would initially aim at reducing about 90 percent of the tariff between member countries until it eliminate tariff all together by 2015.
