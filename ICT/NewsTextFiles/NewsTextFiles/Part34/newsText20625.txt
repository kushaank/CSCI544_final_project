
The Environmental Health Department's Air Quality Program has issued a health alert due to smoke causing elevated levels of matter in the air.

Satellite imagery shows smoke from the Skunk Fire in eastern Arizona heading toward the Albuquerque area Monday.  Forecast models show smoke may arrive this evening and could linger through Tuesday morning.

While these conditions persist, the following actions are recommended, especially for individuals sensitive to particulate pollution: avoid heavy exertion, stay indoors as much as possible, and keep windows and doors closed.

If needed for comfort, use air conditioners or heating systems on recycle/recirculation mode.  Avoid using swamp coolers that can circulate outdoor air inside.

If symptoms occur, including severe coughing, difficulty breathing, wheezing, chest tightness or pain, palpitations, nausea, unusual fatigue or lightheadedness, contact a health care provider. If conditions are creating a health emergency, call 911 or seek medical attention at the nearest medical facility.
