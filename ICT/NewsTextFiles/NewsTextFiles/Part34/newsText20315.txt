
"[The merger] looks like a head-scratcher," Eddie Hold, vice president of connected intelligence at research firm NPD Group, told Tom's Guide. Buying a satellite company when satellite TV is generally in decline may seem like a counterintuitive strategy, but Hold maintained that AT&T wanted DirecTV's know-how and subscriber base more than its tech.

There may be some advantages for existing subscribers in seeing AT&T and DirecTV work together, since it will help bolster AT&T's video content and DirecTV customers' access to high-speed broadband. AT&T already offers a combination of TV, home phone and Internet service through its U-verse service, but the company does not serve some of the nation's largest markets, including New York. DirecTV serves many of these markets, but doesn't have high-speed Internet. The combined company could package some of its services with DirecTV subscriptions to offer current subscribers a better deal.

Although the idea of AT&T working hand in hand with a TV provider may seem like a threat to streaming online video, such as Netflix and Hulu Plus, the two fields are still quite distinct. "[Customers want] more streaming solutions and the same linear [cable or satellite] TV options you have today," Hold said. No customer wants to replace Netflix with traditional TV because Netflix is just too darned convenient. They want both services to work in tandem, and AT&T and DirecTV will be sensitive to that, or risk losing business.

If AT&T slows down Netflix, it will probably do so to earn extra money, rather than to protect its new satellite business. If the Federal Communications Commission can't make its new Net neutrality proposal work, AT&T could slow Netflix connections until the streaming service pays for preferential treatment, as it has done with Verizon and Comcast.
