A San Marcos firefighter has been battling California’s wildfires for a week. He posted a picture of him and his team on Facebook over the weekend.

The picture has caught a firestorm of approval and gratitude. People are saying they are struck by the sheer exhaustion they see on the firefighters in the background with men resting on grass, on concrete and even a utility box.
