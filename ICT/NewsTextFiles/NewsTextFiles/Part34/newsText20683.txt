
FRANKFORT, Ky. (May 19, 2014) – The Kentucky Labor Cabinet reminds all employers in the commonwealth that required labor law posters are available for free at its website, labor.ky.gov . Private companies are sending notices that offer to sell these posters to businesses.

Employers failing to post required posters may be subject to citations and penalties, but letters sent to Kentucky businesses have threatened civil and criminal penalties up to $17,000 if they do not display certain posters being sold. Some employers may be misled into believing that these notices are official government warnings. While certain posters are required by law to be posted in the workplace, the Kentucky Labor Cabinet, as well as other Kentucky agencies and the U.S. Department of Labor, provides these posters free of charge.

The Labor Cabinet provides required posters for child labor laws, wage discrimination because of sex, wage and hour laws, and safety and health on the job guidelines. The Labor Cabinet also provides these posters in Spanish.

In addition to the Labor Cabinet posters, there are also two other mandatory posters for employers within the commonwealth. The Kentucky equal employment opportunity poster is provided courtesy of the Commission of Human Rights, and the unemployment insurance benefits poster is provided by the Office of Employment and Training. Links to those posters are also available on the Labor Cabinet’s website, labor.ky.gov .

There may be federal posters certain companies are required to post. Please check the U.S. Dept. of Labor website here for those posters that may apply.
