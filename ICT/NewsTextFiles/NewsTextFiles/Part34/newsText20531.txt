Carpenter was an automatic rifleman serving with 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines, Regimental Combat Team 1, in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, on Nov. 21, 2010.

The then-lance corporal was manning a security post with another Marine when a hand grenade landed nearby. Carpenter threw himself on the grenade, according to a Marine Corps report, shielding his fellow Marine, Lance Cpl. Nicholas Eufrazio, and taking the brunt of the blast.
