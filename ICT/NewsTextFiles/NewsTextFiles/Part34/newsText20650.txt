The Florida Department of Health is warning residents about a viral mosquito-borne disease.

Officials have received reports of three Floridians who recently traveled to the Caribbean and contracted chikungunya fever.

The disease is transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. It has been documented in 40 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas.

The cases in Florida include a 30-year-old woman from Miami-Dade County; a 29-year-old woman from Broward County; and a 44-year-old woman in Hillsborough County.

Symptoms typically begin three to seven days after being bitten and include fever and severe joint pains, often in the hands and feet.

The Health Department advises residents to wear repellent and drain water from any garbage cans, pool covers and other items that might have collected rainwater.
