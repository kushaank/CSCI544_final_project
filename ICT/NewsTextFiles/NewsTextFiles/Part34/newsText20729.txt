
Pretoria - The ANC’s National Executive Committee (NEC) is expected to start discussing who will become the premiers in the eight provinces it controls at its special meeting today.

This NEC meeting could also deal with several other big decisions, including who will be the new Parliamentary speaker.

One of the key questions officials will have to decide is who will be the premier in Gauteng.

It appears President Jacob Zuma and other people on the ruling party’s NEC want Nomvula Mokonyane to serve another term.

But the Gauteng ANC hasn’t included her name on the shortlist they submitted to the NEC.

They’ve nominated provincial secretary David Makhura, housing MEC Ntombi Mekwe and Education MEC Barbara Creecy.

In 2009, the provincial party wanted Paul Mashatile to become premier, but the NEC overruled it and appointed Mokonyane instead.

The NEC may also discuss who will be the new Speaker of Parliament amid claims that ANC chair Baleka Mbete could return to the post.
