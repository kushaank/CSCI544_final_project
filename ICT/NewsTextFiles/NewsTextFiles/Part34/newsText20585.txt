
And moving onto Libya.

Heavily armed gunmen tried to storm the main parliamentary building in the capital city of Tripoli on Sunday, however they were forced to the retreat after facing resistance from security forces.

Authorities say it's still unclear who is behind the chaotic attack.

Eyewitnesses say the attackers were from the Zintan Brigade of former rebel fighters.

But those loyal to the renegade army general Khalifa Haftar have also claimed responsibility.

The anti-government rebels are demanding that parliament be suspended and power given back to recently elected officials.

With at least 70 people killed this past week, the country has seen some of the worst fighting since Muammar Gaddafi was removed from power in 2011.

The government remains in limbo as a new Constitution has yet to be written with various factions vying for control to determine what kind of state Libya should become.
