
Laughlin residents will soon lose medical care options. University Medical Center is on track to close its Quick Care Clinic in Laughlin on May 30. UMC is making this move to shed four of its satellite clinics, as part of an effort to stem millions of dollars in financial losses.

But Laughlin town advisory board members are concerned that the closure will leave Nevada Medicaid patients and other residents without essential services.

The facility, which provides a local choice for the treatment of non-emergency issues and primary care cases, has been operating in Laughlin since 1999. At the time, the board of county commissioners approved the transfer of $1 million from Laughlin’s operating fund to secure the medical clinic. The clinic’s closures will force the community of 7,300 residents to seek treatment from the town’s only doctor or look for care in Las Vegas or over the river in Bullhead City, Arizona.
