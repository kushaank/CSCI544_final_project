AMMAN, JORDAN — More than 13,000 troops from 24 countries are to take part in the annual Eager Lion military exercise in Jordan, state news agency Petra said Sunday.

It said ground, air and naval forces comprising a total of more than 13,000 troops are to be deployed during the May 25-June 10 wargames, with around 24 countries taking part.

The maneuvers are aimed at tackling terrorism and insurrection and to prepare armies to develop their capacity to plan and carry out joint operations, the agency added.

Some 8,000 troops from 19 countries including the United States, Britain, Egypt, France, Iraq, Turkey and Saudi Arabia took part in last years Eager Lion exercises in the kingdom.

Jordan borders Syria, where a three-year-old civil war has killed 150,000 people and displaced millions, with nearly 500,000 taking refuge in the kingdom.

Washington has voiced concern over the effects of the war on Syrias neighbors, particularly its strategic ally Jordan, and it has sent more than 1,000 US troops to the kingdom.
