PAWTUCKET, R.I. — The 73-year-old man with the smile and tanned face who got out of the Tacoma truck Monday morning in front of the Pawtucket Fire Station Monday was nothing like the man firefighter David Reed had faced in the days just before Christmas in 2012.

He was off duty at a Christmas concert at Emanuel Episcopal Church in Newport when he heard a man gasping for breath. Jerry Jones, of Texas, who was at the concert with his son who lives in Portsmouth, was having a heart attack and collapsed.

Reed identified himself as a member of the Pawtucket Fire Department and went to work. He opened Jones’ airway, checked for signs of choking and then started CPR while waiting for the Newport Fire Department to arrive.

On Monday, Jones visited Reed at the Pawtucket Fire Station on Roosevelt Avenue to thank him for saving his life.

“If it wasn’t for this guy, I wouldn’t be here,” Jones said.
