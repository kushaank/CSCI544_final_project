The United States has indicted five Chinese military officials accused of hacking U.S. networks and stealing information, a move that represents the first legal swipe against international cyber theft.

Accusations against the Chinese of infiltrating the networks of U.S. companies and government agencies is not new, but this specific indictment charges that Chinese cyber spies target U.S. power companies to steal trade secrets for economic benefit to China-based companies.

The defense industrial base also is a well-known target of cyber espionage, particularly when it comes to the designs of weapons systems and aircraft. Some say the problem is deeply rooted, including in the cultures of the U.S. and China.

Its an issue that goes well beyond schooling, Duckworth added.

Back in the U.S., some Defense Department officials and cyber experts seemed to laud the Justice Departments actions, including at the National Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, Colo., where Air Force Space Command CTO Bill Marion called the indictments a very positive thing. Others, however, cautioned that the impact of the indictments remains to be seen.
