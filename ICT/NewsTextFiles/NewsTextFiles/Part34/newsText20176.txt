
BRUSSELS — Dutch state-owned bank ABN Amro hit its key financial targets in the first quarter, giving a boost to its plans for a stock market return six years after it was bailed out in the financial crisis.

A flotation would mark a turning point in the fortunes of the bank and of the domestic economy, as well as removing the bank from the hands of a government with no interest in owning a major bank in the long term.

Announcing first-quarter results on Friday, the lender said its cost-to-income ratio had improved to 58% in the first quarter from 65% last year, showing the effect of cost cuts, while its return on equity rose to 10.9% from 5.5% before one-offs last year, in line with its 2017 targets on both counts.

The two measures were identified by chief financial officer Kees van Dijkhuizen as important in determining whether the bank was fit for a stock market return.

He said that to justify a positive message to the government on a flotation, ABN Amro would have to make serious progress toward the goals it had set for 2017, which were for a cost-to-income ratio of between 56% and 60% and a return on equity of 9% to 12%. The company will offer its advice to the Dutch government about the listing in October or November. The government would then determine by the end of the year whether to proceed with a flotation next year.

Mr Van Dijkhuizen said the result of the European Central Bank’s "health check" on bank finances, designed to ensure lenders are secure enough to withstand another financial meltdown, would be important in clearing the way for a float.

"The asset quality review will have a strong influence," he said, adding a flotation may have to wait until the second quarter, after the release of the bank’s 2014 results.

However, CE Gerrit Zalm, a former Dutch finance minister, said a good first quarter was not necessarily a guide for the whole year.

"We caution not to extrapolate the Q1 results to the end of the year, as Q1 is traditionally the best quarter of the year and because the bank tax is due in the final quarter."

ABN Amro reported a 30% rise in first-quarter underlying net profit and said loan impairments would take some time to fall to normal levels, although they should be slightly lower this year.

Underlying net profit rose to €378m as higher margins on deposits led to increased interest income and expenses barely rose.

Loan impairments remained elevated, reflecting the weak state of the domestic economy. At €361, they were 39% above year earlier levels, although an improvement of 35% from the final quarter of 2014.
