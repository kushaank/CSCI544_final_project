
PINEDALE – A new report from the Tax Foundation, an independent Washington, D.C.-based tax policy research organization, found nearly 40 percent of Wyoming’s revenue comes from the federal government.

Wyoming received 39.7 percent of its general revenue from the federal government in fiscal year 2012, making it the sixth most dependent state on federal aid. At 45.8 percent, Mississippi was the state that received the biggest part of its revenue from the federal government, followed by Louisiana (44.3 percent), South Dakota (41.5 percent), Tennessee (41.3 percent) and Missouri (40.8 percent). Alaska was the state that received the least amount of federal aid, with only 20 percent of its general revenue coming from the federal government, the report reads.

Wyoming receives money from the federal government in many ways. One of the most recognizable forms of federal transfers is the payment in lieu of taxes (PILT) program, which gives money to counties with large areas of federal land that would have otherwise been collected on property taxes. In fiscal year 2012, the state received $25.3 million from PILT.
