
A Syrian court has brought some 30,000 lawsuits over acts related to "terrorism" in the past two years, a pro-regime newspaper in the war-torn country said yesterday.

Among those accused were around 300 citizens of Arab countries other than Syria, said Al-Watan newspaper, which is close to the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.

"Some 30,000 lawsuits are being heard by the court, including 300 cases (involving) Arab citizens," the daily said, adding the charges were related to "carrying out terrorist acts".

Since March 2011, the Assad regime has been fighting an uprising in which it accuses all of its opponents -- ranging from non-violent activists to rebel fighters -- of being "terrorists" backed mainly by the West, Turkey and the Gulf states of Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
