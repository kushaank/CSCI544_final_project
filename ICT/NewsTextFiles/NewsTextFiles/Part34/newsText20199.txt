
New Delhi: JDU leader Nitish Kumar on Monday exuded confidence that his party will form the government in Bihar and continue the good work. Kumar reiterated that he took the onus of the party's debacle in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and resigned as Bihar Chief Minister.

"I did not take the decision of resigning as Chief Minister emotionally. The decision was taken on moral grounds. I spoke to every JDU MLA individually and made them aware of the situation and then they unanimously agreed that it is a brave decision," Nitish said.

He further said, "The Opposition may try to destabilise the government and our workers should brace up for a long fight."

Nitish said the party will analyse the Lok Sabha results. "Caste politics was used extensively during the Lok Sabha elections which was a major factor for JDU's bad performance," he said.

The JDU leader submitted his resignation after the drubbing the party received in Bihar in the general elections. Nitish had sought time to rethink his decision under pressure from party leaders and MLAs. He, however, decided to stick to his decision.
