KUALA LUMPUR: MASkargo Sdn Bhd (MASkargo) has unveiled its special and warm greeting livery on its A330 freighter ahead of the arrival of giant pandas to Malaysia.

MASKargo in a statement here, said the flight bearing registration number 9M-MUD has a new-look design featuring the giant pandas' illustration with 'Malaysia Welcomes FuWa & FengYi' written on it.

MASKargo as the official carrier of the giant pandas has adorned the two year-old A330 freighter to carry the two giant pandas from Chengdu to Kuala Lumpur.

Natural Resources and Environment Minister G. Palanivel earlier Monday had announced that Fu Wa (male) and Feng Yi (female) were scheduled to be sent from China on Tuesday night and would arrive at the MASCargo Complex, KL International Airport (KLIA), Sepang the following day.

The giant pandas are on loan from China in conjunction with the 40th anniversary of diplomatic ties between Malaysia-China this year.

The arrival of the pandas aims to not only further enhance bilateral relations between the two nations but also raise awareness on the importance of wildlife conservation among the public.
