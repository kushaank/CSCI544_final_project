
Claims that untreated veterans have died premature deaths have turned a scandal into a full-blown crisis. In the past 24 hours, Rep. Adam Kinzinger , former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , and former Sen. Bob Kerrey  have added their names to growing list  of politicians calling for Shinseki to step down. Over two weeks ago, both The American Legion and Concerned Veterans for America  called for  Shinseki's resignation.

This is neither Shinseki's first scandal nor the first for the beleaguered VA department. Back in 2003, the former general famously bucked assessments of the troop requirements ahead of the ill-fated invasion of Iraq. History proved him right, but Shinseki didn't last much beyond the criticism leveled at him by administration hawks, retiring just four months after his testimony before Congress.
