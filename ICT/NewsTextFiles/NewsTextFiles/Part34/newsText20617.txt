
MANILA, Philippines - Health authorities are eyeing open defecation as the possible cause of the increase in cholera cases in five barangays in Alamada, North Cotabato this month.

Citing reports of a team of disease and environmental sanitation experts sent by the Department of Health (DOH) to the town of Alamada, DOH spokesman Lyndon Lee Suy said people in the area still practice open defecation and this could have contaminated their water supply.

Lee Suy said an increase in the cases of acute watery diarrhea was recorded starting May 12 in the villages of Dado, Lower Dado, Pigkawaran, Rangayen and Barangiran.

He said although these areas do not have history of cholera, it is possible that an infected person defecated in the open and contaminated the water.

“Actually there were more cases of amoebiasis than cholera.  But why are we working on the premise that it is cholera?  The outcome will be more severe with cholera and when we are working on cholera, it will also cover amoebiasis,” he said.

“We are still validating the real cause of deaths. But chances are they may be associated with cholera rather than amoebiasis as dehydration will be more severe among cholera cases,” Lee Suy said.

The health official refused to say that the increase in cases constituted an outbreak, noting medically, they do not yet warrant the declaration of an outbreak at this point.

The DOH team has been assisting their local counterparts in the diagnosis and management of cases. It distributed oral rehydration solution and supplied the residents with water.

“If residents don’t want to avail of our supplies, they should boil their drinking water. We also encourage them to observe personal hygiene and sanitation, especially hand washing,” Lee Suy said.
