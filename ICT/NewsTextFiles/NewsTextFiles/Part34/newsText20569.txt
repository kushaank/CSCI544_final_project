The Ministry of Agriculture in Lithuania is constantly trying to gather all milk sector members behind the negotiation table and urges all milk producers to cooperate, informs LETA/ELTA.

"Once the factory managed by farmers starts to operate and raw milk demand increases it should boost development of the country's dairy farms", said Minister of Agriculture Vigilijus Jukna. Especially since the Ministry of Agriculture has redistributed rural development funds for 2007-2013, and additionally commissioned LTL 60 million (EUR 17.3 million) to the livestock sector. Meanwhile, this year it will allocate LTL 65.2 million (EUR 19 million).
