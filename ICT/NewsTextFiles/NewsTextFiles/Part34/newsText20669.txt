
ZAMBOANGA CITY (Updated) -- A government prosecutor was killed while on his way home on Monday, an official of the Department of Justice said.

Prosecutor General Claro Arellano said Zaipal Alawi Sr., 64, the Marawi City prosecutor, was shot by still unidentified assailants at 12:05 p.m.

The shooting incident took place at Crossing Sarimanok in the village of Marawi Poblacion, Marawi City, said Army's 1st Infantry Division Public Affairs Officer-in-Charge Captain Franco Suelto.

Wounded in the incident was Alawi's driver, Saiben Durong Baiza, 46.

Arellano urged the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to conduct parallel investigation on the killing, which he said "has no place in a civilized society, regardless of faith and creed."

"We are deeply saddened that he had to be offered as an inspiring sacrifice in the altar of our democratic institution, whose blood will certainly nourish the pillars of the criminal justice system," he said.
