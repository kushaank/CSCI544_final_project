
SDLP health spokesman Fearghal McKinney has called on Health Minister Edwin Poots to "stop scaremongering" after a briefing paper was leaked.

The document contained warnings of potential charges for prescriptions and some medical treatments because of a shortfall in health department funds.

The briefing was prepared by the minister for the health committee.

"Instead of injecting fear into the public, the minister should get on with his job", Mr McKinney said.

He outlined "a catalogue of failures" that he said needed to be dealt with.

"Excessive waiting times and no strategy, hospital deaths that were not reported, a multitude of crises in A&E departments and a TYC plan that is neither measured nor recognisable to the public," he said.

"The health minister needs to stop hiding behind his ministerial colleagues and threats of financial cuts and start running the health service properly."
