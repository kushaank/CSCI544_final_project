
The BNP has renewed its demand for disbanding the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) after media reports said 18 personnel were taken off duty over allegations of embezzlement.

Party’s spokesperson Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir argued  that the force lost its utility.

“Most of the incidents of forced  disappearance and abductions are blamed on the RAB. A state apparatus carrying  out murders for money is unacceptable,” he told a rally in Dhaka on  Monday.

BNP chief Khaleda Zia twice demanded breaking up the elite force  dubbing it a ‘menace’ after several RAB members were accused of abduction and  killing of seven people in Narayanganj last month.

On Monday, DMP News reported withdrawal of 18  officials of RAB’s Crime Prevention Company-3 including its commander Maj Ali  Ahsan.

RAB Director General Mokhlesur Rahman has confirmed their  removal.

BNP leader Fakhrul argued that RAB was formed during his party’s  term in office to combat militancy and terrorism in Bangladesh.

“The  Awami League is using the force for political purposes. RAB is killing people  instead of protecting them,” he alleged.

He took a dig at the ruling  party for refusing to disband RAB.
