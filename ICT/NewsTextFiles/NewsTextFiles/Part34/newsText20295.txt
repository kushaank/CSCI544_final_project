
The head of a Russian engineering group has been detained in ex-Soviet Uzbekistan on suspicion of economic crimes, a Russian embassy official said on Monday.

The president of Western Ural Machine Building Concern (ZUMK) group based in the Urals city of Perm, Aleksandr Pozdeyev, was "detained on suspicion of crimes of an economic nature on May 13," Vadim Chekmazov, a Russian embassy official in Tbilisi, told AFP.

Defence lawyers for Pozdeyev  are appealing against his detention and asking for him to be released on bail, the Russian diplomat said.

Uzbek officials and the prosecutor-general's office could not be reached for comment.

According to local online media reports, Pozdeyev's detention could be linked to alleged overcharging for previously implemented contracts in southern Uzbekistan by ZUMK Engineering, a company within the group headed by Pozdeyev.

The company is implementing projects worth about $180 million in the chemicals industry and coal and mining sectors of Uzbekistan. These include the design and construction of a 33-kilometre-long (20-mile-long) cableway to a potash fertiliser plant.
