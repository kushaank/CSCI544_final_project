
Pakistan High Commissioner to India Abdul Basit says it would be essential to build on past work and take irreversible steps forward.

As India prepared for a change of regime, Pakistan on Monday stressed that the two countries had no option but to talk to each other and normalise relations for their mutual benefit.

A renewed effort to pick up the dialogue process was made by Pakistan’s High Commissioner to India, Abdul Basit, while hosting a delegation of the Press Club of India at the High Commission here. He said it would be essential to build on past work and take irreversible steps forward.

Referring to Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s telephone call to Prime Minister-designate Narendra Modi on Friday, Mr. Basit said Islamabad was committed to a result-oriented dialogue process.
