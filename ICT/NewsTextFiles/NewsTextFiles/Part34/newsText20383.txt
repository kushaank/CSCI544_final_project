Republicans have blocked recovery from the Bush Recession for partisan reasons. Republicans are scum.

"Kudos to Conservative Republican government theory and financial wisdom."

Well it does seem to be working better than the less conservative  neighboring states.

Just an observation based  on the given statistics.

We had the great stimulus that was supposed to solve all of the problems but it turned out to be paybacks to the unions and even the food stamp in chief admitted there were not that many shovel ready jobs.

The Bush Recession was three times worse than anyone knew in 2009, so the Stimulus was too small, and did not last long enough. It did not go for unions and food stamps, that's just Rush Limbaugh talk.

There are plenty of jobs that need doing - much of the nation's infrastructure dates back to the New Deal. There are plenty of willing workers - the 43000 that showed up for 400 Walmart jobs illustrates that. Unemployment is the great moral issue of our time, and the government could do something about it.

This is a demand side recession, and it's not over, despite the stock market. The government can borrow at very low rates, and it could restore taxes on the rich, but Republicans are deliberately sabotaging the economy.
