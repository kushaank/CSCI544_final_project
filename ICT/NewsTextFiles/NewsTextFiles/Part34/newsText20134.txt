
TEHRAN, May 19 (KUNA) -- Iranian President Hassan Rohani on Monday voiced confidence that despite difficulties lying ahead, the nuclear talks with the P5+1 group will culminate in an agreement because both sides share interest in the negotiations.

The aim of the Islamic Republic of Iran is to acquire peaceful nuclear technology; this is a national right, President Rohani told reporters after his meeting with Minister of Roads and Urban Development Abbas Ahmad Akhundi.

Iran seeks to ensure this unalienable right through negotiations which will lead to a mutual understanding and serve the interests of both sides, he pointed out.

Pursuing negotiation doesn't mean that Iran is afraid of danger. This people will resist and defend their right under any conditions, Rohani vowed.

"What concerns the government most is to defend the interests of the people, the revolution and the national security," he stressed.

On his meeting with Akhundi, Rohani voiced hope that the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development will be able to overcome the problems in the civil aviation sector after the country reaches a final agreement with the West.

He highlighted the need of linking the national railroad network to those of neighboring countries, boosting the civil aviation sector and modernizing the air fleet.

President Rohani commended the Iran-P5+1 interim deal reached in November last year, saying it paved the way for taking initial steps for solving the problem.

Under the agreement, Iran agreed to limit certain aspects of its nuclear activities in exchange for some international sanctions relief.
