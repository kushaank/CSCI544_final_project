The Women's Fund of the Athens Foundation presented its first "Woman of the Year" award Friday, May 16, at the Ohio University Inn.

The award, designed to recognize a voice that is making a difference in the lives of women or girls in Athens County, was given to Kerri Shaw, MSW, LISW-S, field education instructor, Department of Social and Public Health at Ohio University. She was recognized for her work in starting Glouster Girl Power for Girls and the Peanut Butter and Jelly Project, as well as additional work in Athens County.

According to a news release, Shaw started the PB & J Project while working at Athens County Children Services. The teachers and principal at Trimble were worried about their students' nutrition over the summer. Shaw organized a meeting of Athens County Job and Family Services, the Athens Food Pantry, and Athens County Children Services.

From this meeting ACCS chose to offer peanut butter and jelly to families with children in Trimble. It expanded to Federal Hocking Local School District, and it's now in all of the school districts in Athens County."

"Kids used to chase my car in the summer asking if I had PB&J in my car," Shaw said in the release. "That speaks to the need in our county."

Shaw served on the board of United Campus Ministry Board, the Birth Circle, Big Brothers Big Sisters Board, and the Habitat for Humanity Family Selection Committee. This summer, Shaw will be working at the Athens Girls Rock Camp. Shaw's dedication and work with vulnerable young women was recognized, the release said.
