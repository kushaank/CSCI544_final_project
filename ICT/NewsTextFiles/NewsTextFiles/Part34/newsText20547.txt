A new offer was made by Pfizer on Sunday, which valued AstraZeneca shares at £55 ($92.48) each. Chairman and Chief Executive Ian Read said in an interview on Sunday with The Wall Street Journal that there was "nothing more" the company could do with regards to an offer. "There is nothing more we are prepared to do," he said. British takeover rules stipulate that Pfizer can't alter the total price of any deal from what was offered Sunday. A dialogue began Thursday between Pfizer and AstraZeneca executives and on Friday Pfizer offered its rival a deal worth £53.50, with that offer discussed over the next two days, the WSJ reported. In a statement on Monday, AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson referred to those discussions, saying that the company's board would only recommend an offer that was more than 10% higher than what was contained in the latest proposal. "The Final Proposal is a minor improvement which continues to fall short of the Board's view of value and has been rejected," he said.
