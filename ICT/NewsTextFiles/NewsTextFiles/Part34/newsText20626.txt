
Pertussis Cases on Rise in California!

Pertussis or commonly referred as whooping cough, has made a comeback in the U.S. a few years back. Since March, there have been 495 confirmed cases of Pertussis registered in California. Though thought to be eradicated, this bacterial infection which starts with a runny nose and cough can turn severe among the infants and elderly adults.

The disease affects the lungs and throat, and people suffer from coughing fits and continuous coughing, which is followed by a gasp for air that makes the whooping sound, which characterizes this disease. Due to the fact that infants below 6 weeks are not administered with vaccines, it is particularly dangerous if they contract this bacterial infection.

Over the years this disease has become highly contagious in California. The health officials have recommended the older adults and young children to be vaccinated, so that the infection is contained, and further spread be prevented. Since last year, hundreds of new cases have been reported in California itself.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has reported 48,000 cases in 2013, the numbers are higher than any previous records. The director of the California Department of Public Health and the state health officer, Dr. Ron Chapman, have expressed his concerns regarding the rise in number of cases and have warned the health officials and citizens to undergoÂ  vaccination.

The health officials have declared that Pertussis vaccines are now available in the Calaveras and San Joaquin county health departments. CDC has passed a law to vaccinate everyone who comes for immunization and specially deliver booster doses to seventh grade students.
