
The development took place when the habeas corpus (produce the body) petition filed by Rajbir Singh came up for resumed hearing before the court headed by justice KC Puri.

When the state government's counsel informed the court that the body of the deceased had been recovered, the court said then the habeas corpus petition became infructuous.

But the petitioner's counsel submitted that the petitioner wanted to move an application seeking a CBI probe into the case in which the deceased was allegedly murdered by the police who were supposed to protect the life and liberty of people. On this, the court adjourned the case to May 28.

Rajbir had moved the high court on May 13 seeking directions to the state police to search for missing Bikramjit and produce him before the court. The court had issued notice of motion to the state government for filing its reply before May 19, which was not filed.

Bikramjit was kidnapped from Guru Nanak Dev hospital, Amritsar, on May 5 and his body was recovered from a canal on May 8. The police had registered an FIR at the Civil Lines police station in Amritsar on May 6 for intentional omission to apprehend on the part of public servant bound to apprehend person under sentence.

The deceased was admitted to the hospital for the treatment of a back problem and the police had claimed that he was picked up by them following information of his involvement in drug smuggling even from the jail premises.

On May 15, Amritsar police commissioner Jatinder Singh Aulakh accepted at a press conference that the police were involved in Bikramjit's kidnapping and murder.
