
The Kogi State Governor, Capt. Idris Wada, has called on aggrieved members of People’s Democratic Party, PDP, to put the past behind and remain united in the interest of the party.

Governor Wada stated this during a stakeholders’ meeting of the People’s Democratic Party, at the glass hall of the Government House Lokoja, the state capital.

The meeting which was at the instance of Governor Wada brought together present and former National Assembly members, a former Deputy Governor in the state, the state PDP Chairman, as well as State Assembly members.

In his opening speech, the State Chairman of the party, Hassan Salau, commended the action taken by the Governor, saying that the state had never had it so good in term of youth empowerment, which according to him has taught the youths “how to fish”.

Speaking on behalf of the East Senatorial District, Christopher Enenche, said that the members of the party in the area were solidly behind the Governor, while General Tunde Ogbeha (Rtd), who spoke on behalf of the West, said that they also remained committed to the party and would continue to support the transformation agenda of Governor Wada.

Similarly, the former Deputy Governor of Kogi State, Patrick Adaba, who spoke on behalf the Central Senatorial District, assured the Governor that they were members of the PDP and would always remain PDP.

The Governor, while thanking them for responding to his call despite the short notice, urged the party members to put aside whatever grievances they may have nursed and unite for the sake of moving the party forward.

According to Capt. Wada, “when you go through turbulent times and come out of it there is need for reconciliation”. He noted that he was not a man of conflict but a man of peace and that he had no apology for initiating peace in the party.
