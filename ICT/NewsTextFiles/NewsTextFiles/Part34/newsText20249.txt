
Doha: Qatar has affirmed its support for the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) and other international human rights mechanisms, stressing that human rights are a strategic choice of the country.

This came during a review of Qatar’s second report to the Working Group on the UPR Mechanism of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva earlier this month.

Sheikh Khalid bin Jassim Al Thani, Director, Human Rights Department, the Foreign Ministry, told a press conference yesterday that there was a broad international welcome to Qatar’s efforts towards promoting and protecting human rights and extending an open invitation to heads of state and hosting UN special rapporteurs. He said Qatar is witnessing a distinctive phase of comprehensive and rapid development as well as high rates of economic growth.

He said Qatar has accepted recommendations on continuing efforts to promote human rights and rejected those on suspending or cancelling the death penalty.

Sheikh Khalid said Qatar’s opening speech delivered by the head of the delegation addressed several important points, including emphasising Qatar’s respect for human rights, the importance of interactive dialogue and full cooperation with UPR Working Group and other regional and international mechanisms related to the promotion and protection of human rights in addition to appreciating the key role played by the group in helping states improve and strengthen their obligations arising from the International Human Rights Law.

The speech also explained consultation which accompanied the preparation of the second national report of Qatar, he said, adding it stressed that the report to the group came as a product of a broad consultative process and as a result of coordination, cooperation and extended partnership with all classes and segments of society and relevant stakeholders.

He explained that the report highlighted the importance and centrality of the promotion and protection of human rights in the comprehensive reform policy pursued by Qatar and the overall vision for development as part of Qatar National Vision 2030.
