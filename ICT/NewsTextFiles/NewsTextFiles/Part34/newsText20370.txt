
A number of Philadelphia city judges will stand trial in the coming weeks after being accused of organizing a ticket-fixing scheme that benefited politically-connected members of the city, an issue that compelled officials to ban traffic court altogether.

After a delay, Monday opening statements in the corruption trial   were scheduled to begin next week. The trial aims to determine   whether six current and former judges are guilty of the 77 counts   they were indicted for.

â€œThe defendants participated in a widespread culture of   giving breaks on traffic citations to friends, family, the   politically connected, and business associates,â€� said a   statement from US attorney Zane Memeger as quoted by CBS .

The accusations first surfaced more than a year ago, with   investigators asserting that six judges and two connected   businessmen conspired to reduce penalties for friends, family,   and other associates. Philadelphia Traffic Court oversees moving   violations, but not parking violations, in the city.

Government prosecutors say that because so many fines were   reduced or altogether tossed out, the judges defrauded the city   and state of Pennsylvania out of an untold amount of funding. The   trial has been pushed back multiple times, with prosecutors   worrying that testimony could be tainted by the years the accused   spent in the court system.

All of the judges have pleaded not guilty, saying that the   preferential treatment amounted to nothing more than requests for   â€œconsideration.â€� Jeffrey M. Miller, a former federal   prosecutor who is representing one of the judges, told the Daily   News that the government may have difficulty proving its case.

Three judges and a court worker who was described as a middleman   for ticket-fixing requests pleaded guilty early this year.

Corrupt scumbags. look at that usual fat face and that stupid looking suit of his. Clinton gets impeached for lying over something that has nothing to do with his job and these scumbags defrauding the city and getting preferential treatment over the regular mortals, and supposedly did nothing wrong.
