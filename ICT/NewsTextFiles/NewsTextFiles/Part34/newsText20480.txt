SAN ANTONIO — State officials have picked up the search for a man who has been missing since he was thrown Sunday afternoon from his motorboat on Braunig Lake.

Capt. Mike Morse of the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department declined to identify the man, but said the department has a SONAR-equipped boat in the water looking for him, and two other game warden boats.

The department has narrowed its search to a grid over a portion of the main body of the lake, Morse said. A Department of Public Safety helicopter scanned the shoreline Monday morning and will return in the afternoon, Morse said.

Initial reports said the boat capsized while the man was boating with a woman about a quarter-mile from shore. But the San Antonio Fire Department later learned the two were actually thrown from the boat, said SAFD spokesman Christian Bove .

“It was a problem with the steering, and so the boat was going in circles, so they were both thrown from the boat,” Bove said.

A kayaker pulled the woman from the water, but the man has been missing since. He was not wearing a life jacket, Bove said.
