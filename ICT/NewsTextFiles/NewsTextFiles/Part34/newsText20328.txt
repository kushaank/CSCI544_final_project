
Ishaq is one of the most senior military officials to be killed in three years of conflict.

Syria’s air defence chief was killed during an offensive by President Bashar Al Assad’s forces against rebels east of Damascus, rebels and a monitoring group said.

They said General Hussein Ishaq died on Sunday from wounds suffered on Saturday during the assault by Assad’s forces on the town of Mleiha which appears to be aimed at expanding the president’s control around the capital before a June 3 election.

The air defence forces which have a large base in Mleiha and are responsible for defending against air attacks, have played little part in the war with rebels who have no air power. However, Ishaq is one of the most senior military officials to be killed in three years of conflict.
