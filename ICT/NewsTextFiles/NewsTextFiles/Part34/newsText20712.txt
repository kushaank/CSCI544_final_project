
Today is the anniversary of the Democrat Party-led government-Army crackdown on red shirt protesters in central Bangkok and elsewhere in the country. Apparently on the orders of Suthep Thaugsuban and Abhisit Vejjajiva, the crackdown left scores of people dead and many more injured. PPT has kept a page that has the remnants of the reporting on the bloody April-May 2010 events . Not that long ago we remembered the April events .

A year ago, we remembered 2010 . That’s an interesting read in the context of events that led to the current anti-democrat demonstrations (which have not seen a military massacre as in 2010). Then we said: “PPT reiterates that those responsible for the murder of civilians must be brought to justice as an important step to rooting out the culture of impunity that state officials and the military has when murdering civilians.” Sadly, what has changed is that those responsible for the massacre are running free, trying to bring down yet another government by extra-legal means.

Law is a fiction in present-day Thailand, with royalists able to do whatever they want, manipulate laws for their gain, throw others in jail, threaten with lese majeste and commit any crime they like.

No law there.

Suthep, who ordered the killing of red shirts, is giving the orders again.

No law there.
