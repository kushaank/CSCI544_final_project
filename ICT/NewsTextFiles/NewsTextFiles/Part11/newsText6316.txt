
Hundreds of protesters on 16 May demonstrated at Kidal airport against the visit of Prime Minister Moussa Mara.

The protesters were likely to be members or sympathisers of the Mouvement National pour la Lib√©ration de l'Azawad (MNLA). They threw stones at forces of the United Nations' peacekeeping mission MINUSMA, who dispersed them with tear gas. At least four civilians were injured. The next day, fighting between MNLA members and Malian armed forces killed eight soldiers and 28 militants, according to the government. The MNLA also occupied the Kidal municipal office, and held 30 municipal workers hostage inside.

In November 2013, former prime minister Oumar Tatm Ly cancelled a visit to the town after protesters blocked Kidal airstrip.
