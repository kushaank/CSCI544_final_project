
Kenya: Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph ole Lenku has expressed concern over the high number of illegal aliens still gaining entry into the country.

Lenku said the immigrants are still getting into the country through Moyale and Mandera and hiding in counties like Isiolo before being ferried to Nairobi.

The CS said one of the major routes used by the aliens is the one that passes through Marsabit, Isiolo, Samburu and Meru counties.

He was speaking in Isiolo town when he met national government administrators and security chiefs from Isiolo, Marsabit, Meru and Samburu.

Principal Secretary Mutea Iringo and Eastern Regional Commissioner Claire Omollo accompanied Lenku in the meeting that was attended bymore than 500 administrators.

“Illegal aliens who enter the country through Moyale and Mandera hide in counties in the region before reaching Nairobi. Some of these foreigners are among those behind the terror attacks we have in Nairobi,” said Lenku.

He expressed surprise that the foreigners were still coming while the region has many police barriers, adding that each county security team must be more vigilant. “Their passage into the country means someone is not sleeping on their job. The issue of aliens must be ended,” he told the administrators who included county commissioners and chiefs.

Lenku told the administrators and security team that the national government will look into their personal welfare well and offer better equipment to enable them work well.

Corruption, he said, was also a contributing factor to insecurity and other social vices like sale of illicit brews which recently claimed about 100 lives in the country.

The minister told the representatives of the national government to use their new power to serve the public well and provide security in their respective counties.
