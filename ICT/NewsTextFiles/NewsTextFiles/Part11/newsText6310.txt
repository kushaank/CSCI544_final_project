
The city police will complete by June 15 the first phase of data collection from hotel entrepreneurs as part of issuing identity cards to migrant workers. The format of the card is ready and the distribution is likely to begin in the first week of July.

Senior officers in charge of the project said most of the hotel entrepreneurs had expressed their willingness to cooperate with the data collection process.

The goal of the department is to prepare a detailed record of all migrant workers recruited by hotels. In the second phase, details of workers employed in the textile and industrial sectors will be collected.

The employers will be responsible for gathering the data and passing it on to the police.

The Special Branch officials will coordinate the project and verify the reliability of the data collected. Cards will be issued after verifying the details through all possible sources. The workers will have to renew the card every year and surrender it to the employer if they leave the State.

“Through the project, we intend to prepare an authentic record of the migrant population in Kozhikode. We will issue the card only after recording their fingerprint,” said P.C. Sajeevan, Assistant Commissioner, Special Branch. The record would help the police track the workers if they were involved in a crime, he said.

The card will bear the name of the hotel, its owner, and the identity details of the worker. The labourers will have to produce the card in case of police inquiry.
