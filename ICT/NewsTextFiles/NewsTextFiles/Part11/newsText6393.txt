LONDON--Libyan authorities are seeking international help in apprehending a former senior official in Moammar Gadhafi's government who has been under investigation for alleged crimes including embezzlement and abuse of office.

Interpol last week published a so-called Red Notice seeking Ali Dabaiba, who ran Libya's main government-contracting office for decades during the Gadhafi era. The notice, posted on Interpol's website, said Mr. Dabaiba is "wanted by the judicial authorities of Libya for prosecution/to serve a sentence."

A lawyer for Mr. Dabaiba had no immediate comment. An Interpol spokeswoman said the notice was published on Thursday at the request of Libyan authorities. Officials in the office of Libya's attorney general weren't available to comment.

The Interpol notice says the allegations against Mr. Dabaiba, 68 years old, include embezzlement, money laundering, abuse of power and other crimes. The notice didn't address whether Mr. Dabaiba has been criminally charged in Libya.

Interpol's Red Notice system is designed to help law-enforcement authorities in one country get assistance from other countries to track down and apprehend suspects. Interpol's website says that the alerts are "to seek the location and arrest of wanted persons with a view to extradition or similar lawful action," and that the notices are issued "on the basis of a valid national arrest warrant."

As Libyan authorities try to recoup tens of billions of dollars in assets they believe were looted during Gadhafi's reign, Mr. Dabaiba's family has been one focus, according to the investigators and documents submitted to British law-enforcement authorities. Mr. Dabaiba is on a long list of individuals whose assets are restricted in Libya pending further investigation.

Unlike some former government officials who are under investigation, Mr. Dabaiba hasn't been subject to restrictions on him leaving the country, according to both Libya's asset-freeze law and the Libyan attorney general's office.

Among the Dabaiba family's investments Libyan investigators have been scrutinizing is a 2011 investment in a posh British real-estate agency, Chesterton Humberts, according to people familiar with the investigation and a person close to the family. That investment was the focus of a recent article in The Wall Street Journal.

Chesterton Humberts said on Twitter this month that the Dabaiba family "are not shareholders" and that the company has "never been approached by Libyan government or any law-enforcement agency." The tweets didn't address whether the Dabaiba family previously invested in Chesterton Humberts.

As recently as April, Mr. Dabaiba was living in the Libyan port city of Misrata, although he regularly left the country, said people who know him.

Libya's audit agency said it found multiple questionable financial decisions at Libya's Organization for Development of Administrative Centers when Mr. Dabaiba was in charge.

Supporters of Mr. Dabaiba say his family's financial support for the 2011 revolution that ultimately overthrew Gadhafi makes up for any alleged misdeeds during his years at ODAC.
