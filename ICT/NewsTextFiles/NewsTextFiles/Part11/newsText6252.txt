
It was feared that there would be more bodies, and the discovery of another grave nearby may reveal more. On Monday a new grave was spotted few metres away from the ones reported on Saturday.

Authorities are yet to establish the identities of the bodies recovered from two mass graves. According to Chief Government pathologist Johansen Oduor, the remains had by the time of discovery decayed extensively that determining their gender and identities require DNA testing. “We have established that the remains found are of adults but we are yet to establish their gender and identities, samples have been taken for analysis so that we can shed more light on the mystery surrounding the bodies,” said Dr Oduor.

He added that the nature of the remains indicated they had been buried for less than three months prompting police to conclude that the killings were recent. Kajiado County Commissioner Laban Kobai pegged the killings to a fierce battle between rival land brokers possibly affiliated to the divided outlawed Mungiki sect.
