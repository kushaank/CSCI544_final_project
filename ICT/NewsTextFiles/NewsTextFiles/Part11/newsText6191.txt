
ONE of the people accused of taking part in the $2.5 million theft of parts from Holden has punched a cameraman in the face outside court and been arrested.

Jason James Gangell, 40, of Pata, south of Loxton, attacked Channel 7 cameraman Andrew Foote without provocation outside the District Court this morning.

Gangell, who has pleaded not guilty to 161 counts of money laundering and one count of theft, was in court to accompany his co-accused, Michelle Carol Rose.

Rose, 37, of Pata, this morning pleaded guilty to nine counts of money laundering and was remanded on continuing bail to face court again next month.

As the duo left court, Mr Foote and several other media cameraman filmed them making their way north along Victoria Square.

Just before the entrance to the Central Market, Gangell grabbed Mr Foote’s camera with his left hand and threw a haymaker-style punch with his right.

The heavy blow connected with the right side of Mr Foote’s face, just below his eye, while a second left-handed swing failed to connect.

Rose continued walking as Gangell was stopped by cameramen and journalists — Channel 7 reporter Graham Hunter restrained Gangell while police were called.

Gangell also raised his fist toward Mr Hunter, and twice tried to strike him with his elbows.

Courts sheriff’s officers took Gangell into custody inside the District Court until SA Police officers arrived.

Gangell was arrested and taken, by cage car, to the Adelaide Police Station where he was charged with one count of committing an assault that caused harm.

He will face court on that charge at a later date.
