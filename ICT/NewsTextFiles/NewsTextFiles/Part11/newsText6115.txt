
A man wanted by South Taranaki police has been arrested in Waikato.

Matthew  Edwards was caught by the armed offenders squad in Otorohanga early  this morning and arrested on outstanding warrants and failing to appear  in court.

Ten days ago Hawera police issued a plea for help to locate Edwards who has been on the run since late last year.

Police want to talk with Edwards in relation to several rural burglaries.

He is due to appear in the Hamilton District Court today.

New Plymouth Sergeant Bruce Irvine said Hawera detectives were driving to Hamilton today to interview Edwards.

Yes - and I got out before my destination.

Yes, but it turned out fine.

No, never a problem.

No, but I'll never travel alone in one.
