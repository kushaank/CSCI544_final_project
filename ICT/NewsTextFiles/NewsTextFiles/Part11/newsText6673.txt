
Citizens in Central Equatoria state are calling upon the ruling party, the SPLM, to urgently embark on service delivery across the country.

The residents of Yei River County say the SPLM should recommit itself to the principles of good governance and basic provision of services to the rural areas as it celebrates the 31st anniversary of its formation.

Some of the citizens who spoke to Eye Radio said the ruling party should live to its values and objectives of creating a prosperous country.

“The SPLM/SPLA has been governing this country for a long time, and the way forward is to have unity of ideas, and we work for the unity of this country and for its development,” said a male resident.

“As a citizen of this country, I say to SPLM that let them work together, let them make peace and deliver service to our people in the rural areas. I need water and primary school and healthcare,” said another concerned citizen.

On Friday, the Sudan People’s Liberation Army and Movement commemorated the 31st anniversary of its establishment in 1983.

The celebrations were marked in most parts of the country under the theme; “Power by ballots not by bullets”.
