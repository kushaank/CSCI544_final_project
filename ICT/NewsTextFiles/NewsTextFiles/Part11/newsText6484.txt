
A Republican lawmaker is raising concerns over the fact that Democrats are planning to host the premiere of an anti-Koch brothers documentary in a taxpayer-funded room in the Capitol on Tuesday.

House Administration Committee Chairwoman Candice Miller, R-Mich., wrote to House Minority Leader Pelosi, D-Calif., to inform her showing the film in a room of the Capitol Visitor’s Center constitutes a political event on congressional property, which is forbidden.

Additionally, Miller notes that Brave New Films, the production company behind the film “Koch Brothers Exposed,” is advertising the screening of the film as its premiere and is promoting the showing on its website, which also violates House rules.

“Our work in this hallowed building must solely be in the interests of the American people and not in the interests of any political cause,” Miller said.

However, a spokesman for Pelosi claimed in a statement that the event is not a premiere or a screening, but rather a press conference where clips from the film will be shown.

“The fact the Chairwoman Miller wrote this letter demonstrates the reach of the Koch Brothers into our government and why there is a need for the public to be more fully informed of their activities, which is the goal of this film,” Drew Hammill said.

Miller suggested in her letter that Pelosi move the event to another location.

“There is no question that there are countless venues in the Washington, DC area, not funded by the taxpayers, which could accommodate this event and remove any controversy,” Miller said.

Reid has launched numerous attacks on the Koch brothers, who are libertarian billionaires who largely made their fortune in the oil business.

Through the Super PAC they helped found, American for Prosperity, the brothers are blanketing key 2014 battleground states with a $30 million ad blitz aimed at Democratic candidates who voted for ObamaCare.
