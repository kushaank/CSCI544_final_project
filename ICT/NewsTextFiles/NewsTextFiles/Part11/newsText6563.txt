
BHUBANESWAR: Senior  Congress leader Narasingh Mishra is emerging as a frontrunner for the post of the leader of opposition in state assembly.

Congress has won 16 seats, retaining its position as the principal opposition party. Mishra, who defeated BJD heavyweight AU Singhdeo in Balangir, is also a  lawyer.

"It is up to the party  MLAs to decide who they want to see as their leader. I will discharge whatever responsibility I am given," the four-time MLA told Times of India on Sunday.

Sources said the Congress legislature party will meet in a day or two to elect a leader.

Known for his debating skills, Mishra served as  deputy to leader of opposition J B Patnaik from 2004 to 2009. He was  law minister in Biju Patnaik's cabinet (1990-1995).

Chiranjib Biswal, who defeated Bishnu Das (BJD) in Jagatsinghpur, is also in the reckoning for the coveted position.
