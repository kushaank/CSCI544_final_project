
Three people will appear in Gisborne District Court over an armed hold-up of a Mexican tourist in Hawkes Bay yesterday.

The 30-year-old hitchhiking tourist lost all his possessions when he was robbed after being picked up on State Highway 2 at the Napier-Taupo Rd turn-off by three men in a ute.

After he was robbed he was left on the side of the highway, police said.

While the man was badly shaken, he was unhurt.

Police were alerted when another motorist picked up the man on the side of the road, about 10 minutes after the robbery.

Police from Wairoa and Gisborne searched two Raupunga properties this morning and arrested three males aged 17, 19 and 22.

They have been charged with aggravated robbery and will appear in Gisborne District Court tomorrow.

Police also found the vehicle used in the robbery as well as some of the tourist's property.

A fourth male aged 22 was also arrested on an unrelated matter.

Sergeant Mike O'Brien said there were still several items belonging to the tourist that had not been found.

"If anyone has any information about these items and knows where they might be, we would like to hear from them. We're also keen to speak to anyone who has information about the robbery and those involved with it,'' Mr O'Brien said.
