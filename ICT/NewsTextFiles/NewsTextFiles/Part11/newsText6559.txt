
In the congressional districts and states where the 2014 elections will actually be decided, likely voters said they would prefer to vote for a Republican over a Democrat by 7 points, 41 percent to 34 percent. A quarter of voters said they were unsure of their preference.

Among these critical voters, Obama’s job approval is a perilous 40 percent, and nearly half say they favor outright repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Sixty percent say they believe the debate over the law is not over, compared with 39 percent who echo the president’s position and say the ACA debate has effectively concluded.

If those numbers weren’t bad enough, the graphic Politico included is just devastating for Democrats. As you can see, Republicans hold a 9-point advantage in competitive House districts and a 7-point lead in Senate races. Republicans need to win a net-six seats this fall to take control of the upper chamber.

Nearly 90 percent of battleground state voters said that Obamacare will be a determining factor in how they vote this fall. Though that figure includes those who support the law, the fact that 60 percent say that the debate isn’t over and 48 percent want full repeal. What’s more, 64 percent said that a divided government is better for the country than single-party control of the White House and Congress.

Democrats are fast-approaching the point of no return. If these numbers hold through the end of the summer, or even stay in this ballpark, the mid-term election could be an absolute disaster for President Obama and congressional Democrats.
