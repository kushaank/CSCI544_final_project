
New Delhi, May 19: It seems that in order to secure his independence, YS Jaganmohan Reddy rushed to Delhi to meet PM designate Narendra Modi on Monday, May 19. According to sources, Jagan's meeting will be a desperate move to get assurance from Modi that N Chandrababu Naidu would not create troubles for him in Seemandhra.

Telugu Desam Party (TDP) supremo Naidu is all set to become the first Chief Minister of Seemandhra. His party, in an alliance with BJP , won 16 seats and Jagan's party YSR Congress won 9 seats in the state.

Recently, TDP in its official Facebook page , hinted that it may take serious actions against those ministers and party leaders who have been facing serious corruption charges against them if the party comes to power. Now, Jagan might be sent to jail once again as he has been accused of doing misdeed in several corruption cases in Andhra Pradesh. He was granted bail just ahead of the recently concluded Lok Sabha election and assembly elections in both Seemandhra and Telangana.

Now, when Jagan has been scheduled to meet Modi, experts claim that he would definitely demand for his independence by giving outside support to NDA, an offer which is not required for BJP to form government at the centre on its own.

Jagan did not leave a single stone unturned while admitting to Modi-wave. He said, "We saw the Narendra Modi wave and it had to be countered. We took a few decisions. A few misfired."

However, when he was asked if it he is worried about Chandrababu Naidu at the helm in Seemandhra, he said, "It does not make any difference. Sonia Gandhi did whatever she could do. Now, it's going to start again with Chandrababu Naidu. I believe in God. I believe in destiny."
