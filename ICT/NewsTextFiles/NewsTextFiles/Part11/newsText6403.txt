
The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland will tomorrow (20 May 2014) debate the question of Scottish independence.

More than 800 commissioners from the Church "will have the opportunity to contribute their views on one of the most historically significant moments in Scottish history," the Kirk said in a news release.

The Queen sent a message to the General Assembly, which mets from 17-22 May this year, and is the Kirk's major decision-making body, in which she stated: â€œIn this important year of referendum, we pray that whatever the outcome, people of faith and people of good will, will work together for the social good of Scotland.

The Church of Scotland is committed to what it describes as a position of neutrality on the referendum, but recognises that its commissioners and members have much to contribute to the substance of the discussion.

Chaired by the new Moderator, the Rt Rev John Chalmers, the General Assembly will hear from four speakers before the session is opened for contributions on Tuesday afternoon.

Author and lecturer the Rev Dr Doug Gay of Glasgow University will speak for the Yes perspective.

Douglas Alexander MP will propose his views on why Scotland should refuse to be fully self-governing.

Former Moderator of the General Assembly, Alison Elliot, will pose some of the questions facing undecided voters.

John Sturrock QC will reflect on the debate at the end and highlight some of the most helpful and profound contributions.

There will be no vote at the end of the debate.
