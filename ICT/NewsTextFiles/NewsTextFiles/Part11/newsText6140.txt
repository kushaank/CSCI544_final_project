West Virginia’s network of regional jails is looking for input from the communities they serve on its public safety role as well as the resulting costs.

The Regional Jail and Correctional Facility Authority is meeting with local and county officials at each of its 10 facilities over the next several months, as part of its cost containment review process.

Such meetings have traditionally been limited to Charleston. Authority Executive Director Joe DeLong believes that holding them in communities across the state will yield several benefits.

Each meeting will begin at 11 a.m. with a presentation that outlines the agency’s finances jail operations. That will set the stage for a roundtable discussion of ways to control costs and improve services. Participants can also tour the jail afterwards.

West Virginia’s Association of Counties, County Commissioners’ Association and Municipal League have taken part in these discussions previously along with the state Supreme Court, and have helped promote the ongoing series of regional meetings.

The first meeting, held Thursday, May 15 at the Southwestern Regional Jail in Logan, drew a number of local magistrate and circuit court officials, DeLong said, among other government representatives.

“I think it was very productive. It was a very good discussion,” DeLong said.
