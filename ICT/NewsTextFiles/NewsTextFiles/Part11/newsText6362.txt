
The Lebanon school board Monday night gave Superintendent Marianne Bartley the authority to apply for a School Climate Transformation Grant from the U.S. Department of Education.

Whether she'll choose to pursue it is another question.

The five-year grant would be for the implementation of programs that address students' social, emotional, and mental health needs in an effort to improve behavioral and academic outcomes.

The grant program is part of  President Barack Obama's Successful, Safe and Healthy Students program. A $280 million initiative designed to reduce violence in schools and its impact on students, according to the U.S. Department of Education's website.

"Basically it works on anything with school climate," Bartley told the board. "It could be positive behavior supports. It could be all the resiliency types of things that we have done. It could be on mental health issues."

The School Climate Transformation program will award about $24 million in grants. The maximum grant will be $750,000 per year up to five years. However, the average grant is expected to be $200,000, according to the U.S. Department of Education's website.

Although Bartley received permission to apply for the grant, she told the board she is not yet certain she will do so. The grant application is complicated, and she and her staff do not have the time to devote to writing it, so outside help will be needed to complete it by the June 23 deadline, she explained.

The grant writing help would cost no more than $4,000 and is available in her office's budget, Bartley said.

"It is a long shot," she said. "It is very difficult and very competitive. But our resources our tight and we need to try, where we can, to get what we can get."

The board also received an update from guidance counselor Karl Liedtka on the district's new school-to-career graduation policy. The policy takes effect with students graduating in 2018, and will begin next year when they enter ninth grade.

Counselors, working closely with teachers and parents, will help students identify career paths and develop the job-acquisition skills necessary to transition from high school to post-secondary school education  and then to  the working world, Liedtka said .

The policy was adopted a year ago and requires that students complete an internship or some other career-based experience in order to graduate. That requirement will replace the current senior project obligation.
