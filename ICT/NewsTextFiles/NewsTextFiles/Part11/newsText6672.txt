
The Kenya government will offer one thousand scholarships to South Sudanese students this year, an official has said.

The scholarship will be for students majoring in science subjects.

The Deputy Minister of Education, Bol Makueng, told Eye Radio that the scholarship will include students studying communication.

“Those scholarships will be in the areas of technology -especially Agronomists or Agricultural Engineering and architecture,” he explained.

“This is to help us have people who know technology to use our resources and implement what they learned and we have asked for 1,000 scholarships.

Mr Makueng said 500 students will have full scholarship and the others will get ‘partial scholarship’.

“We will announce the scholarships on TV, Radios and Newspapers for people to apply for it,” he added.

The deputy minister said they have formed a technical committee with the Kenyan government to come up with procedures for enrolling students for the scholarship program in Kenya by September.

He said the students will be admitted at the Catholic University of Kenya, Kenyatta University, the African Institute for Science and Technology and the Kenyan college of Accounting.
