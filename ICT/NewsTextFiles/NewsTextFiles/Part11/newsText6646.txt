
 Damascus : The head of Syria’s air defences was killed in clashes near the capital, Damascus. A government official and activists said on Sunday, one of a few high-ranking military officers to be killed in the country’s 3-year-old civil war, according to a report by AP.

 Lt Gen Hussein Ishaq died on Saturday as rebels attacked a Syrian air defence base near the town of Mleiha, the official said.

He spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorised to brief journalists about Ishaq’s death.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also confirmed Ishaq’s death.

It said he died from wounds he suffered during Saturday’s fighting. The Observatory, which bases its reports on a network of activists on the ground, said Ishaq was killed in clashes with fighters from the Nusra Front, the al-Qaida affiliate in Syria, and other Islamic rebel groups.

Heavy fighting has happened around Mleiha in recent weeks. Forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad have conducted a heavy bombing campaign around the area, which rebels see as strategically important due to its proximity to the capital.

Ishaq is one of a few high-ranking military officers to be killed in the Syrian war. It’s unclear if his death will have any wider strategic or military impact on the war itself, however.
