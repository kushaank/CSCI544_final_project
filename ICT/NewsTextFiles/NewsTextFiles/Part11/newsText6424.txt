The Etowah County Commission will meet at 5 p.m. Tuesday in the commission chambers at the Etowah County Courthouse.

The meetings are scheduled for 10 a.m. on the first and third Tuesdays, but commissioners wanted to have the meeting at 5 p.m. on the third Tuesdays in May and June to give more residents an opportunity to attend if they wish.
