
Clinton Dale Funch-Fletcher pleaded guilty to the offence in the Rockhampton Magistrates Court yesterday.

Police prosecutor Constable Manon Barwick said police observed Funch-Fletcher on the roof of the Zodiac Nightclub on William St about 3am on April 20.

Const Barwick said the building was about four metres high.

"If he was to fall he would have been at high risk of injury," she said.

The court heard police officers entered the club and spoke with staff members, who were unaware a man was on the roof.

They gained entry to the roof top, which is not accessible to the public, and removed Funch-Fletcher.

Const Barwick said he climbed the drainpipe after he was refused entry to the club.

She said his girlfriend was inside and he wanted to see her.

Funch-Fletcher was fined $300.
