
The uptake of digital technology in Jersey will be under examination today (Monday).

A digital skills scrutiny panel will quiz the Economic Minister on issues such as the use of ICT in schools.

It's the penultimate hearing. Senator Alan MacLean will be asked about how he plans to address any gaps in IT skills amongst islanders. It follows concern that many people won't be able to access the number of government services online.

The overall review has been looking at the Â£40 million invested in the Gigabit Jersey service, which is designed to increase the speed and efficiency of broadband in the island.

There has also been significant investment in Digital Jersey, a group set up to expand government services online and support IT companies.
