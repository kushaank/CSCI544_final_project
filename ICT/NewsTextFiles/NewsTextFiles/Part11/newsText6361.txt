
When it was chartered on Dec. 1, 1942, the Jonestown Lions Club created the mission statement, "We Serve."

More than 70 years later, the club continues to serve the community with various projects. One of the biggest projects is its support of the Jonestown Outreach Pantry, or JOY, a food pantry that serves northern Lebanon County. JOY relies on the financial support of local churches, organizations and businesses. Recently, the Jonestown Lions Club donated $1,000 to JOY.

The club uses fundraisers to support community projects, including an annual October pancake breakfast, and a chicken barbecue and sub sale in the spring and fall.

The club credits the generosity of the community for raising funds for its annual sight drive. The sight drive provides goods and services for residents with vision problems. Services include eye exams, eyeglasses, audio books, medications and transportation. All donations to the sight drive are used for visually-impaired residents of northern Lebanon County.

The Jonestown Lions Club meets at the Farmer's Wife Restaurant on the second and fourth Thursday of the month from September to June. New members are always welcomed.
