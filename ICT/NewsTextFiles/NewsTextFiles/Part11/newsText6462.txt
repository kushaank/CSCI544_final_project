
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton wants Congress to know that it wouldn't be wise to interfere in local District of Columbia affairs during the budget process.

Norton, a Democrat who represents the District in Congress, will speak a news conference Monday with representatives of national groups. The event is meant to inform members of Congress that the District has allies that will fight efforts to undo local laws on gun control, marijuana and other subjects.

Congressional Republicans have frequently used the budget process to influence social policy in the heavily Democratic district, most often by barring the use of local tax dollars to fund abortion.

Norton will be joined by representatives of abortion-rights groups, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, among others.
