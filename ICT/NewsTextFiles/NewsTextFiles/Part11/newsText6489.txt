
The biggest party in town May 30-31 will be at Veterans Park during the Fremont Community Foundation's seventh annual Holy Smoke BBQ & Showdown.

The Cañon City Council approved an application for a Special Events Liquor Permit for the event during its regular meeting Monday.

Dan Brown, board president  of the FCF, said representatives from the Food Channel are considering attending and covering the event for a new show. The event includes competitive barbecue teams, live music and vendors both days. The committee expects to have 38 competitors this year, compared to the usual 30-36.

"We have johnny Trigg coming who is a two-time world champion," Brown said. "He has quite a following, so other competitive teams will follow him in."

Brown said the event typically costs about $45,000 to put on, mostly for rentals, but by moving from its previous location near the Abbey to Veterans Park, the committee will save at least $6,000 upfront. Admission will be $5 for adults, and children 12 and under will be admitted free of charge. The event will run from 3 p.m. May 30 to 11 p.m. May 31.

"We are excited to be right next to the train and right next to the river," Brown.

Since 1999, and known formerly as the Belvedere Community Foundation, FCF has raised about $180,000 and given it back to local community nonprofit groups.

In 2013, the FCF awarded $19,967 to  18 local organizations, including Penrose Senior Center, VFW-Penrose, Cañon City Pregnancy Center, Cañon City High School Senior Fun Fest, Colorado Mounted Rangers and Fremont County Search & Rescue.

The FCF also will take part in hosting the  Royal Gorge Whitewater Festival June 20- 21 and the John Wells Memorial Bike and Poker Run on Sept. 7. For more information, visit fremontcommunityfoundation.org .
