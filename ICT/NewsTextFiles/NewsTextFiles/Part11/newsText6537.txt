
Assembly Minority Leader Jon Bramnick, center, along with fellow Republican Assemblymen David Rible and Declan O'Scanlon, call for the legislative probe into the George Washington Bridge lane closures to be put on hold.

Assembly Republicans on Monday said the legislative panel investigating the George Washington Bridge lane closures should put its inquiry on hold until the U.S. Attorney completes his own investigation.

Instead, said Assembly Republican Leader Jon Bramnick, lawmakers should focus on Port Authority reforms and — unrelated to the bridge scandal — job creation.

“I would hope that legislators begin to legislate and not simply investigate,” said Bramnick, R-Union, at a State House news conference on Monday.

It was not the first time that Republicans called for a suspension of the investigation that has embroiled the Christie administration. In particular, Republican Assemblywoman Amy Handlin, who is a member of the bridge committee, presses at every opportunity for the committee to turn its attention to reform bills that she introduced earlier this year .

Tom Hester, a spokesman for Assembly Democrats, said GOP lawmakers are only trying to help the Republican governor get out of a politically difficult situation.

The committee will meet again tomorrow to hear testimony from Matt Mowers, who worked in the governor’s Office of Intergovernmental Affairs before leaving last April to join Christie’s re-election campaign. Mowers’ testimony comes after the panel heard from Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak and from Christina Renna , who worked in the intergovernmental affairs office.

Bramnick criticized Democrats for paying too little attention to the state’s fiscal and unemployment problems.
