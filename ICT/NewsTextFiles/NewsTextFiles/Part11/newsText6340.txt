
BAMAKO, May 19 (Xinhua) -- 30 administrators working in the governor's office in Mali's northern town of Kidal were arrested and held hostage on Saturday by fighters of the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), a source within the governor's office said.

The same source said some of the arrested workers could have been hurt.

"The arrests occurred during a clash between the governmental army and MNLA who were opposed to the arrival of Prime Minister Moussa Mara in Kidal," the source explained.

The Malian prime minister who was making his first trip to the north since being appointed, was besieged by MNLA members after meeting with Malian government workers.

"At the time when they were attacking the governor's office, the Malian soldiers as well as the UN and French Serval forces were not there since they were protecting the prime minister at the MINUSMA base in Kidal," the administrative source said.

A statement released later by Mali's defense ministry said 36 people had died from an exchange of fire between the army and MNLA fighters, with eight of them being Malian soldiers.

The prime minister said on Sunday that he had left Kidal earlier on the day.
