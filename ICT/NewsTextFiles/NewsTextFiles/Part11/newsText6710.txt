
The Guardian has hired New York Times' Associate Managing Editor for Digital Strategy Aron Pilhofer, placing him in the newly-created role of executive editor of digital, incoming editor-in-chief of TheGuardian.com Janine Gibson announced on Monday.

The move comes less than two months after a blistering internal " innovation" report   warned that the Times' "journalism advantage is shrinking" as it is surpassed by new digital competitors. It's also a particularly interesting hire as Gibson had been in talks with Jill Abramson, former executive editor of the Times, to join as co-managing editor in order to boost digital strategy at the paper. It was that move that led Times publisher  Arthur Sulzberger to fire Abramson  after concluding that she had misled both him and chief executive Mark Thompson during her effort to hire Gibson.

"When we began talking in March, it was immediately apparent that Aron would bring the right combination of passion, ambition and skill to the Guardian," Gibson said in a statement. "He is a terrifically talented and visionary editor who clearly understands the future of digital journalism and we're delighted he is joining our team."

Pilhofer, who is also editor of interactive news at the Times, will "develop and execute new and innovative digital journalism initiatives and tools to help grow global audiences and deepen reader engagement," according to a news release. He will start in the U.S. newsroom and move to London over the summer.

“If he hires the right deputy maybe it will work. But the signals he is sending are so much business as usual it’s very hard for me to imagine he’s capable of leading that type of change,"  a former staffer said last week.
