
Kenya: ODM leader Raila Odinga has backed embattled Nairobi Governor even as the former Prime Minister’s allies warn of Evans Kidero’s political downfall.

Raila, who has had somewhat chilled relations with the governor in the recent past, has criticised Court of Appeal’s Tuesday verdict, which nullified Kidero’s election.

Â “Team CORD unreservedly believes that the governor was validly elected on an ODM ticket, and as such take the greatest exception to the Court of Appeal ruling against Kidero’s election as governor of Nairobi. It is hoped that quick recourse sought from the highest court on the land will do justice and reinstate Kidero to serve the remainder of his term in office,” Raila, who is on a US tour, says in an email to The Standard on Saturday.

When Raila reaction was bounced off, his close allies were categorical that he was just being civil.

Contacted, Homa Bay Senator Otieno Kajwan’g, pointed out that the party was not happy with Kidero’s open support to non- ODM candidates after the court annulled the election of Migori Governor Okoth Obado (PDP) and ousted ODM ’s Nyando MP Fred Outa. He supported Outa’s challenger Fred Okello of Ford Kenya and Obado in the event of a by-election.

“When Kidero (pictured) announced he would support Obado and Okello, if there is a by-election, he was going against the party. He broke the law and therefore we cannot support him if he loses his seat,” Kajwang says.

Kajwang used the analogy of Babylon in the Bible to sum up the ODM ’s disenchantment with the governor.

The Supreme Court has set aside the verdict of the lower court pending determination of the petition lodged by Kidero.

The merits and demerits of the petition aside, tension has been simmering in ODM strongholds.
