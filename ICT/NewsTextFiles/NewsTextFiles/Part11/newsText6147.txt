
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - The push for Utah to take control of millions of acres of federal public lands in the state has become a full-time campaign for one state lawmaker.

Ivory has mostly closed from his law practice and now earns his salary from a nonprofit that advocates for the cause.

Some political observers say Ivory's activities could constitute lobbying in other states.

Ivory tells the Salt Lake Tribune that he's not a lobbyist but he advocates for a general principle rather than specific legislation in other states.
