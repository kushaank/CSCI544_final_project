
Approximately 1.2 million Kraft cottage cheese containers could go bad and sicken consumers before the marked expiration date.

The food manufacturer therefore issued a voluntary recall, Saturday, according to United Press International.

The affected products include Knudsen Cottage Cheese, Breakstone's Cottage Cheese, Simply Kraft Cottage Cheese and Daily Chef Cottage Cheese, with sell-by date codes ranging from May 9 to July 23, 2014.

The Simply Kraft cups bear the plant code 06-245, and case code 21 JUL 2014 . Containers with codes 36-2158 and W 21 JUL 2014 are not part of the recall.

Company officials said the cottage cheese was not kept in proper conditions.

"Some ingredients used in these products were not stored in accordance with Kraft's temperature standards," the company said in a release. "While unlikely, this could create conditions that could lead to premature spoilage and/or food borne illness; therefore, the company is issuing the recall as a precaution."

Kraft's Tulare, Calif., manufacturing plant is no longer making or shipping the product out so the issue can be corrected, the press release reported.

Consumers with affected cups can receive a full refund or exchange the items at the store where the product was first purchased.

The company recalled other cheese products in October and January.

Employees voluntarily pulled back 735,000 cases of Polly-O String Cheese Products in October, for fear they would go bad before their "Best When Used By" date, according to a press release at the time.

3.3 pound cases with six, nine-ounce microwavable containers of Kraft Velveeta Cheesy Skillets Singles were also brought back in January, FSIS recall information previously said.

The Kraft Foods Consumer Relations line is available for inquiries at 1-800-396-6207 from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. eastern standard time.
