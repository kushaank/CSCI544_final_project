
WASHINGTON â Republicans have entrusted a seven-member investigative team with âgetting to the truth,â in the words of House Speaker John Boehner, about whether the Obama administration misled Americans about the deadly attacks in Benghazi, Libya.

They insist the investigation is not political.

Several GOP members of the House Select Committee on Benghazi have made claims about administration wrongdoing. Some have participated in previous investigations into how the ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, and three other Americans were killed on Sept. 11, 2012, and how the administration responded.

Democrats have yet to say whether they'll participate in what will be the eighth investigation since the attack on the American diplomatic outpost in the eastern Libyan city.

Republicans say they need to find out why security was insufficient, what the president did on the night of the attack, why the U.S. military did not intervene, why initial explanations focused on a protest over a YouTube video and whether the administration deliberately sought to hide evidence about its conduct.

The second-term Tea Partier and former prosecutor from South Carolina said two weeks ago that there is evidence of a âcover-up.â He cited a recently released email by White House national security communications aide Ben Rhodes.

He said the email âprobably was the straw that broke the camel's back, because that memo made it really clear, we're going to blame an Internet video and not a broader policy failure in Libya.â The White House has said Rhodes was referring to attacks across the Muslim world, not Benghazi specifically.

The 37-year-old Alabama congresswoman, attorney and daughter of a federal judge led the House Armed Services Committee's investigation. That panel rejected claims by conservatives that the military failed to respond on the night of the attacks â putting her at odds with other Republicans.

Her investigative panel concluded in a report in February that there was no âstand downâ order issued to military personnel in Tripoli, the Libyan capital, who wanted to aid Americans in Benghazi. Select committee colleagues Gowdy and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, have suggested otherwise.

Westmoreland pointed to a department cable declining security requests âsignedâ by Clinton. The conclusion has been widely challenged: the secretary of State's name is routinely attached to State Department correspondence from Washington, most of which he or she never sees or is consulted on. Lower-level department officials have said they were responsible for specific security decisions related to Benghazi.

In recent days, Democrats have targeted Westmoreland for âpoliticizingâ Benghazi because he serves as deputy chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, which has begun an election-year fundraising drive linked to the attacks.

The hard-charging conservative and occasional GOP leadership thorn has repeatedly pressed witnesses on Benghazi as a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

Jordan has accused Clinton personally of trying to obstruct Congress' investigation of Benghazi when a top aide asked for a department lawyer to be present when members of Congress spoke with American diplomats in Tripoli after the attacks.

According to The Columbus Dispatch, the Ohio Republican said at a Heritage Foundation event this month that the State Department rejected more than 200 requests for additional security. And when the attacks happened, he said, there was little effort to fight back.

The 50-year-old Kansas congressman has focused on the talking points. In May 2013, he said, the State Department and White House produced a document that âdidn't reflect the reality on the ground as they knew it at the time.â He accused âpoliticalâ actors of withholding intelligence from the public.

âWere we misled?â Pompeo asked Morell at the hearing. âNo,â Morell responded. âI have a different view,â Pompeo shot back.
