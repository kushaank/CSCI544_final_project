A renegade general with links to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and a mission to save Libya has been accused of staging a coup.

Forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar have carried out attacks on militias in Benghazi, and stormed the parliament building in the capital Tripoli. Haftar says he wants to rid the country of what he called “extremist groups’ and a “terrorist scourge”.

He said: "In the military when we launch a battle, it is followed by reorganising our troops, then we return with strength. It is impossible for us to go back on this matter. We will never retreat until we reach our goals."

Haftar was once an ally of former leader Muammar Gaddafi but turned against him and supported the revolution. He now heads his self-declared Libyan National Army.
