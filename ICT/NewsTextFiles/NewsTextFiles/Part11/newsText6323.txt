
Ambyth Shipping scare a false alarm - KUAM.com-KUAM News: On Air. Online. On Demand.

As Guam Police Department spokesperson Officer AJ Balajadia confirms, the individual was simply returning items to his former employer.

"It turns out a former employee of Ambyth Shipping needed to return some items that did not belong to that employee. And instead of bringing them into the office and not wanting to deal with his former supervisor, left them in a box outside of the business," he said.

As we reported on Friday, the suspicious package prompted an evacuation and road closure. ETF, EOD, and FBI were notified and a K-9 Unit was also called in to sweep the site.

The all-clear was given later that afternoon.
