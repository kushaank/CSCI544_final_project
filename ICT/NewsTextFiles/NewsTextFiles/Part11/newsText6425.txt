
David Leyonhjelm tweets criticism of 'gay lifestyle'

Leyonhjelm, a member of the libertarian Liberal Democratic party, secured 8.9% of the vote in New South Wales in September’s federal election after he drew first place on the ballot paper, prompting allegations that many Liberal supporters had voted for him by mistake.

The Liberal Democrat party president, Gabriel Buckley, confirmed to Guardian Australia that Leyonhjelm had written the tweet.

“I think that freedom of speech is vital for a functioning democracy and freedom of speech should entail the freedom to say things that other people might find controversial,” he said.

Buckley argued the tweet did not equate a “gay lifestyle” with “reckless promiscuity”.

“They certainly appeared to be two separate questions to me – judging by the use of capital letters and punctuation marks,” he said.

Is approval of gay lifestyle necessary to support gay rights? Is reckless promiscuity a right? Tolerance doesn't require approval.

Leyonhjelm did not respond to a request for comment. The senator-elect had previously defended his decision to question a job applicant about his sexuality. “Fuck that. I will ask whoever I want if they are gay,’’ he told Sydney’s Daily Telegraph.

Leyonhjelm is due to take his seat in the Senate in July.
