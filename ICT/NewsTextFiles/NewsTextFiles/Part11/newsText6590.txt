
A car is seen stranded in the flooded town of Obrenovac, southwest of Belgrade.

Landslides complicated rescue efforts in Serbia Monday after the worst recorded flooding in the Balkans had caused dozens of casualties and forced thousands from their homes.

Water levels in the Sava River have receded in Obrenovac, the hardest-hit Serbian town so far, and Sabac, revealing bodies of victims and causing landslides that destroyed houses.

The official death toll reached 17 in Serbia on Monday morning, including 12 in Obrenovac where most of the town was submerged when the Sava River, a tributary of the Danube, burst its banks.

Smaller towns along the Sava and Mlava remain under threat of flooding. The Serbian capital of Belgrade has been secured with sandbags and the peak wave is expected there by the middle of the week.

Thousands fled their homes in Serbia and neighboring Bosnia due to the flooding caused by heavy rainfall.
