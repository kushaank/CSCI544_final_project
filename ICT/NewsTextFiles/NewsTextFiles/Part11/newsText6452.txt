
COIMBATORE: Trouble is brewing in the Congress party following the drubbing it received in the just concluded general elections with former state president and Pollachi candidate K Selvaraj seeking the removal of the current state president B S Gnanadesikan.

"The party president failed to even call candidates to touch base on the ground realities. There is no clarity about the funds he received from the headquarters for election spending in the state. We are planning to meet Soniaji and Rahulji by the end of this week and will seek the removal of Gnanadesikan. We will also request the central leadership to get back the funds meant for election spending," said Selvaraj who is the state president of Congress Seva Dal.

He also alleged that one of the leaders from Coimbatore district received money from the DMK and worked against the Congress in Pollachi parliamentary constituency in the general elections. "This person who received money from DMK secured several lakhs of votes in the assembly election. But this time he worked against the Congress," he alleged.

He said that he has already lodged a complaint against the leader with AK Antony who is the member of disciplinary committee. "Rahulji would take stern action against the leader for working against the Congress," said Selvaraj.

He also alleged that Gnanadesikan failed to interact with senior leaders GK Vasan and P Chidambaram before the general elections. He failed to campaign for the party candidates. "Congress candidate from all the constituencies in the state would conduct a meeting in Chennai within the next two days to discuss the issue," said Selvaraj.

He also added that they would conduct a protest if the party failed to remove Gnanadesikan from the post of state president of the party.
