
Meet Leann Wilson, owner of Madam & Steve Bakery , the first and only erotic bakery in the state of Utah. Operating out of her home in Sugar House, Wilson specializes in all kinds of sex-related baked goods like butt cakes, boob cakes, intercourse cakes and, of course, the classic dick cake. Basically, she can whip-up whatever your sick and twisted imagination can muster.

So, to learn what it takes to create these masterpieces, we asked Leann to give us the rundown on the most basic of erotic cakes, the dick cake. Think of this as an episode of Reading Rainbow, except instead of have Levar Burton showing you how trash is recycled or whatever--we'll show how you to shape a cake into a penis. Take a look, it's in a book, we're making a dick cake... WE'RE MAKING A DIIIICK CAAAAKE!

Warning: You probably shouldn't watch this video at work, unless your place of business is cool with cakes that look like giant, triumphant one-eyed monsters.
