
A pair of receptions to introduce Midwest Energy customers to the proposed solar energy farm, to be located near Colby, are planned for Tuesday and Wednesday in Hays and Colby.

The Hays reception will be from 5:30 to 8:30 p.m. at Gella's Diner, 117 E. 11th. The event is a come-and-go reception, with representatives of Clean Energy Collective available to discuss the program on an individual basis.

A second meeting is planned from 7:30 to 10 a.m. Wednesday at the City Limits Convention Center in Colby. It will follow a similar schedule as the Hays event.

Midwest Energy and CEC are working together to build a solar farm. Midwest Energy customers will be able to buy individual panels, and will receive credit for the energy produced.
