
A FORMER Gold Coast prosecutor - who described her actions as a "brain-snap" in a voicemail message - is fighting claims she reopened her boyfriend's assault court case to reduce his penalty.

Crown prosecutor Phil McCarthy told the jury Ms Doolan was so angry about the fine and compensation order served to Roep in the Southport courts that she allegedly lied to the magistrate.

He said the magistrate subsequently reduced the compensation Roep had to pay.

Mr McCarthy said Ms Doolan emailed her boyfriend's lawyer with information that Mr Roep's assault victim was named in a domestic violence application.

She allegedly got that information through accessing internal police logs.

The trial continues.
