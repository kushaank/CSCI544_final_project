
Spanish airline Iberia has won a second contract from Airbus Defence and Space to convert three new A330 airliners into MultiRole Tanker Transports (MRTT).

An Airbus spokesman told IHS Jane's on 19 May there were no concrete customers yet for the aircraft but they wanted to "have excess capacity" to be in a position to quickly meet "contracts that are in the making".

Among countries on the potential export client list are Singapore and India, as well an imminently expected domestic order by France.

The start of work on transforming the tankers would depend on the progression of these orders, but the programme "will probably start next year", he added.

Iberia, which previously won a contract from Airbus to convert three A330s to MRTTs for the Royal Saudi Air Force, said each plane would represent around a year's work for its engineering and maintenance teams.

It would include completely dismantling the plane's cabin and the installation of a hose and funnel system on the wings, a flying boom and a mid-flight refuelling system, along with a fly-by-wire flight control device.
