
Kericho, Kenya: Kericho County residents have started collecting signatures to petition the Senate to reinstate impeached area governor Paul Chepkwony.

He added that they target to marshal over 100,000 residents from across the county to sign the petition to be presented to the Senate committee that would be constituted to investigate allegations levelled against Chepkwony by the local County Assembly.

“As voters who elected Governor Chepkwony in the last election, we believe the governor was impeached on flimsy grounds and that is why as residents we want the Senate to reinstate him,” said Soi.

He also commended 15 of the 47 Members of the Kericho county Assembly (MCAs), who broke ranks with their colleagues and absconded the debate that saw Chepkwony impeached on Wednesday.

The Motion was tabled by Albert Kipkoech (nominated).

“We commend the 15 MCAs for heeding the advice of Kipsigis council of elders and church leaders to spare our governor the impeachment ,” said Soi.

The group spoke as Bureti Watchdog Forum Chairman Geoffrey Rono supported Chepkwony impeachment and urged the Senate to send him packing should it prove any of the accusations against him.

“We elected the MCAs to represent us at the assembly and to play an oversight role over the executive. Therefore, if the assembly found reasonable grounds to impeach governor Chepkwony, then we urge the Senate to investigate the allegations and if they are valid send him packing,” said Rono.

Meanwhile, an MP in the North Rift has differed with the Jubilee government following the redeployment of the Director of the National Youth Service Kiplimo Rugut.
