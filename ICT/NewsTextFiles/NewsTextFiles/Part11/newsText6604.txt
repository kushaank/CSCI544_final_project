
Climate change could turn sea turtles entirely female, a new study says.

Populations of sea turtles may temporarily increase as a warming climate triggers the birth of female hatchlings, according to a new study to be published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change. But, it warns, there comes a point with rising temperatures when no males at all will be born, spelling doom for the species.

Scientists have long known that the reproductive process in reptiles is extremely sensitive to shifts in temperature, which affect the ratio of male to female offspring. For species of sea turtles, once the temperature goes above about 84 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius), more girl turtles are born. At about 87 degrees Fahrenheit (30.5 degrees Celsius), populations become completely female.
