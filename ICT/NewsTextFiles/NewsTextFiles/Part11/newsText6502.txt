
New Delhi: The Uttarakhand government seems to be in trouble. Chief Minister Harish Rawat on Monday sacked state tourism minister Amrita Rawat.

Amrita Rawat is Satpal Maharaj's wife and had defected to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) just before the elections.

The move seems to stem out of the recent drubbing the Congress received at the hands of the BJP in the general elections. The Congress failed to open its account in the state with five seats, all of which went to the BJP.
