“I talked to Kılıçdaroğlu on Thursday regarding my resignation. I stated that we, as the CHP, should resign. Our chairman said that resignation is an option but the situation is still fresh. It made me happy that some other members of the CHP are also thinking like me,” said Akkiraz in a post early on Monday.

Akkiraz added that opposition parties should come together against the AK Party government, which failed to take any responsibility for the Soma mine disaster.
