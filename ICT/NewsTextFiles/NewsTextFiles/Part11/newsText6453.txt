
New Delhi : Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi Monday said he had failed in fulfilling the party's expectations, and offered to resign from his post following the party's poll debacle, the Congress said.

Party general secretary Janardan Dwivedi said Rahul's offer to step down, along with that of his mother and party president Sonia Gandhi, was rejected.

"Rahul said he felt there is lack of accountability in the party, and that he could not fulfill the expectations the party had from him... He said he would start the tradition of accountability in the party, and offered to resign," Dwivedi told reporters Monday.

"The whole Congress Working Committee refused to discuss the proposal... They said it will not solve the problem," he said.

Dwivedi also said that both Sonia and Rahul Gandhi appreciated the way outgoing Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had led the UPA government for 10 years.
