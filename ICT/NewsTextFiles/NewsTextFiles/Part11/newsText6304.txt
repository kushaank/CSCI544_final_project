
Closure of a mine at Wongawilli near Dapto has been averted for now as workers voted Monday morning to continue negotiations over wages and conditions.

The Indian owned Wollongong Coal runs two mines in the Illawarra employing around 300 people.

Workers at the company's other mine at Russell Vale north of Wollongong voted on Friday against suspending their salaries and pay increases until the mine's fortunes improve.

CFMEU mining official Bob Timbs says workers at Wongawilli voted in favour of changing their pay and conditions.

"This morning we met with our members to discuss the future of the Wongawilli Mine," he said.

"As a result of that meeting our membership has endorsed us with a mandate to go and negotiate with the company to vary the current enterprise agreement in an attempt to keep the Wongawilli mine viable."

Afternoon shift workers are due to meet with mine management Monday afternoon for a further update.

The call for voluntary redundancies for both mines closed on Friday May 16.
