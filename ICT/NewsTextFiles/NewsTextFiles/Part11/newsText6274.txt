
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will visit Seoul next Monday to hold talks with his counterpart Yun Byung-se, Seoul's Foreign Ministry said on Monday.

Wang's trip comes ahead of a planned visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping, which is expected next month at the earliest.

The two foreign ministers will reportedly discuss ways to prevent another nuclear test by North Korea, in the broader context of the North's nuclear program and the situation on the Korean Peninsula.

The ministers may also deliver a joint message to North Korea after the talks.

The two-day visit will be Wang's first to the South Korean capital since he became foreign minister. Wang is scheduled to visit Chong Wa Dae to hold separate meetings with President Park Geun-hye and presidential security adviser Kim Jang-soo.
