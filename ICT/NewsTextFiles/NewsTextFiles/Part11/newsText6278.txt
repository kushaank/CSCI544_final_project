
SEOUL, May 19 (Yonhap) -- The National Assembly kicked off an extraordinary session on Monday for a one-month run to discuss ways to help families of those killed in last month's ferry sinking and to uncover the cause of the tragic accident.

Rival parties agreed to open the special parliamentary session earlier this month in the aftermath of the sinking of the 6,825-ton ferry Sewol off South Korea's southwestern coast on April 16.

The accident left more than 300 people, mostly high school students, dead or missing, drawing strong public criticism over the government's emergency rescue response.

Finance Minister Hyun Oh-seok and Welfare Minister Moon Hyung-pyo were scheduled to submit government plans to assist families of the ferry victims, survivals and other people affected by the deadly accident to the parliament's finance and welfare committees on Monday. Hyun would also brief lawmakers on the government's budget for emergency rescue and safety affairs.

During the one-month session, the parties also plan to demand a parliamentary investigation into the cause of the tragic accident.
