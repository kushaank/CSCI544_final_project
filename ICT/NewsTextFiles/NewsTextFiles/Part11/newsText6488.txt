
As Parliament gets ready to embark on a new legislative term following the elections on 22-25 May, we take a look back on what has been achieved in the current one. In its seventh term, from 2009 until June this year, the EP has enjoyed greater power than ever before. For the first time it could decide on the full EU budget, as well as on big international trade agreements and nearly all EU legislation, on an equal footing with national governments represented in the EU Council.

Over the past five years the EU has faced various challenges, including the world-wide financial crisis. The EU also welcomed Croatia as its latest member state in 2013, increasing the number of MEPs from 754 to 766.

MEPs also adopted many important legislative proposals, such as an end to roaming charges by 2015 as well as plans to strengthen passenger rights, approving measures paving the way for a banking union in the EU as well as improved pension rights and supporting a tobacco directive with new measures to curb smoking. In addition it rejected the ACTA and SWIFT agreements in order to protect Europeans' rights.

The Parliament also proved very popular with visitors: some 1.4 million people paid a visit in 2009-2013, while its visitors centre already welcomed nearly 800,000 visitors by 12 May of this year.
