A 12-week-old baby girl critically injured in a King Country crash has died.

Police believe she had been sitting unrestrained on her mother's lap when the hatchback crashed into a bank on Monday morning.

There were four adults, the baby and a three-year-old sibling in the car when the driver lost control on a bend on State Highway 4 near Kopaki, north of Taumarunui.

Five of the people were correctly restrained, but the baby is believed to have been sitting on her mother's lap, Inspector Freda Grace said.

She was flown to Starship Hospital in Auckland but died early today.

Insp Grace said a baby seat was found in the boot of the car, but was unable to be fitted because there were six people in the five-seat car.

"[It] possibly could have prevented the baby suffering the critical injuries. Sadly with so many people in the car there wasn't room to fit it," Insp Grace said.

She said an investigation was looking at speed and if the car's two bald front tyres contributed to the crash.
