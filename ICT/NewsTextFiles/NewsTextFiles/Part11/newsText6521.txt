
I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone in Eagle County that has supported me thus far in the election process.

From the March Caucuses and County Assembly to the House District Assembly in April, I know that it was a significant time commitment to participate in this grassroots political process.

With your support I received the top line on the upcoming June 24 primary ballot, having received 56 percent of the delegate’s votes at the House District 26 Assembly.

Over the last two years, while hundreds of thousands of Coloradans were struggling just to make ends meet, our current representative focused on ideological pet projects. She co-sponsored legislation that would have led to the largest tax increase in Colorado history, raised utility costs for rural Coloradans, and attacked the rights and freedoms of law abiding Colorado citizens by supporting unenforceable gun laws.

We can do better. As your legislator I will focus my energy on creating and retaining good paying jobs for Coloradans. I’ll support education reform that gives parents more choice and maintains local control of education. I’ll fight against wasteful spending of your tax dollars and defend your individual rights and freedoms.
