
Johannesburg - One of Johnny Clegg 's backing vocalists has been shot and killed during a robbery in Troyville, Johannesburg, Gauteng police said on Sunday.

Bongani Masuku was killed on Saturday night in Princess Street, said Lieutenant ColonelÂ  Katlego Mogale.

Four men approached Masuku as he was parking his car and demanded a cellphone and his car keys at gun point.

Mogale said the struggle ensued and one of the men shot him several times.

The men then got into a minibus and sped off.

"The deceased then managed to drive himself to a nearby fire station where he collapsed and died."

Police were investigating a case of murder.

On his official website , Clegg said they were shocked and saddened by Masuku killing.

"We will miss him deeply and we extend our heart felt condolences to his family and all who knew him."

He described him as stalwart performer, a hardworking musician and a good friend.

Masuju began working with Clegg in 1992.

Masuku is the second member of Clegg's band to have died violently.

Dudu Zulu, a close friend and percussionist in his first group Savuka, was shot dead in KwaZulu-Natal in 1992. Clegg later dedicated the song The Crossing to him.
