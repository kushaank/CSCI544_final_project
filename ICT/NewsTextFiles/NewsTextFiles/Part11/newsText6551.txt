
Speaking to HT, Amrita Rawat said she was expelled from the ministry as a part of the chief minister’s policy of appeasement to save his government. She said that Harish Rawat should give the reason for her expulsion directly to the people if he could not explain his act before the high command.

“I have not resigned but was expelled by Harish Rawat for no rhyme or reason. Soon I will meet Sonia Gandhi and tell her about the unsuccessful one man show of the CM in the state,” she said. She said she will also go to the people of her constituency and tell them about the highhandedness of the CM.

According to sources in the government, Harish Rawat called up Amrita Rawat on Monday morning and asked her to tender her resignation from the ministry, but she refused. Amrita Rawat told the chief minister that if needed, she will put in her papers before the AICC president and not before him. He then expelled her without informing her.

When asked if she was targeted because her husband Satpal Maharaj had left the Congress and joined the BJP before elections she said, “I can’t say anything but Maharaj left the Congress openly without hiding anything from the people of Uttarakhand. He even announced he would resign from the Congress at the Congress legislative party meeting on February 1, the day Harish Rawat was administered the oath of CM,” she said.
