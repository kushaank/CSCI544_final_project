
AN MP has called for an inquiry into claims of sexual abuse at Yarl's Wood detention centre.

Keith Vaz, MP for Leicester East and chairman of the home affairs select committee, was responding to the allegations that a woman from Pakistan had been sexually assaulted at the centre in Clapham.

Serco, which runs the centre, said it had already investigated the claims.

Mr Vaz has now called for senior managers at the centre to appear before the select committee.

Director of Serco, Norman Abusin, told the BBC: "Sexual contact between residents and staff is always completely unacceptable.

"We view any complaint of this type of behaviour extremely seriously and have strict procedures for dealing with any such complaints.

"When a complaint of sexually inappropriate behaviour between a member of staff and a resident was brought to our attention in January 2011, the matter was investigated by our own team as well as by the Home Office Professional Standards Unit and Bedfordshire Police.

"All parties concluded that the allegations made against our employee were false and no criminal charges were brought."
