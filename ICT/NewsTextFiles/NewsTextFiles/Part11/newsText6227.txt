Money invested in the construction of a kindergarten for 240 places in the city of Blagoveshchensk. However, Kazakhstan has no plans to send humanitarian aid to Turkey, where an explosion at a mine killed more than 300 miners. The country has not officially requested an aid from none of the states, said Vladimir Bozhko. And for this situation not to happen in Kazakhstan, the Ministry is making all efforts, noted the head of the ministry.
