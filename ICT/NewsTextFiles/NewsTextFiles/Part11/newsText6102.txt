
The Supreme Court has rejected the review petition filed by Moonis Elahi of Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q) in the National Insurance Company Limited (NICL) scandal case.

The court questioned how Elahi could change the counsel in the case without the courtâ€™s permission. The court also adjourned the review petition of former MD Ayaz Khan Niazi for one week, asking his counsel to correct the numbering of pages of the application.

Justice Jawad Khawaja said changing counsels without any reason is illegal. SM Zafar was appearing before the court in the NICL case while Moonis Elahi presented Wasim Sajjad as his counsel.

During the hearing, Justice Mehmood Sheikh referred to two passages of court orders, saying the parliament did not approve the National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO).

Justice Khawaja said they heard the case on basis of available material and decided the application. Justice Sheikh said the case was heard on merit, asking the counsel about the status of the verdict.

In response, the counsel raised a point about paragraph 59. However, the court asked the lawyer to correct the number of pages of the decision and adjourned the case for one week.
