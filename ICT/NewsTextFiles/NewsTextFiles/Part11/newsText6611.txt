
One of Johnny Clegg's backing vocalists has been shot and killed during a robbery in Troyville, Johannesburg, Gauteng police said on Sunday.

Bongani Masuku was killed on Saturday night in Princess street, said Lt-Col Katlego Mogale. Four men approached Masuku as he was parking his car and demanded a cellphone and his car keys at gun point.

Mogale said a struggle ensued and one of the men shot him several times. The men then got into a minibus and sped off.

"The deceased then managed to drive himself to a nearby fire station where he collapsed and died."

On his official website, Clegg said they were shocked and saddened by Masuku's killing.

"We will miss him deeply and we extend our heartfelt condolences to his family and all who knew him."

Clegg described him as stalwart performer, a hardworking musician and a good friend. Masuku began working with Clegg in 1992.

Police are investigating a case of murder.
