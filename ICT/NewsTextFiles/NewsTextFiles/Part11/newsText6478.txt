
PATNA: Congress legislature party (CLP) on Monday authorized its central leadership to take a decision on extending support to the JD (U) government under a new CM in Bihar.

The party legislators, who met at the residence of CLP leader Sadanand Singh, also sought a clear directive from the party's high command about the role of the party MLAs in the state assembly.

Congress has four MLAs in the now 239-member assembly, but their significance has increased because the fledgling number of JD (U) in the house. Congress support is crucial for JD (U) government to continue in the state.

Singh, who was assembly speaker for five years during the Rabri Devi government, said he informed the party's central leadership about the recent political developments in the state and sought their directive.

"All party legislators and Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee president Ashok Choudhary were present at the CLP meeting. They were informed about the recent political developments and subsequent communication between the party's state leaders and central leadership," the CLP leader told media persons.

Asked whether Congress would support the new JD (U) government, Singh said, "So far we have not withdrawn support to the state government. But the future course of action has to be decided by the party's central leadership."

All four Congress MLAs had voted in favour of Nitish Kumar in the trust vote after his split from NDA in June last year. The party, however, went with Lalu Prasad's RJD in the just concluded parliamentary election, but it did not withdraw support to the JD (U) government. During the trust motion last year, Nitish had sailed through with the help of four Congress MLAs, as many independents and one CPI member.
