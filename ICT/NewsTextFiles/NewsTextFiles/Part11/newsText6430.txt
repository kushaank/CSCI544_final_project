
Congress leader, Satyavrat Chaturvedi on Monday agreed with party colleague and Sonia Gandhi's political secretary Ahmed Patel's views that the party must own up for the loss in the recently concluded general elections.

He also stressed on the need for rebuilding the team after deficiencies are analysed.

"I fully agree with Ahmed Patel. Democracy is about teamwork, leaders and party workers play their role. When we lose, we introspect on our deficiencies and then bounce back. It is now that we must delve on our weaknesses and then strengthen ourselves earnestly," Chaturvedi said.

When asked what would be the role of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the Congress leader tersely said: "We cannot say about the future. With the same team, we have won many and even lost at the same time. The idea is to take the loss in the right spirit as it is a mandate given by the people."

On being asked what would be the agenda of the party in its Congress Working Committee (CWC) meet today, he said: "Don't know exactly what will be discussed but in all likelihood we will stress on strengthening our party and move ahead. Even though we are in the opposition we must play as a positive role and fight for the people's right."

The Congress Working Committee (CWC) will meet in New Delh today in the wake of the party's worst-ever performance in the recently concluded Lok Sabha polls.

The meeting of the party's apex decision making body which will be chaired by party president Sonia Gandhi is expected to delve on finding out reasons behind its defeat and chalking out on its future strategy.

Accepting responsibility for the poll debacle, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi had said that the mandate in the Lok Sabha polls was clearly against the Congress and said there was a lot for the party to think about.
