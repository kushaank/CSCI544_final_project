
Under federal law, those states are allowed to impose tolls because they used a considerable amount of their own money to build their interstates. But states like Vermont, that used a lot of federal money to build the roads, aren’t allowed to charge tolls.

This could change soon because the White House is backing a plan to allow all states to charge an interstate toll if they want to. Congressman Peter Welch supports the change.

“I’d be in favor of letting the states have authority to make that decision and then of course that would be up to Montpelier and the Governor,” said Welch.

Sue Minter is the deputy secretary of Vermont’s Transportation Agency. She’s very interested in this subject.

Minter says a new electronic tolling system could be put into place without a lot of expensive personnel costs for people to work in toll booths.

Minter says it’s important to study the tolling options because gas tax revenues are no longer keeping pace with the financing needs of the state’s transportation infrastructure.

Minter says her agency is just beginning to explore the tolling option and she says it could be a number of years before the administration makes a decision about imposing a toll system on Vermont’s interstates.
