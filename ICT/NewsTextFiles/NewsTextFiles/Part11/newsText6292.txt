
Kuwaiti men used their fists and head gear to battle each other during a fight at a shopping mall in the Gulf emirate.

A brief YouTube film published in the Kuwaiti Arabic language daily Al Anba showed the men, wearing traditional Arabian dishdasha (gown) taking off their head gear and using it to lash their adversaries in the fight triggered by an argument between two.
