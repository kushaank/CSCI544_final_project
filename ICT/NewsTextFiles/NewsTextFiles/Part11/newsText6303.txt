
James Corden is set to become a father for the second time.

According to the Daily Mirror, the Gavin and Stacey star and his charity worker wife Julia will welcome their new addition later this year.

"James and Julia have loved every minute of becoming parents to their toddler Max and were keen to give him a brother or sister who is close in age," a source told the newspaper.

"They're delighted to be pregnant again and can't wait to expand the family."

The 35-year-old comedian and actor and his partner, who got married in September 2012, are already parents to three-year-old son Max.

It was Max's birth in 2011 that inspired Corden to become more health conscious and shed some weight.

"I just thought, 'Enough now. Get a grip. I want to be around to enjoy this'," he said after slimming down to 16 stones from 21 stones.

"Being married, having kids - it changes you. It's the best thing in the world."

The baby news comes after the couple stepped out together at the year's TV Baftas. Harry Styles's pal could be seen placing a protective arm around Julia as she showed off her growing baby bump.
