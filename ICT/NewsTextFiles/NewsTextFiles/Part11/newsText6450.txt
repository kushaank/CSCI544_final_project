
Patna: The political crisis in Bihar arising out of the  resignation of Nitish Kumar as chief minister following the severe  drubbing that Janata Dal (United) suffered in the Lok Sabha election  remained unresolved with the party failing to elect its ‘new’ leader.

All JD (U) MLAs insisted that Kumar should continue, but Nitish Kumar refused to do so and sought time till Monday.

Earlier, RJD and Congress convened meetings of their legislators on Monday to discuss the emerging political scenario.

Accordingly, JD(U) legislature party meeting has been called again tomorrow, Singh said.

Earlier during the day, Yadav faced stormy protest from Kumar's supporters for his stand outside the chief minister's house.
