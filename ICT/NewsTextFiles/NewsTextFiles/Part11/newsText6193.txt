
New Delhi, May 19: The Supreme Court today granted three weeks’ bail to Tehelka founder-editor Tarun Tejpal, accused of sexually assaulting a junior colleague, to perform the last rites of his mother.

However, he couldn’t attend the cremation or perform the last rites apparently because of delay in completing the bail formalities. Tejpal’s mother Shakuntala died of cancer on Sunday.

The bench of Justices B.S. Chauhan and A.K. Sikri granted bail to Tejpal after senior counsel U.U. Lalit mentioned   his mother’s death around 1.20pm in the open court.
