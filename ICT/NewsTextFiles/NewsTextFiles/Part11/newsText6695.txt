Former New Orleans Saint Steve Gleason was taken to the emergency room at a local hospital on Monday and doctors performed a surgical procedure on him late in the afternoon, a source close to the situation told WDSU.

The operation followed the publication of the following "tweets" on Gleason's Twitter account: "I am heading in for a semi-planned tracheotomy tonight.. I believe in the power of intention, prayer, meditation, etc. I appreciate your unified focus on healing #NoWhiteFlags."

Gleason is battling ALS -- or Lou Gehrig's Disease -- which has taken a devastating toll on his body and has left him unable to speak and with extremely limited mobility.

Since disclosing the illness, Gleason has become one of the most visible proponents for ALS research and an advocate for those fighting the disease.

Earlier in the day, Gleason awoke and was struggling to breathe, the source told WDSU. He was taken to the emergency room at a Jefferson Parish hospital, and doctors performed a tracheotomy to help alleviate the problem.

The source described it as a hastily scheduled surgery, but noted that family knew such a procedure could one day be necessary.

A tracheotomy is a procedure that opens an airway in the neck of the patient, allowing air to flow through a small tube directly into the trachea -- or windpipe.

Gleason spends most of the year in southeast Louisiana, but has also resided at times at a home in Idaho.
