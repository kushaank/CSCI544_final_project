
KAKUMA, 19 May 2014 (IRIN) - Physical space and timely protection support for children are among the most pressing needs in northwestern Kenya's Kakuma refugee camp amid a continuing flood of people, for the most part minors, fleeing conflict in South Sudan.

Since the eruption of hostilities in mid-December, some 36,450 people have crossed the border between the two countries. (In all, some 328,000 have fled South Sudan to its various neighbouring states).

Some 750 of those arriving in Kenya were children who fall into the category of unaccompanied which means they arrived with no parents or adult relatives.

More than 5,000 were "separated" which means they arrived with an adult relative who was neither a parent nor a usual caregiver.

Under normal circumstances, the needs of both groups, such as psychosocial support, tracing family members, foster care, and other protection needs, are assessed on arrival in a camp, or at least within two weeks.
