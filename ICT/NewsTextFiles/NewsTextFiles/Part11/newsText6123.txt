GRAND RAPIDS, MI – A Grand Rapids podiatrist once named in a 67-count indictment over alleged illegal Medicare billing has pleaded guilty to a single misdemeanor charge, records show.

Dr. Martin Glenn Hoffmeister was accused of fraudulently billing Medicare $153,378 for toenail services.

With the case set for trial this week, those charges were dropped and Hoffmeister instead pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for converting to his own use less than $100 in Medicare funds.

Early on, Hoffmeister denied the allegations.

Defense attorney Larry Willey, in response to government’s trial brief, said that the allegations involved 67 office visits for five patients, with Medicare paying $3,200 on their behalf. He said that disagreement over treatment procedures led to the charges, not fraudulent billing.

The misdemeanor will not have any effect on Hoffmeister's license, Willey said.

Hoffmeister joined his father’s practice in 1987, and has worked along – with two full-time workers – since his father’s death in 2006. He sees mostly elderly patients who have been patients for many years.
