
A water main valve failure left some Edgewood residents without water for several hours Monday morning.

County workers battled a breach in a six-inch valve at the end of Broadneck Crossing Road, off of Willoughby Beach Road, which was reported at 8 a.m., county spokeswoman Sherrie Johnson said.

Service was restored by about 11:35 a.m..

The incident cut off water to residents in the surrounding development of Broadneck Crossing.

The break was caused by a mechanical failure of the valve, Johnson said.

It did not cause any flooding of the surrounding streets and nearby schools were not affected, she said.
