
The Federal Supreme Court on Monday adjourned the case of nine Arabs on trial for forming a cell of the terror organisation Al Qaeda to May 26.

The presiding judge of the court adjourned the second hearing to admit the statements of the prosecution witnesses and suspects.

Khaleej Times has learnt that four of the six lawyers in the case are from outside the UAE, while the other two were delegated by the court to defend the suspects. On May 5, the State Security Department of the Federal Supreme Court held the first hearing in the case, which was attended by seven of the suspects.

Five of the suspects are from Tunisia, two from Palestine, one from Jordan and one from Lebanon.

They are aged between 25 to 55. According to the prosecution’s indictment, a copy of which KT has obtained, they are accused of joining Al Nusra Front.

The Al Nusra Front is accused of fighting the Syrian government.

They were also allegedly assigned to form a cell inside the UAE to “promote (the organisation’s) purposes and goals, and to recruit new members”.

They also allegedly supervised and ran the website of Sinam al-Islam forum.

The website is said to publish information about Al Qaeda with the intent of promoting its ideas, recruiting new members and sending them to carry out terrorist activities outside the UAE.

The suspects will stand trial under the Anti Terrorism and Information Technology acts.

According to Article 3 of the Anti Terror Act, establishing or running an organisation for committing terror-related crimes is punishable by death or life imprisonment.

According to the same act, attending the training of a terror organisation or recruiting members for it is punishable by imprisonment for not less than 10 years.

According to the IT Act, setting up a website or other IT facilities for terror organisations is punishable by imprisonment for not less than five years.
