WASHINGTON – Sen. Claire McCaskill earned an extra $70,000 last year — an advance for her forthcoming tell-all book about Missouri's 2012 Senate campaign.

McCaskill's most recent financial disclosure form, filed last week, shows that her publisher — Simon & Schuster — gave her $70,000 as part of its deal to publish her political tome.

The Missouri Democrat said most of the money she earns from the book will not go into her own pocket.

"The majority of all income I receive from this book will go to my co-writer and charity," McCaskill said. Freelance journalist Terry Ganey is helping her write the book.

McCaskill announced last spring that she was working on a behind-the-scenes account of her headline-grabbing Senate race against then-Rep. Todd Akin. She has promised to detail how she helped boost Akin in the Republican primary, because she believed he would be the easiest candidate for her to beat.

Her strategy worked. After winning a three-way GOP primary, Akin caused a national furor when he told a TV interviewer that women who are victims of "legitimate rape" rarely get pregnant because their bodies have a way of blocking that.

National Republicans scorned Akin and tried — unsuccessfully — to force him out of the race. McCaskill walloped the St. Louis County Republican on Election Day.

She has said her book will be out before the end of this year.

McCaskill probably doesn't need the extra cash, since she is one of the Senate's richest lawmakers. According to her financial disclosure form, McCaskill and her husband — Joseph Shepard — have assets worth at least $16.9 million and as much as $28.3 million.

Lawmakers only have to report their financial holdings in broad ranges, so determining exact net worth is impossible.

Most of the assets McCaskill reported are in Shepard's name. He is a real estate investor.
