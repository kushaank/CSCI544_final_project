
Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) chief Vaiko met Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Monday and said that the latter has promised attention to issues of minorities and killings of Tamils by Sri Lanka.

MDMK is an ally of NDA (National Democratic Alliance) in Tamil Nadu.

"He told me that the minorities within a short time will realize, I (Modi) am protecting everybody. In Kargil, where the minorities form the population, there BJP has won. And one more thing I said in this state five years back, hundreds and thousands of Tamils were massacred and brutally killed by the racist Sri Lankan government with all the logistics, support and help of the UPA (United Progressive Alliance) government guided by Sonia Gandhi," said Vaiko.

India and Sri Lanka are often embroiled in situations where both parties claim to have arrested fishermen for wandering away and crossing international water boundaries.

Though fishermen in Tamil Nadu have been constantly fighting to demand safety from the government, Sri Lanka claims that poaching and illegal fishing by Indian fishermen depletes the catches of its own fishermen.

Meanwhile Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSR Congress Party) chief Jaganmohan Reddy also met Modi to discuss economic development of Seemandhra which comes into effect on June 02.

"See here the fact is he is already on 283 MPs, he doesn't need any of us. The most important thing is Andhra Pradesh state needs him. We want our prime minister to be proactive. We need him. We were never opposed to him. We would definitely be giving him issue-based support. And we expect a great deal of help from him for our state of Andhra Pradesh," said Reddy.
