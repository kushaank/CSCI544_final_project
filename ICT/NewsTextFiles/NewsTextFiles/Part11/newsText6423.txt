
I agree with Mark Whitehead (“ Tax reform should not hurt consumers ," Local View column, May 15) that Congress should not be seeking to raise taxes on the oil and gas industry.

With Nebraska sitting at the crossroads of pipelines, railroads and highways leading across the country, anything that impacts the cost of energy impacts our state. As we all know, taxes eventually flow to the consumer. Higher taxes on oil and gas companies would mean higher costs for transportation, for agriculture and for heating and cooling our homes and businesses.

There are more than 40,000 small businesses in Nebraska. With the average small business hiring 10 people, it’s easy to see that a slight increase in energy costs could quickly mean a small business wouldn’t have the ability to add another person or might have to leave a vacancy unfilled. It may be tempting to target Big Oil with higher taxes, but the facts remain that we -- small businesses and consumers -- would ultimately pay the price.
