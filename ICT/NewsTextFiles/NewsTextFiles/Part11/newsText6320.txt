
The London Underground could be ‘completely closed’ this bank holiday weekend after staff working in the power control room reportedly threatened to walk out.

The employees could stage the industrial action just after midnight on Saturday because of ‘worsening conditions’ and would return to work on Tuesday morning, according to the Unite trade union.

The 40 technicians are responsible for the power on 270 underground stations and it is thought the whole network would have to close if the walkout went ahead.

Arbitration service Acas was locked in talks today trying to stop the action.

‘There is a real possibility that the Underground could close down over the bank holiday weekend,’ said Unite’s Hugh Roberts.
