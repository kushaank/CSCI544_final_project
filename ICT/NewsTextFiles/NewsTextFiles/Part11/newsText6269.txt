
Korean actor Kim Soo-hyun surprised his fans in Japan when he revealed that he had never kissed a woman besides his partners in movies and television dramas.

On a fan meeting named “Kim Soo-hyun Asia Tour 1st Memories” in Japan on Sunday, the 26-year-old was asked about his secret to being a good on-screen kisser, according to OSEN’s reports.

“Actually, I have never been kissed besides acting,” Kim was quoted as saying. About 4,000 fans, who packed the meeting, greeted him with shouts and enthusiasm.

“I was able to shoot kiss scenes by image training in my head, thinking about how to make a good kiss scene. The rest is thanks to the director who makes the best out of it!” he said.

The fan meeting was part of a seven-country Asia tour that started in Seoul in March. He also visited Thailand, China, Singapore and Taiwan.

The Korean actor plans to return home after attending another event in China.
