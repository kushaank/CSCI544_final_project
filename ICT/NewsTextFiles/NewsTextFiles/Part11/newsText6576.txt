
I heard a program on NPR this weekend telling that the Nigerian scams are based on these letters appealing to the most gullible, and eliminating the skeptics. Evidently, it is a very effective technique.

Dear friend,

Your immediate reply needed please.

My name is dr.ousman diallo  from the Republic of guinea conakry.

I am presently in morocco, I have a confidential transaction worth of 25 Million U.S Dollars to discuss with you. Kindly let me know if you are interested so that i can email you some more details about what i really need you to do for me and for us to organise, how and where to meet for a better discussion.

We would need to adopt one attitude “discreet” for something that is of a private and secret life.

Thanks.

Regards,
