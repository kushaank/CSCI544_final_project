
Lam Tat Fei, a boatman for bunker supplier Sea Hub Energy has been sentenced to six weeks in prison and given a $200 fine for taking part in a bunker buyback scam, news site Asia One reports .

Last year, Lam conspired with colleague Jason Choo Soon Beng to pay bribes in exchange for a false declaration that the vessel received a delivery of 2,662 tonnes of marine fuel when the delivery was actually 120 tonnes short.

Lam received $200 for helping with the fraud.

Antonov Sergey, chief engineer of the ship, Frontline Suezmax Front Splendour, was sentenced last year to two weeks in jail and a S$30,000 ($23,400) fine.

Choo and the marine surveyor involved in the deception, Victor Loh Tuck Seng, were also sentenced to jail terms and fines in the case.

While the other defendants pleaded guilty to various charges, Lam denied three counts of corruption, but a district court convicted him on Wednesday.
