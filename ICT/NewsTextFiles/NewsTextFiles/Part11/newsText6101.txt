
Kenya: Former Chief Registrar of the Judiciary ( CRJ ) Gladys Boss Shollei yesterday told the High Court in Nairobi that she no longer needed her job back.

Through her lawyer Donald Kipkorir, Mrs Shollei said she has no intentions of becoming the CRJ even after the Industrial Court earlier quashed her dismissal terming it unconstitutional.

“You will recall that she wanted to come back but allow me to make it clear that she (Shollei) has no intentions of becoming the Chief Registrar of the Judiciary ,” Kipkorir told the court .

Mrs Shollei had through her lawyer in March written to Chief Justice William Mutunga asking him to “advise on when she can resume office”.

Kipkorir had argued that the implication of the judgment was that Shollei’s dismissal from office was a nullity and her Constitutional rights were violated.

But Kipkorir, who made submissions during a hearing of an appeal by the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) challenging the Industrial Court ruling, was categorical that Shollei was no longer interested in her previous job.

He further submitted that the purpose of the petition at the Industrial Court challenging the ousting of her client was purely based on the process followed by JSC in dismissing her.

JSC lawyers Paul Muite and Issa Mansur argued that the Industrial Court was not a High Court and therefore could not interpret the Constitution. But Kipkorir responded by saying that such an argument was absurd since JSC had not raised the issue at the Industrial Court or before Justice Mumbi Ngugi who transferred the matter to the Industrial Court.

“Furthermore the Constitution sets article 162 establishing the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal and High Court. The High Court includes Labour Relations and Environment Court which are high court s, not lesser court s. All High Courts can determine questions of the Constitution,” Kipkorir argued.
