Torrential downpours couldn’t keep away the more than 30 bicyclists who pedaled to the Bike to Work Day stop in Gaithersburg on Friday.

At the corner of Great Seneca Highway and Orchard Ridge Drive, cyclists stopped for free T-shirts, food and drinks, according to a city news release.

Because of the day’s rainy weather, Gaithersburg had an event volunteer stand at the same Gaithersburg stop on Monday to hand out T-shirts to any Bike To Work Day registered participant who cycled by the area. About 15 to 20 cyclists visited the stop Monday, according to Britta Monaco, the city’s public information director.

T-shirts can also be picked up from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekdays through May 30 at the Gaithersburg Department of Public Works, 800 Rabbitt Road, the release said.

In the Washington metropolitan area, more than 10,000 commuters took part in the initiative which featured 79 pit stops, including the one in Gaithersburg, throughout the region.
