
Julie Engbloom and Laurie Brown were the first couple to be married at the Melody Ballroom on Monday after Oregon's ban on same-sex marriage was struck down. They entered the room to cheers and flashing cameras.

" We don't have music, so I want everyone to hum the wedding march," Judge Beth Allen said.

Engbloom and Brown knew they wanted to get married as soon as possible. When their friend Judge Allen asked them to be her "first couple" of the day, they said yes. Allen had refrained from performing marriages under the ban on same sex marriage.

Engbloom is an attorney, and Brown works as a freelance advertiser. They have been together for ten years.

After the ceremony, a hoard of cameras and microphones swarmed the couple. Brown claimed she was shy, but ended up speaking more than Engbloom.

"The overwhelming response of positiveness has been refreshing, amazing surprising," she said. "It's the best day of my life."
