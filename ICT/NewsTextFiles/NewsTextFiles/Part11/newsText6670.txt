
Take a business class. Be smart about your industry; market yourself with savvy. Stand up for yourself and don’t allow your skills to be taken advantage of. Anytime you can enlarge your network of professionals, take that opportunity. Get out in the creative community and make a presence; people won’t hire you if they don’t know you.
