
Go to Starbucks corporate website and the words, "Say yes to what's next," stand out like a rainbow.

So what is Starbucks planning? The website promotes a cool summer "frappuccino" blended beverage, but it's what it doesn't say that is most interesting -- and troublesome.

Recently, Starbucks announced that it would be expanding its line of pricey and trendy drink offerings by selling ... (this is not a typo) ... alcoholic drinks.

Holy moly Guatemala Antigua medium roast!

According to company CEO Howard Schultz, Starbucks' new strategy will help grow profits by increasing the average sale per customer.

Starbucks says it will only sell alcoholic drinks in the evenings, which is a nice gesture but doesn't soften the shock for a contingent of customers who gather at the upscale cafes to avoid alcohol. Those people include recovering alcoholics.

It's not known for sure how many 12-step program clients meet at Starbucks to talk with colleagues and mentors, but it's fair to say that a high percentage of recovering alcoholics drink coffee (88 percent of 23 million according to the journal Alcoholism, October 2008). Starbucks, with its welcoming environment, must certainly get its share from this group.

Alcoholic drinks will cost more than coffee, and Starbucks is sure to ring up profits. But the company might also lose thousands of customers who don't like the hybrid-bar atmosphere that the new strategy creates.

And what about Starbucks cafes located across the land on numerous college campuses, including UMass Lowell? It doesn't seem a good fit at all.

The coffee klatch will never be the same again.
