
Cape Canaveral, Florida: SpaceX's Dragon cargo capsule returned to Earth from the International Space Station (ISS) on Sunday one month after it was launched from Canaveral, Florida.

The privately funded cargo capsule splashed down in the Pacific Ocean Sunday afternoon, bringing back nearly 2 tons of science experiments and old equipments for NASA.

“Splashdown is confirmed! Welcome home, Dragon,” SpaceX posted on Twitter.

According to NASA, the commercial cargo ship Dragon was released from  the ISS' robotic arm at 9:26 a.m. ET, and made contact with the Pacific Ocean at 3:05 p.m. ET, 300 miles off the west coast of Baja California.

Using a robotic arm, space station commander Steven Swanson released the Dragon capsule at 9:26 a.m. ET (1326 GMT) as the craft zoomed more than 260 miles above the South Pacific.

“Very nice to have a vehicle that can take your science, equipment and maybe someday even humans back to Earth,” Swanson told Mission Control.

SpaceX's Dragon launched on April 18, arrived at the space station April 20 with a full load of supplies. It is the only space station resupply spacecraft capable of returning items to Earth.

Sunday's mission was the third of 12 cargo-resupply trips under SpaceX's $1.6 billion NASA  contract. SpaceX's fourth trip might happen in August.
