
The son of convicted killer Helen Milner who is accused of attacking former All Black Justin Marshall in Queenstown has pleaded not guilty and elected trial by jury in Invercargill.

Adam David Kearns, 23, along with Tai Samuel Neilson, 25, were charged with assault with the intent to injure after an incident which unfolded near the entrance to Club 88 on Shotover St on Good Friday.

Marshall, 40, did not suffer serious injuries.

Kearns, Milner's son, was expected to appear in the Queenstown District Court on July 14 for a case review hearing.

After the incident Kearns told Fairfax Media he would fight the charge.

At the time of the incident he was in Queenstown celebrating his birthday and was unaware who Marshall was when the alleged incident took place.

Kearns and Neilson had been drinking at Club 88 and claim Marshall was there also.

The alleged altercation occurred as they left.

Neilson was expected to appear in court in Christchurch on June 9.

No date has been set for Kearns' pre-trial or trial hearings.
