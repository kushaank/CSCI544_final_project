Ducks Unlimited reports the most important time in a duckling�s life is during its first two weeks of life.

MILFORD>> A mallard duckling who ventured out of his nest and refused to return is settling into a new home this week.

�Jackson,� the name given to the tiny fuzzball, was found wandering around the Huron Valley Chamber of Commerce building on Union Street Monday.

�We saw him and then we saw a mother duck and all these ducklings walking around,� said Toni Hochstein, chamber administrative assistant.

A landscaper was working in front of the building preparing the site for a chamber open house Wednesday, May 21. Staff called a local Milford farm for advice �� and two sisters, Jessy and Jenny Feigley, ages 18 and 20, showed up to provide assistance.

When they arrived, the mother and brood, eight to 10 strong, had returned to their nest located in dried grasses outside the chamber offices.

The Feigley sisters repeatedly tried to place the stubborn duckling back with the mother duck, but he kept turning around and heading back out onto a nearby brick ledge.

After telephone discussions with Department of Natural Resources biologists, the Feigleys transported the duckling to a Milford woman who specializes in raising wild birds. Hochstein said officials told her once the bird is older, it will eventually fly away.

Later in the morning, the mother duck also decided to move out, said Hochstein.

�She and the ducklings waddled away, hopefully to Central Park,� she said.

Hochstein said it was quite an unusual morning for all.
