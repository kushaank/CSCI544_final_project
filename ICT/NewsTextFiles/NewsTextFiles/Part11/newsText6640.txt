
Naples, May 19 - A conference to promote Mediterranean cultural heritage will take place in the heart of the archeological site of ancient Pompeii on Tuesday and Wednesday.     The international conference "The Memory of the Future. The value of communication in the cultural dialogue of the Mediterranean cities" explores the role of institutions and communications in valorising Mediterranean cultural heritage.     National and international policy makers are to meet with high profile members of Mediterranean media on three main themes: dialogue and culture in the Mediterranean; culture as an economic value and identity of a city; and communication's role in cultural information in the Mediterranean.     The conference will view the Mediterranean basin as a hub of cultural exchange, especially in major cities - Naples among them - which have successfully assimilated the area's composite characteristics.      The Mediterranean will be observed as a multi-ethnic sea that, in addition to seeing periods of conflict, has also lived with long periods of cultural coexistence, and today disseminates peaceful cultural exchange through a host of cultural events, like cinema, music and theatre festivals as well as exhibitions and photography shows, which provide reciprocal enrichment through the exchange of experiences, reflections and memories.       ANSA's Mediterranean network ANSAmed, founded ten years ago in Naples, on May 5, 1994, has played a significant role in the exchange of information and cultural communication with countries on the shores of the Mediterranean with the aim of contributing a class of new communicators that have a clear Mediterranean identity.        A number of high-profile guests are expected in the digs of Pompeii, one of the most visited archeological sites in the world whose only rival in the Mediterranean basin are the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt.     Participants include Italian MP Khalid Chaouki, Chairman of the Cultural Commission of the Parliamentary Union for the Mediterranean, and Francesca Barracciu, the undersecretary for tourism and culture for the Italian government.     Other attendees are Riccardo Monti, president of foreign-trade institute ICE;  Luigi Nicolais, president of National Research Council CNR; and Paul Walton, executive director of the Anna Lindt Foundation, who will be welcomed by Campania Governor Stefano Caldoro, who is pushing for the key boost to Pompeii's upkeep that will come with the Great Pompeii Project.     Media debate will be fuelled by ANSA Editor-in-Chief Luigi Contu, whose ANSAMed desk is covering the two-day event, as well as by Il Mattino Editor Alessandro Barbano and foreign guests of the calibre of: Laure Sleiman Saab, director of the Lebanon's news agency NNA; Mohamed Sabreen, editor of Egyptian daily Al-Ahram; Tunisian journalism school chief Abdelkrim Hizaoui;  and Riyadh El-Hassan, presidente of the Alliance of Mediterranean News Agencies (AMAN).
