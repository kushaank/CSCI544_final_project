
New Delhi : The Supreme Court Monday granted three weeks' interim bail to Tehelka founder-editor Tarun Tejpal so that he could perform last rites of his mother, who passed away in Goa Sunday.

The apex court bench of Justice B.S. Chauhan and Justice A.K. Sikri passed the orders granting Tejpal interim bail after holding the hearing on his plea in their chamber.

A former junior woman colleague last year accused Tejpal of rape during ThinkFest, a high-profile conference organised by the Tehelka founder in Goa.

The victim claimed she was sexually assaulted twice Nov 7 and 8.
