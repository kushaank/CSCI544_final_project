
The British inquiry into the 2003 Iraq War has hit a major stumbling block, as White House officials have been unable to find an â€œabsolutely criticalâ€� letter sent by former Prime Minister Tony Blair to George W. Bush.

Although public hearings regarding the Iraq War's buildup have   been finished since 2011, when exactly the publication of the   Iraq Inquiry will occur remains unknown. According to the   Telegraph, the primary issue holding back the probeâ€™s results is   a debate over letters sent between Bush and Blair, one of which   has reportedly gone missing.

Referred to as the â€œwith you whateverâ€� letter, inquiry leader Sir   John Chilcot is looking to publish it alongside other Bush-Blair   correspondence. Many have portrayed the letter as evidence of   Blair offering Bush absolute and uncritical support for his   desire to go to war, but the problem now is that White House   officials say they can't find it.

For his part, Blair has denied that the reported wording of his   letter is accurate. The documentâ€™s contents were first brought to   public attention in a book titled â€œThe End of the Party,â€� by   Andrew Rawnsley.

In response, Blair was blamed for holding up publication of the   investigation â€“ an allegation the former leader himself has   dismissed.

Government officials have stated that while theyâ€™re interested in   publishing as much content as they can, they must also take into   account national security concerns and weigh whether or not   making these records public would affect the relationship between   the US and UK going forward.

Speaking on the issue a couple of days later, British Prime   Minister David Cameron said the wait has been â€œfrustrating,â€� but   added that publication should occur before 2014 is over.

By this time it is well known that the U.S.'s motive for war had nothing at all to do with WMD's.  It was part of a larger plan documented in the Policy for a New American Century, to militarily control the world and the critical resources it holds, such as OIL. There is no doubt at all that Bush, Blair, Cheney, Rice, Rumsfeld and all the good old boys and girls are war criminals and that they should be executed in front of the White House.  They, as well as Obama and company, are all traitors to the welfare of American and British citizens.  They continually lie to us and put us all in peril.
