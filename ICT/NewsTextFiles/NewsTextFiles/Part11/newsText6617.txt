
UN Spokesman Stephane Dujarric said that he could not confirm the receipt of a request from the self-proclaimed Lugansk People's Republic (LNR) to recognize its sovereignty. The official UN spokesperson said he was not aware that such an appeal had been received. The recognition of a new state is an act that only other member states of the UN may grant, Dujarric reminded.

Earlier in the day it was reported that the self-proclaimed Lugansk People's Republic wrote a letter to the United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon with an official request to recognize LNR as a sovereign and independent region.

On May 11 Lugansk and Donetsk regions that never recognized the legitimacy of Kiev authorities held referendums on greater autonomy where the majority of population voted for proclamation of independent "people's republics." On Sunday Lugansk elected a head leader and passed a new constitution on Sunday.
