“Those who think they will cause instability and hold protests in the country, let them know that we are strong and we will deal with them accordingly,” said Mr Kithure.

He was flanked by Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi, Kimani Ichung’wa (Kikuyu), Ann Nyokabi (Kiambu County MP), Alice Ng’ang’a (Thika) and Jude Njomo (Kiambu Town).

Mr Wamatangi, while vowing that Jubilee MPs will defend the Government to the hilt, said: “Mwenye ataleta nyoko nyoko tutaonana na yeye.” (We will deal with whoever will try to cause trouble)”.

Ichungwa reminded outspoken CORD leaders that Jubilee leaders tooÂ  have “mouths to speak”. The Kikuyu MP also defended Mr Kenyatta’s move to give more powers to county commissioners and other administrators, and termed those against the decision “real enemies of devolution”.
