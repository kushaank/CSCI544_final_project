
It was a scorcher in Tallinn with a temperature of 31 C, while Kunda set a new national record for the month of May - 33.6 C.

The previous record dated from 2007 in Pärnu - 31.2 C.

The heat, accompanied by slightly hazy sunshine, came from a pocket of high pressure localized over the eastern Baltic, which also sent temperatures into the high 20s for a second straight day in the coastal towns of Haapsalu and Pärnu.

Relief is in sight, but not necessarily tomorrow. Tuesday will bring a chance of thunderstorms again and highs of 17-30 C. The high range will be experienced in the northeast, while Tallinn should be around 24 C. Wednesday and Thursday are looking like 13-23 C with chance of scattered showers.
