
COLUMBIA, Md. (AP) -- A skateboarding and snowboarding store at a Maryland mall where a gunman killed two employees before fatally shooting himself is reopening.

The Zumiez store in the Columbia Mall is reopening Monday after being closed for four months.

The store has been completely remodeled since Jan. 25, when police say 19-year-old Darion Aguilar shot the two workers and then turned the gun on himself.

The store's new design recognizes the two employees who were killed, 21-year-old Brianna Benlolo and 25-year-old Tyler Johnson, with tiles bearing their initials: "B'' and "T."
