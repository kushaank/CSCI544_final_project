
The worker's singing a slightly-altered version of 'This Is How We Do It' irritated his colleagues so much that they complained to their line manager, who issued an official warning telling him to 'be quieter.'

S. Granitz/WireImage Despite the popularity of Montell Jordan's song at the time of its release in February 1995, the factory workers didn't appreciated their co-worker's version.

A factory worker was disciplined for singing "this is how we glue it" each time he went to the sticking station.

The man, who has not been named, became the bane of his colleagues' lives when he repeatedly broke into his own version of Montell Jordan's smash hit.

Fed-up with his cheery antics, they complained to their line manager who promptly issued an official warning.

"Complaints from other employees. [Worker] is singing loudly 'this is how we glue it' at the gluing station,'" his boss wrote on the 'details of occurrence' form.

"Be quieter," he then scrawled under the section asking what the worker needed to do to improve his attitude.

It's not clear where in the U.S. the note was written, but it went viral soon after being posted on Reddit.
