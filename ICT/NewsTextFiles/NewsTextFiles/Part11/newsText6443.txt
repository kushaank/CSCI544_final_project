
Another rezoning request for property between McCutchen Drive and 18th Street will be considered by the Rolla City Council tonight.

Another rezoning request for property between McCutchen Drive and 18th Street will be considered by the Rolla City Council tonight.

The 2.71-acre lot owned by Robert L. Davis is zoned R-1, single-family district. Davis had once requested that it be changed to R-3, mult-family district. There was opposition to that change, and he withdrew the request.

This time, Davis is asking for a change to R-2 zoning. This would allow construction of a 16-unit nursing home.

The Rolla Planning and Zoning Commission has recommended the rezoning with conditions that included a 15-foot buffer yard along the southern border of the tract, half that if a sight-proof fence of at least seven feet in height is built.

A public hearing on the request is scheduled; the agenda notes that there will be a first reading of the rezoning ordinance, but that could be waived and a final reading heard, too, if the council waives the rules.

That same lot is part of a tract that Davis has also requested be replatted, another request that will be taken up tonight by the council at its 6:30 p.m. meeting in the council chambers at Rolla City Hall.

• Rezoning of lots on Oaklane Drive from R-1 to R-3, requested by Ken Boeker, will be the subject of a public hearing and, at least, the first reading of an ordinance.

• Paragon Business Solutions Inc. will make a presentation.

• Rolla Municipal Utilities General Manager Rodney Bourne will make the second quarter report.

• An ordinance related to Americans With Disabilities Act improvements along Bishop Avenue from 10th Street to Lanning Lane will be heard.

• An ordnance to allow sale of a remnant parcel of property to Ridgeview Christian Church will be approved.
