
New Delhi, May 19 : A 40-year-old man has been sent to jail for five years by a Delhi court for sexually assaulting a six-year-old girl.

While handing down the jail term to Delhi resident Pramod Kumar, the court also imposed a fine of Rs 9,000 on him.

“It stands proved that the convict took advantage of tender age of the victim child, who was only 6/7-years-old at the time of incident, and enticed her and took her to his room, where he confined the victim child, slapped her and also sexually assaulted her….,” Additional Sessions Judge Illa Rawat said.

The court also asked the Delhi government to pay Rs 50,000 compensation to the victim under its ‘Restorative and Compensatory Justice’ scheme.

The court convicted Kumar under various provisions of the IPC, including kidnapping, and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act for sexually assaulting the minor.

According to the prosecution in July last year, Kumar had sexually assaulted the victim by taking her to his room on the pretext of giving her toffees. The child’s family and the man were living in the same building as tenants.

The girl was rescued by her mother who reached there on hearing her cries, it said.

After the crime, he fled from the spot. Later when he returned to his room in August 2013, he was apprehended by the neighbourers and handed over to the police.

In his defence, Kumar had claimed that the victim’s mother had taken Rs 4,000 from him and she falsely implicated him in the case as she did not want to repay it.
