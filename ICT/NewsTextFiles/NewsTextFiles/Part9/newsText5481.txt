
KOLKATA: The transport department has turned out to be the saving grace just when it seems that the rain god has turned his back on the charred city.

With the heat wave showing no signs of retreat, the department has decided to roll out air-conditioned Volvo buses along 10 new routes across the city. These buses, bought under the JNNURM scheme, will be operated by the Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC).

"We are rolling out 63 Volvo buses immediately - 41 in May and 22 in June. These buses will crisscross the city. Besides, 85 more such buses (of both Ashok Leyland and Tata Motors make) will hit the road in July. It will be a sizeable AC fleet that would help commuters to beat the heat," transport minister Madan Mitra said.

So far, a majority of Volvo buses - each priced at Rs 1.01 crore - bought under the first JNNURM scheme in 2009 are still being run by private franchises. "Under the JNNURM scheme, 874 AC and non-AC buses will be bought in all. Out of these, 632 buses will ply in Kolkata, 80 in Siliguri, 60 in Jalpaiguri, 60 in Asansol and 42 in Durgapur. All these buses will be run by state transport undertakings (STUs)," said principal secretary (Transport) Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

While CSTC will run 632 buses, North Bengal State Transport Corporation (NBSTC) will run 140 buses and South Bengal State Transport Corporation (SBSTC) will run 102 buses. The state government has also finalized the sanction of 210 new buses for 19 routes. "These permits were issued after a thorough scrutiny," he added.

The state government has decided to start 19 new private bus routes, which would potentially accommodate 385 buses and reduce commuters' dependence on autos. To make the buses more energy efficient, the STUs would replace the lamps of the buses with LEDs. These would be cost-efficient as well.
