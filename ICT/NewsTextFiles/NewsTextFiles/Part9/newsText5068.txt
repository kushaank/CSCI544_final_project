
Former Baywatch actress, Pamela Anderson, on Friday revealed she was gang-raped by her first boyfriend and his friends, and was sexually molested by her babysitter when she was six-years old.

The star was speaking at the launch of her animal charity in Cannes, France.

“I feel now might be the time to reveal a few of my most painful memories. At the risk of over-exposing myself, again, or being inappropriate, again, I thought I might share with you why I am doing this,” said Anderson.

“I went to her boyfriend’s house and his older brother decided to teach me backgammon, which led into a back massage, which led into rape – my first sexual experience. He was 25 years old and I was 12,” she added.

Anderson then went on to describe how she was gang-raped by her first boyfriend and six of his friends, and wanted to commit suicide afterwards.

“My affinity with animals saved me. It came to me naturally. The trees spoke to me. My loyalty was with the animal kingdom and I vowed to protect them and only them.
