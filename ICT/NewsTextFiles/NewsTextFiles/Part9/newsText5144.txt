
The Grande Prairie Fire Department is helping to fight fires more than 5,000 kilometres away from the Swan City.

The group went to the island in order to expand their own training ability – an essential part of their job – by working with Honduran fire departments, bringing them up to speed on modern firefighting technique.

The Grande Prairians went down to help local firefighters with their basic skills. Meanwhile, their families and Rotarian Dick French helped out at local schools; refurbishing desks and providing basic medical treatment at orphanages.

Haughian said the state of the small islands are often dire. “They don’t like to be called a third world country but I mean, they’re not that much better off. Some of their communities, they can’t get to by road so when the have a fire, it’s tragic, right? The fire goes until it goes out,” he said.

One solution was the donation of a floating pump, funded by the Swan City Rotary – something local crews use regularly for forest fires – and lessons for the Hondurans on how to use it. The Grande Prairie Rotary Club paid airfare for three of the participants.

Haughian said their work paid immediate dividends.

The Rotary and the fire department plan to return to the island annually, and will start fundraising for next year’s expedition shortly.
