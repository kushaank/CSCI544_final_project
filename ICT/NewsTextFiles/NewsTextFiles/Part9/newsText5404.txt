
The Kataeb Party on Monday called for declaring a “parliamentary state of emergency,” urging the legislature to hold successive rounds of voting to elect a new president before the May 25 deadline passes.

“In the last few days that separate us from the end of the constitutional timeframe to elect a new president of the republic, the Kataeb Party cannot but raise the voice to demand respect for the constitution,” said a statement issued after the weekly meeting of the party's politburo.

Kataeb warned that “history will not be merciful” towards anyone impeding the election of a new president.

In an interview with the pan-Arab daily Asharq al-Awsat, Kataeb leader Amin Gemayel said he will only run for office if both political camps endorse him as a “consensual” candidate.

The first four rounds of the polls failed to bring a head of state to the country's top Christian post after most of the March 8 camp's MPs boycotted the elections.

The March 8 alliance's members have claimed that their boycott was the result of lack of agreement on a consensual candidate.

A fifth round of elections is scheduled to take place on Thursday. March 8 MPs have informed Speaker Nabih Berri that they would attend the session but it is not clear whether they would vote or not.

Tensions were high on Sunday in the aforementioned area in the wake of a major brawl between residents and Kurd and Syrian workers who reside there.

Kataeb also called for devising “an urgent plan to organize the presence of Syrian refugees” in Lebanon.
