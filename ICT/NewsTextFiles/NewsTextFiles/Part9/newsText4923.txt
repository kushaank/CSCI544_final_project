
Federal Minister for Railways Khawaja Saad Rafique said on Monday that the engine shed facility had been revived so that the new locomotives imported from China could be properly maintained. Rafique was talking to the media at the reopening of the engine sheds, which had been constructed in 1968-69 but shut down in 2009 due to scarcity of funds.

As many as 14 locomotives equipped with modern technology have been included to make the railways profitable, Rafique said. He said the new locomotives were being added to the fleet after around years. The minister said that in the past locomotives had been imported but were not handled properly.

The minister asked the authorities to install CCTV cameras and ensure proper lighting in the shed facility and a proper security system to eliminate pilferage.

Rafique said the railways officers were heroes who protected national assets in the larger interest of the department and the country. He urged the workers to show ownership of the locomotives and take care of them along with other PR assets. He also said he was aware of the workers’ problems, and facilities like new apartments and schools would be provided as the earning of the department increased.

Rafique said recruitment would take place purely on merit, and the PR had signed a contract with National Testing Service in this regard.
