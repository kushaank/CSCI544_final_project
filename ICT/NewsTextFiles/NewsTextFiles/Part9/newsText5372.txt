
GEORGE TOWN: The allegation by a Bukit Gelugor by-election independent candidate that Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng had secretly expressed his support for PAS’ hudud in Kelantan is a lie.

Lim’s political secretary Wong Hon Wai in a statement on Monday said that the Chief Minister has never supported PAS’ Private Members Bill to implement its brand of hudud in his capacity as DAP secretary-general.

"Mohamed Nabi Bux Mohd Nabi Abd Sathar’s allegation is mischievous and his candidacy should be rejected by the Election Commission,” he said.

On Sunday, Mohamed Nabi Bux, 63, claimed that Lim told a few PAS leaders that he was not against the implementation of PAS’ hudud in this country.

Meanwhile, a huge crowd turned up at a DAP ceramah in Air Itam on Sunday night to listen to Bukit Gelugor by-election candidate Ramkarpal Singh.

Ramkarpal told the crowd that he used to live in Air Itam till he was 10 and he also followed his father, the late Karpal Singh to campaign in the area.

He also thanked Ju Huat coffee shop owner, who was not present at the ceramah, for allowing him to use the premises for press conferences as what his father had done should he win the by-election.

Please wait.
