
BAUCHI - Bauchi State Government has called for collaboration between it and the newsmen to ensure adequate coverage of activities in the state.

The state’s newly appointed Commissioner for Information, Alhaji Salihu Halilu, made the call in Bauchi on Thursday when he led senior staff of the ministry on a visit to the Bauchi Zonal Office of the agency.

Halilu said that such partnership would help in publicising government activities, as well as  enlightening the populace.

“We want to appreciate your effort in covering our activities; I particularly want to say that your fair coverage has been outstanding.

“I am therefore soliciting for more of such support in covering our activities, to enlighten and educate our people, with a view to having a more informed society.

“We had tremendous support from News Agency of Nigeria. We believe that NAN can help us disseminate our activities, as well as the efforts this administration is making to transform the society.

“As you are also aware, 2015 general election is around the corner and very soon, campaign will commence and primaries would be conducted before the election proper.

“Your input is very vital for the successful conduct of the election, “he said.

Responding, the NAN Bauchi Zonal Manger, Malam Abdullahi Salihu, thanked the commissioner for the confidence in NAN, and assured them of the support of the agency.

“With about 300 subscribers, made up of Print and Electronic media, and offices established within and outside Nigeria, NAN has a fairly wide coverage area.

“We shall do all that we can, within the confines of ethics, to discharge our responsibilities to the government and people of the state.

“All we need is the co’ operation of government officials, some of whom do not operate open door policy.

“I therefore urge the Bauchi State Ministry of Information, to sensitise public servants to be forthcoming with information when requested.
