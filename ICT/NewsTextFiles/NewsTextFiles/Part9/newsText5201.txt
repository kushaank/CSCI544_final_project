
CHINESE corruption charges against British drug maker GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) executives could be the start of the pharmaceutical industry’s problems in its biggest emerging drugs market, say industry sources in China.

The charges relating to GSK executives, accused of funnelling hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to doctors and health officials via travel agencies, were announced by Chinese authorities last week, the culmination of a 10-month police investigation.

But the GSK case is unlikely to represent closure for the drugs industry in China, which is set to become the world’s second-biggest pharmaceutical market behind the US within three years according to consultancy IMS Health.

Drug firm executives, sales staff, lawyers and compliance experts say China’s crackdown on drug makers and healthcare firms is intensifying as prosecutors grow bolder in the wake of the GSK case, threatening to stymie the growth of firms caught in the crosshairs of the corruption crackdown.

"The investigation against GSK may be coming to a close, but these types of probes in the pharmaceutical sector are becoming a weekly occurrence," a sales rep for the Chinese unit of a major global drug maker says. He requested his name and his firm’s name be withheld due to the sensitivity of the topic.

After a series of probes against foreign drug makers last year, a range of government bodies, including the state planning agency, local commerce bureaus and the health ministry are making frequent, sometimes unannounced spot-checks at foreign healthcare firms, risk consultants say.

Lawyers estimate that more than half of all drug makers operating in China are being investigated in some capacity, from large multinational firms to Chinese state-owned enterprises.

The effect of a probe can be significant. GSK’s revenues in China plunged 61% in the third quarter last year and were still down 20% in the first quarter of this year from a year earlier.

Official Chinese media said on Friday that the firm might have suffered "irreparable damage" in the Chinese market. Legal sources and one source with direct knowledge of the GSK probe say China’s authorities may still try to charge the company itself, which could potentially put GSK’s business licences to operate in China at risk.

GSK said in a statement last Wednesday that the firm wanted "to reach a resolution that will enable the company to continue to make an important contribution to the health and welfare of China and its citizens".

Chinese authorities, led by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce and the country’s public security bureau, are ramping up their visits to foreign drug firms.

"We have certainly been made aware from clients that inspection visits by various government agencies have increased and these visits are now more focused," Shanghai-based FTI Consulting MD Bob Youill says.

Authorities are looking to unearth proof that firms have violated anticorruption laws or artificially inflated drug prices, a sensitive theme as China’s leaders look to provide affordable healthcare to the country’s near-1.4-billion people.

Last year, authorities visited large international drugs manufacturers including Novartis, AstraZeneca, Sanofi, Eli Lilly and Bayer as part of a broad investigation into the sector.

Bayer says its contacts with regulators were within the normal range. Johnson & Johnson spokesman Ernie Knewitz says he is unaware of any "new developments" in China.

Chinese subsidiaries of US drug maker Merck "have received and may continue to receive inquiries regarding their operations from various Chinese governmental agencies", Merck spokesman Steven Cragle says.

Pfizer says it regularly interacts with government and regulatory agencies in China "to discuss a variety of issues, including patient access, regulatory and compliance matters, and anticounterfeiting measures".

Roche Holding says it has not been contacted or investigated by Chinese authorities over allegations of corruption, while a Novartis spokeswoman says she is not aware of any contact from authorities around corruption.

Chinese police charged GSK’s former China boss, Briton Mark Reilly, and two other colleagues with corruption last Wednesday after the probe found the firm had made billions of yuan from bribing doctors and hospitals.
