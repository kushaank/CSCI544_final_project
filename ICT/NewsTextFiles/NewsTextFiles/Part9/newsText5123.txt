Skaneateles, NY -- Voters will be asked to approve a capital project and elect two members to the Skaneateles School Board in balloting today.

Coville.

Voting takes place from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. in the auditorium of Waterman Primary School.

Voters will also be asked to approve a $30.1 million budget for 2014-2015, which represents a 0.5 percent increase over the current budget of $30 million. The budget will require a 1.6 percent increase in the tax levy.

At the same time, voters will be asked to approve a $2 million plan to repair schools and replace equipment. The proposed capital project, which the district is calling Phase II, would replace a boiler, pipes, a public address system and stage curtains.It would also upgrade school security by expanding the district's surveillance cameras.

Repairs would also be made to the roof on the south wing of the Waterman Primary School where a 20-foot-gash was discovered this week. The roof had been slated for repair in a year or two, but this winter's severe weather caused the brittle membrane to break, Bates said. A temporary repair has been made and voters will be asked approve permanent repairs.

The capital improvements would add $5 to the tax bill for a $100,000 home beginning in the 2016-17 school year.
