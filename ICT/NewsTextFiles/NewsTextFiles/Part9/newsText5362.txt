
Foreign ministers from Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador as well as an envoy from the Vatican met with members of Venezuela’s Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD) opposition coalition on Monday in an attempt to persuade them to rejoin talks with the government of president Nicolás Maduro. MUD leaders had announced last week that they were dropping out of negotiations over several key points due to the government’s refusal to cede ground. On Monday, the coalition presented the ambassadors with a list of demands.

Another demand consists of the inclusion of student opposition sectors in dialogue, MUD secretary Ramón Guillermo Aveledo told El Universal. “From day one, we said that the students represent themselves and we took the opportunity to ask the government to receive them, to listen to them, and that still hasn’t happened. Has that helped bring the protests to an end? No, it has not … the path of repression has failed, [the government] has to examine a different route,” he said.
