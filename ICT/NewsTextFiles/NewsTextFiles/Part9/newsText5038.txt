
China's commerce minister, Gao Hucheng, on Saturday strongly condemned the recent violent attacks against Chinese nationals and companies in Vietnam and urged Hanoi to improve the country's trade and investment environment.

Two Chinese nationals have been confirmed to be killed and more than 100 others injured in the violence as protests over a South China Sea dispute spread from southern to central Vietnam.

Gao also made solemn representations to Vietnam in a meeting with the country's minister of Industry and Trade Vu Huy Hoang on the sidelines of a ministerial meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) held in Qingdao in eastern China's Shandong province.

He urged the Vietnamese authorities to "bring relevant issues under control" and create a favorable environment for trade and investment.

The APEC meeting, scheduled from May 17-18, brought together trade ministers from the 21 APEC member economies.
