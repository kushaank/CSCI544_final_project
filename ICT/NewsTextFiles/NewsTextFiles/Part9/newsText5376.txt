
CAPE TOWN - The Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism on Monday said it wants to correct the idea that people have concerning their alleged ambitions of destroying the multi-billion rand trout industry.

Trout has been labelled as an invasive or alien species by government because it could potentially have damaging long-term effects.

The departmentâ€™s Guy Preston says the lobby group is misinformed of the government's intentions.
