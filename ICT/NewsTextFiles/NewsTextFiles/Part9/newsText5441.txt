Hit-and-run crashes are rising in North Carolina at what AAA calls an alarming rate.

Every day, the state averages almost five accidents in which someone is injured or killed, and the driver leaves the scene, according to the car club.

In Gaston, hit-and-run crashes have also been on the rise, although the increase is not drastic, law enforcement officers say.

North Carolina Highway Patrol investigated 15 more of the crashes here last year than three years ago. Gastonia Police have also seen numbers rise slightly since 2010.

Gaston has been among the state’s top 20 counties for hit-and-run crashes over the last four years.

In neighboring Charlotte, such crashes increased by 13 percent between 2012 and 2013.

Statewide, they have gone up 5.7 percent.

Face to the crime: Gaston has seen several hit-and-run crashes in recent months. The most recent involved a truck and a cyclist.

The cyclist is recovering from her injuries after being hit by a passing vehicle whose driver didn’t stop to help. The woman was hit May 11 around 11 a.m. along Lower Armstrong Road in Belmont, according to N.C. Highway Patrol.

She was riding her bike along the south Belmont street when a truck carrying a boat hit her. Her injuries were not life-threatening, according to investigators.

Police have not been able to identify the driver who was responsible.

In April, 53-year-old John Wayne King was killed after two vehicles hit him. Neither driver stopped. One was eventually arrested and charged with second-degree murder in King’s death. Police have not located the second driver.

Tougher penalties a solution?: The problem, AAA maintains, is the lenient penalty for drivers charged with hit and run.

Currently, North Carolina law says a person convicted of killing someone and leaving the scene could spend three to five years in prison. For a person with no criminal record, a hit-and-run charge could end in probation.
