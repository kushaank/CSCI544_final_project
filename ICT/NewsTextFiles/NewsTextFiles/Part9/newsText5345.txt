
The Mayor of Torrevieja, Eduardo Dolón, has announced in a radio interview this week that the town hall will install public toilets in key areas of the city´s promenade. The councillor has said that the administration is in the process of compiling a tender document for the provision of the facility, which should be available shortly.

This is seen as good news all round, not only for the people who visit the beaches who have asked for toilets for some time, as the few which are provided are sparsely situated, but also for the many bus passengers and staff who have also complained that there were no toilets installed at the newly renovated bus station near the Eras de la Sal.

Moreover, the move is also seen as a positive one by the opposition PSOE group, but their praise is perhaps due to the fact that is was them who had already requested and proposed the installation of public toilets in April of 2013, although at that time the town hall ignored the request.
