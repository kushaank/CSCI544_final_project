
Jakarta. The Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the nation’s most powerful business lobby, is confident that newly appointed Coordinating Minister for the Economy Chairul Tanjung possesses all the necessary credits to act as the country’s chief economist, chairman Suryo Bambang Sulisto said.

“He is a successful businessman who understands both macro- and micro-economic issues very well,” said the chamber of commerce (Kadin) chief after Chairul’s inauguration in Jakarta on Monday.

The prominent businessman replaced National Mandate Party (PAN) member Hatta Rajasa, who gave up his position in order to run as presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto’s second in command.

Effectively, Chairul would only spend five months as the coordinating minister, during which he vowed to strengthen the country’s economic foundation for the next government, according to his acceptance speech.

Listed as the 18th wealthiest man in Indonesia, Chairul gained his footing in the country’s business world as chairman and co-founder of CT Corp, a major conglomerate with operations in the banking, insurance, retail and media sectors. Its many businesses include Trans TV, Trans 7, news portal Detik.com, Bank Mega, insurance company Asuransi Jiwa Mega Life a nd supermarket chain Carrefour.

The 51-year-old is no stranger to the government as he also heads the National Economics Committee (KEN), which advises the country’s leaders on matters relating to economic development.

KEN involves some high-profile Indonesians, including fellow businessmen Sandiaga Uno, Erwin Aksa, and Raden Pardede.
