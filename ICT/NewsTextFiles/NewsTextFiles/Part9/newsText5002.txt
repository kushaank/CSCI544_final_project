
PARIS — French telecom market leader Orange is in talks about a tie-up with Bouygues Telecom, France’s economy minister said on Friday after two sources said the discussions could lead to Orange acquiring its smaller rival.

The talks bring Orange, the former France Telecom monopoly, into the frame for the first time in moves to consolidate the industry, but other industry sources wondered how far talks could go between the biggest and third-biggest mobile service providers, given the likely antitrust hurdles. They said the manoeuvring could be aimed instead at raising the potential price of Bouygues Telecom for rival Iliad, whose upstart "Free" mobile service sparked a price war two years ago.

Stephane Richard, CEO of 27% state-owned Orange, has discussed the matter with Martin Bouygues, his counterpart at Bouygues, the sources said.

A deal with Orange would value Bouygues Telecom at more than €6bn, and by selling in return for shares, Bouygues and its shareholder JCDecaux could end up holding close to 10% of Orange, one of the sources said.

Bouygues Telecom and its conglomerate parent Bouygues were the losers last month in a battle to buy Vivendi’s SFR, the country’s second-biggest mobile network operator behind Orange.

Asked in a television interview about reports of the talks, French Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg said "they exist" but that there were "multiple discussions" taking place in the industry. Orange also said it was "exploring opportunities" and favoured consolidation.

Mr Montebourg has said the government wants to reduce to three from four the number of telecom players as tough competition in the sector is hurting jobs and investment in high-speed broadband. "We need to rebuild a telecoms sector that is in ruins," Mr Montebourg told BFMTV on Friday. He has also said Bouygues Telecom should explore tie-ups with other operators.

"It’s clear the sector will need to move one way or another, either via tie-ups or by network-sharing deals. But will that involve Orange, Free, Numericable?" said one source with knowledge of the wide-ranging discussions.

"Bouygues wants to create an auction here. The government, via Orange, wants to show it has a hand in this, and Iliad wants to get hold of Bouygues Telecom’s network," said a Paris-based trader.
