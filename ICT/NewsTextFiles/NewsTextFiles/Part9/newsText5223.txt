
NEW DELHI: The long queue at Gujarat Bhawan to meet prime minister-designate Narendra Modi on Monday began at 10 am with senior party leader Arun Jaitley who was followed by Modi's close aide Amit Shah about 10 minutes later. The three held an over hour-long meeting on the shape of the government.

While the meeting between the three leaders was on, newly-elected MP from Gonda in Uttar Pradesh Brijbhushan Sharan Singh landed up at Gujarat Bhawan but was turned back as Modi could not meet him.

Around 12 noon, former UP chief minister Kalyan Singh came with his son Rajvir Singh and soon after he left, senior party leader Sushma Swaraj called on Modi, and was locked in meeting with him for about 45 minutes.

Around 1.15 pm, actor and Chandigarh MP Kirron Kher's husband Anupam Kher showed up. While on his way out after a brief courtesy call, Kher displayed his photograph with Modi taken on his phone to mediapersons present at the gates. Soon after, it was the turn of actor-turned-politician Vinod Khanna, who was elected from Gurdaspur.

At 2 pm arrived MDMK leader Vaiko for a meeting that lasted about half-an-hour. He was followed by YSR Congress leader Jaganmohan Reddy.

At 4.30 pm, Union home secretary Anil Goswami was seen going in. Modi did not move out of Gujarat Bhawan and will reach Parliament House at 11.45 am on Tuesday for a meeting of the BJP parliamentary party, where he will be formally elected as the leader of the legislative party.

NDA leaders will join the meeting soon after and hand over their letters of support for Modi. After lunch at Parliament House with all the MPs, Modi plans to leave for Rashtrapati Bhavan to meet President Pranab Mukherjee and stake claim to form government.
