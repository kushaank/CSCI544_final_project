
German drivers appear to prefer the roar of combustible engines than the quiet humming of electric cars despite the country's leading position as a major producer of e-vehicles.

While Germany remains a leading maker of electric cars, it ranks among the lowest when it comes to its citizens actually driving e-vehicles.

Only 2,800 electric cars were sold in Germany in the fourth quarter of 2013, according to a report by German business weekly WirtschaftsWoche and McKinsey.

The figure places Germany, along with China, in last place among the world's major car producing countries. In France, manufacturers sold almost twice as many electric cars while in United States it was nearly 30,000.

According to the report, more than 400,000 electric cars have sold worldwide since 2009. Germany accounted for only about 5% of that figure. Nevertheless, WirtschaftsWoche and McKinsey list Germany on par with Japan and the U.S. as a leading producer of electric cars. In five years, Germany is expected to have 440,000 electric cars a year rolling off the production line, behind Japan, with a forecasted 450,000 e-vehicles a year and ahead of the U.S., which is expected to produce around 360,000 a year, and China, with 290,000.

Germany only looks good as a producer of evs if you lump hybrids in with all-electric cars. Hybrids are the conservative, evolutionary option, allowing car companies to change slowly. Rapid progress in batteries means IMHO that this plan is an illusion. Once Nissan/Renault get the Leaf's range up to 200km, and drivers can find chargers at any motorway service station, the extra weight, complexity and cost of hybrids will become a crippling disadvantage. There's big trouble ahead for German carmakers if they don't move faster.
