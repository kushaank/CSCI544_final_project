
Authorities say a 3-year-old boy has died after being pulled from a pool in Mesa Saturday afternoon.

The incident happened around 2:15 at a home near McDowell and Power Roads.

Mesa Fire Department Captain Craig Chenery said the boy was attending a birthday party at the home and when adults did a head count, they noticed he was missing.

Chenery said party-goers found the boy in the backyard pool and immediately pulled him out and started performing CPR.

When fire crews arrived they transported the boy to Banner Baywood Medical Center where he later died.

Chenery said the home did have a pool fence, so it is unclear at this time how the boy made his way to the pool.
