
An Agbarho Customary Court in Ughelli-North Local Government Area, Delta, on Monday dissolved a 29-year-old marriage between a former Minister of Science and Technology, Grace Ekpiwhre and Peter.

The President of the court, Mrs Stella Okah, in her judgment, held that the court was convinced “beyond all reasonable doubt’’ that love was no longer existing between the couple.

Okah, supported by other members of the court, ordered the family of the minister to refund the bride price paid by her husband to the court’s registry.

Grace had approached the court to dissolve the marriage to Ekpiwhre claiming that she was no longer interested in the marriage which produced a daughter.

She told the court that Ekpiwhre, in 1985, paid N120 as her bride price according to the customs of the area.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that after the judgment, the minister’s family led by Samuel Salubi, refunded the bride price to the Ekpiwhre’s family.
