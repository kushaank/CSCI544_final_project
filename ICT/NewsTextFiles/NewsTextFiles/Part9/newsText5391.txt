
Additional Attorney General MK Rahman has been relieved of his duties.

The law ministry issued a circular in this regard on  Monday.

Rahman has also been working as the prosecution coordinator in  the war crimes trial.

The circular, however, did not say anything about  his responsibilities at the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT).

The  secretary-in-charge at the law ministry, Syed Aminul Islam, said that the law  minister, who is abroad now, will clear the issue on his return.

He,  however, expressed his 'personal' opinion over the issue while speaking to  bdnews24.com on Monday.

"The responsibility of coordinating the  tribunal's prosecution team was given as an additional duty. Since he does not  have his original designation, so he will no more continue as the coordinator," said Islam.

Law Minister Anisul Huq left Dhaka for the UK on Monday  morning. He is accompanied by secretary Abu Saleh Sheikh Md Jahirul Haque. They  are expected to return on May 28.

Attorney General Mahbubey Alam told  bdnews24.com that it was the government's matter to decide whether MK Rahman  will continue to work as the prosecutions' coordinator.

On Jan 30 last  year, Rahman was handed the responsibility to coordinate the ICT's prosecution  team.
