
SHERMAN OAKS (CBSLA.com)  —  Authorities said they had to coax a naked man out of the crawlspace of a Sherman Oaks apartment building Sunday morning.

The man was taken to an area hospital by firefighters for observation.

Urban Search & Rescue personnel were summoned to the 12900 block of Dickens Street by the LAPD around 10:45 a.m.

The man was coaxed out and taken to a hospital by ambulance with police on board as a precaution, Brian Humphrey of the Los Angeles Fire Department said.

The man appeared to be in his mid-20s, according to broadcast reports.

It was unclear how long the man was staying under the crawlspace or if he is a resident of the neighborhood.

Residents called police after allegedly observing the man walking around their neighborhood nude.
