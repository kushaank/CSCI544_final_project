
Engineers and geologists were hopeful dryer weather over the last few days would allow the bluff to stabilize, but over the weekend the sensor sent an alert indicating additional earth movement at the site.  The additional 1/2 inch over the weekend adds to 2.25 inches of total vertical and horizontal movement last week.

While an earlier assessment indicated a collapse of the approach spans is not likely to impact the main truss over the river navigation channel, engineers and geologists continue to monitor the bluff for additional soil movement. Highway traffic was moved off the Old Ledbetter Bridge last July when the New Ledbetter Bridge opened to traffic, so the main concern about the old structure is the threat to river traffic.  The main river navigation span has been deemed safe for boats passing under it.

The Old Ledbetter Bridge opened to traffic in 1931.  It was restricted to a 3-ton load limit in January 2012 while the new bridge was under construction just upstream.  KYTC officials expedited construction of the new bridge and it opened to traffic on July 31, 2013, eleven months ahead of schedule.
