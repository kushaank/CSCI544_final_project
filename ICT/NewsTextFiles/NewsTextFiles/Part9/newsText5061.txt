
Health Minister U T Khader on Monday said the Congress in the State has received a setback in the recently-held parliamentary elections as it could not stop the Modi wave.

Speaking to reporters after meeting Chief Minister Siddaramaiah at his official residence Cauvery, he said the party’s Janardhana Poojary was a good candidate in Mangalore. “We all wanted him (Poojary) to become the MP and we worked hard for his victory. But Modi wave worked in favour of the BJP,” he added.

Khader is perhaps the first minister in the State to openly say that there was a Modi wave in the State and that the ruling Congress was unable to stop it. Though another senior Cabinet minister also said that there was Modi wave, he refused to be quoted. Khader further said that the BJP has projected Modi as the antidote for all the ills of the nation.

The State government led by Siddaramaiah has done a lot of good work in the last one year. But it appears that people’s memory is short and they have forgotten about them all, he added.
