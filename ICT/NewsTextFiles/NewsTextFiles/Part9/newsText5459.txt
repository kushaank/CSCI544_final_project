
Police are cracking down on drunken passengers at Gatwick, patrolling the airport's pubs and bars in a bid to stop intoxicated fliers from causing air rage incidents.

Sussex Police have asked the pubs at Gatwick not to serve people who appear drunk and have stepped up patrols in the airport in a bid to keep drunken passengers under control.

Since the initiative began, the force reported a 'significant reduction' in alcohol-fuelled incidents.

During the trial, which began last year, police asked staff in pubs and Duty Free not to sell to anyone who appeared drunk and encouraged airline workers to ask for assistance if they thought passengers were intoxicated.

Jane Goodchild, a training and support office for Monarch Airlines, came up with the idea for the trial.

The former cabin crew member wanted to tackle anti-social behaviour at the airport and on board flights.

‘We wanted to ensure that every passenger has the most pleasant experience possible.

Jean Irving, Sussex Police's licensing and public safety manager, said: ‘Since we have begun working with our partners the problem has reduced considerably.

‘At the root of it all has been working in partnership with airport staff and businesses to raise awareness around alcohol consumption and flying, with the focus very much being on responsible drinking.

Sussex Police has now been invited to discuss the results of the trial at an international conference on aviation safety.
