
MUSCAT: An Omani court has sentenced a former minister to three years in jail over graft charges, in a first for the Gulf sultanate which has vowed to combat corruption, newspapers reported Monday.

They said ex-commerce minister Mohammed bin Nasser al-Khusaibi was found guilty of bribing another official to award a contract linked to a Muscat airport expansion project to a company in which he was a shareholder.

The Muscat court on Sunday also slapped Khusaibi with a hefty 800,000-riyal ($2-million) fine, the Oman Daily Observer said.

An accomplice, a former undersecretary at the transport and telecommunications ministry, was handed the same jail term and fined.

The general manager of the company, a non-Omani Arab national, was sentenced to six months in jail, to be followed by deportation.

The Observer said a former refinery CEO who is also a member of Oman's upper chamber had been sentenced to three years in jail for corruption in an earlier trial.

But Khusaibi was the first former government member to be handed a jail term.

A businessman has also been jailed for 18 years over several corruption cases, while an ex-chief for ports at the transport ministry received a three-year sentence, said the daily.

It did not specify when the earlier sentences were handed down, but said they were part of a government drive to "maintain transparency".

The normally sleepy sultanate was caught up in the 2011 Arab Spring, with demonstrators taking to the streets to demand improved living conditions and reforms.

A key demand of the protests, which degenerated into clashes with security forces in which two demonstrators were killed, was the sacking of ministers accused of corruption.
