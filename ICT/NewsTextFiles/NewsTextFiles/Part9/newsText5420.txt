
The mining tragedy in Soma, Turkey was horrendous.  301 miners lie dead in a cold, dark grave.  What did the government do?  The Turkish PM went to Soma, insulted those in grief, and then slapped around a young man who happened to object to the PM's rudeness.  As a follow-up, the government has the city on lock down to stop anti government protests.    Managing the public protests is essential for the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). AKP relaxed regulations and fast tracked accommodations to the mining industry. Safety suffered and the Soma mine explosion did the rest.  PM Erdogan, President Gul, and the AKP hierarchy deserve a fair trial and very long jail sentences for this outrage.
