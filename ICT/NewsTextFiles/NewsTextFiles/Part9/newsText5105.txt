
The first preparatory meeting for the national conference on economic and trade affairs was held May 18 in Taipei City, underscoring the ROC government’s commitment to fast-tracking participation in regional integration.

Co-chaired by Premier Jiang Yi-huah and former Vice Premier Lin Hsin-yi, the event was attended by senior officials and representatives from the academic, civic and private sectors.

Scheduled for late July, the conference will serve as a platform for nationwide participation on Taiwan’s growth strategies in the increasingly globalized business environment, Jiang said.

The government is absolutely open to all opinions and views in this regard, and welcomes input from all segments of society. It is important that a consensus on Taiwan’s future economic development is formed, he added.

While polls indicate that most ROC nationals support the country’s bid for membership in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, Jiang said there are concerns over Taiwan’s preparedness, including the competitiveness of at-risk sectors.

The premier said cross-strait relations will also be a subject of discussion at the conference as they are key in Taiwan’s efforts for greater participation in the TPP and RCEP.

According to cabinet spokesman Sun Lih-chyun, participants in the preparatory meeting agree that the conference should focus on cross-strait trade exchanges. This makes sense given Taiwan seeks an expanded role in regional integration, as well as economic efficiency and fair allocation of economic benefits, he said.

Participants also urged the government to look at ways of including more opinions from different groups in the conference, Sun added.
