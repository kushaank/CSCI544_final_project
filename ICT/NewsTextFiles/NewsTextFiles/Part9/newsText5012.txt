
NEW DELHI: The possibility of early polls may be a talking point but lieutenant governor  Najeeb Jung wants to wait and watch. He will review the status quo and form a view on Delhi's readiness for fresh polls only after government formation at the Centre. He might also submit a report to the home ministry.

The LG had earlier indicated that he would review the political situation in Delhi—under the President's rule since Arvind Kejriwal resigned as chief minister in February—after the Lok Sabha results.

While Jung went about his business on Monday, top sources in the LG office explained the road ahead. After the central government takes charge, the LG can use his discretion to call upon BJP, the largest party in the assembly with 31 MLAs, to prove its majority and form the government. BJP has the support of one  Akali Dal MLA. Once the LG is satisfied that a government cannot be formed, he will send a report to the Centre, which will then take a call. When the LG would meets the new Prime Minister Narendra Modi , he is expected to update him on Delhi's situation.

The Supreme Court had clarified on April 17 that the LG was free to revoke the decision to keep the assembly in suspended animation, though the proclamation said the President's rule would stay for a year.

On the first working day after the Lok Sabha results were declared on May 16, BJP reiterated that it was open to fresh polls. Congress, meanwhile, denied reports that it had offered Aam Aadmi Party outside support in Delhi. "I saying it clearly that Congress is ready for polls if they are announced," said DPCC chief Arvinder Singh.

AAP, however, is keen on early elections. It has lost all the seven Lok Sabha seats and its base among the middle class has been dented. The party, however, continues to enjoy the support of the poor and has attracted a good share of Muslim votes. It hopes the tide to once again turn in the favour of Kejriwal, who will be chief ministerial candidate.
