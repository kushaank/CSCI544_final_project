
IT’S all to play for.

A mass poll conducted by the Daily Echo shows that with the local elections just days away, many residents in Hampshire still haven’t made up their minds about who to vote for.

And the survey, carried out in four areas of the county over the past week, also shows that UKIP are enjoying a surge in popularity ahead of Thursday’s elections.

Residents in Southampton , Eastleigh , Winchester and Fareham will all elect councillors, while European elections are also taking place on the same day.

We spoke to 1,000 people, spread across all four authorities, to see how they were voting.

Just over a tenth of people asked were not even aware that elections were taking place, but 691 of those asked said they would be voting, while 73 said they were undecided.

However there is likely to be a low turnout this week, with the last city council elections in Southampton in 2012 producing a turnout of 30.5 per cent and Eastleigh returning one of 35.46 per cent.

Our poll results also show that many votes are still there to be fought for, with 161 of the 691 people saying they will definitely vote yet to make up their mind.

Across the four councils, UKIP came second only to the Conservatives in terms of who residents say they will vote for, with 126 people saying they would choose the party.

Breaking it down for each authority, they came second to Labour in Southampton and the Liberal Democrats in Eastleigh.

Many voters told the Daily Echo they would vote for UKIP council candidates because of the UK’s place in Europe, and the impact of immigration.

And one senior Labour councillor in Southampton told the Echo: “A lot of people are telling us they are considering voting for UKIP over us and the other parties because of Europe.

Two years after seizing control of the city council in Southampton and in spite of passing unpopular service cuts, our poll shows the party has retained support among some residents.

Of the 400 people polled in the city, 62 said they would be voting Labour, in comparison to 52 for UKIP and 48 for the Conservatives, who Labour replaced.

The Liberal Democrats topped our poll in Eastleigh, where the party has been in power since 1994.

Of the 200 people asked, 36 said they would choose the Lib Dems, while 33 picked UKIP in a town which has been targeted by the Eurosceptic party in recent years.

The balance of power is finely poised in Winchester, with both the minority Conservative administration and Lib Dems having 27 seats.

And with ten Conservative seats and nine Lib Dem wards up for grabs at the election, the contest is too close to call.

That is borne out in our poll, which shows that 35 of 200 people asked in the city would currently choose the Tories as opposed to 29 for the Lib Dems, while 45 residents are still undecided.

The picture is more clear cut in Fareham, where the Conservatives currently have 23 seats to the Liberal Democrats’ six and Independents’ two.

That status quo looks unlikely to change according to our poll, in which 67 of the 200 people questioned said they would vote Tory, more than 40 votes ahead of the Lib Dems in second.

Dr Mark Farwell, a senior lecturer in political sociology at Southampton Solent University , said: “There is a precedent of people in Britain voting on a split ticket, one party for European elections and another for local elections.

“UKIP is strong in Europe but doesn’t have a track record in local government, but I’m not surprised they polled well on local elections as their platformissue, immigration, is highly emotive.

Just be sure to make the effort to vote. Even if you couldn't care less, still pick the one you like best. It's one of the few rights we have, make the most and have your say.

Good luck to all.

Could it be that the TUSC have got rid of the bumbling failure that stood in Redbridge last time? He must have cost them votes.

An independent survey will be carried out on May 22nd but I'm not confident that certain losers will accept the outcome.

The past few years have proved one thing, the current Council has been a shambles, the leader went and so did Councillors due to a few porky pies.

I've said before Royston is no angel, but he was honest with the electorate. He may have stood on some toes, but at least it was all in the open.

I don't believe in trying to persuade people to make a choice, i'd rather everyone make their own mind up.

I just feel everyone should use their right to vote and remember what has happened over the past few years.

Ask yourself, what has, or can , UKIP do for you?!

Ask yourself, what has, or can, Labour do for you?!

The answer on both cases is unprintable!

I urge all in BARGATE WARD to vote out the LABOUR COIUCILLORS. They are doing nothing in our ward, just taking money and not acting on any issues in Golden Grove and surrounding areas. UKIP will do for me this time around they can do NO worse than others who do nothing.

It's great you are voting UKIP, but trying to persuade others to vote for them without telling us what they can do isn't right.

People need to research, we are often fast to complain when things aren't going well, but we do have the right to vote.

I would guess most people who moan about the Council never vote.

Quite Agree Iron Lady, after the complete shambles and dishonesty from Labour, not to mention Asa Thorpe & Wife labelling us Cretins,Inbreds and Bigots I certainly will NOT be voting them. They lost my whole families votes due to the disgusting way they treated my dad after 42 years excellent service he gave to the Bereaved Families of Southampton. I Also know alot of my campaign supporters won't be either and there were over 3,000 supporters.

Having dealt with cases of people in the past I can confirm that your last sentence is fairly accurate.

Yes I agree with you that for the sake of saving our democracy people must vote, otherwise gates will open for undesirables.

If you don't approve of any candidates write None of these on the ballot paper. Pity they do not provide that choice as standrad practice.

I know who I will vote for Council election it will be for re-electing Cllr. Keith Morrell, hope others in Coxford will as well, but must respect the democratic rights of others to decide for themselves.

For European election? I was  always been against the EEC that became EU and is heading towards becoming USE (United States of Europe) but certainly will not be voting for UKIP whose MEPs kept on pocketing high salaries and allowances but hardly ever turned up to vote, in toothless European Parliament. Will it be Greens or some Socialists, who at least had sent me their manifesto, not once but twice, which in fact says absolutely nothing about either EU or even Europe????? Or may be None of These.

Ask yourself, what has, or can , UKIP do for you?!

Ask yourself, what has, or can, Labour do for you?!

Southy has a history of making statements based on zero facts so take it or leave it. UKIP will do well in the European elections but if you have strong views on immigration then there are better anti European parties to vote for. As for the local elections Labour are ruining the city centre so would take any alternative to them.

The Lib Dems in Eastleigh and the Tory's in Fareham are doing a much better job in those constituencies in my view. I have a strong desire to move out of the centre at the moment.

We're sick to death of being colonised and having a "government" taking its orders from Tel Aviv, Brussels and Washington - Vote UKIP, you know it makes sense.

That is all!

I Also know alot of my campaign supporters won't be either and there were over 3,000 supporters.

This is what Labour as done to it self, IronLady, It was only the TUSC, SP, SWP that help out where they could for Lisa Whitemore and it was noted at the time who the political groups was.

To many people still remember what the Tory,s done still its not been forgotten like George4th hopes it as been.

Labour still worried in the Redbridge ward as well as in Coxford ward and its going to be down to the Union Votes, will Union members will they deify its area Exe and give the Labour party some thing to remember about or will they do as they are told again and vote Labour, also will Lisa Whitemore contact all of its supporters and ask them to vote TUSC, and there are other campaigns thats happened over the last few years.

Last local election Labour only had Redbridge ward to worry about, now this year they have Coxford also and next year how many more wards will they need to worry about.

The last election was based on the Unions telling members to vote Labour as the Unions had a hatred for Royston as he stood up to them.

So, we had weeks of strikes, rubbish everywhere, yet still people lost jobs under Labour.

As for TUSC, I think you personally killed that idea!

For someone who has spent a political lifetime waiting for the Glorious Trotskyist Revolution; and seeing support for it decreasing decade by decade; it just shows the power this cult holds over southy that he can still brainwash himself to believe that his mob "truly represent the people".

Na your just Right wing Free, but then again what is it you accuse me off being, which show that you do not have a clear understanding of what is left or right or center,

When folk start saying you do not understand - listen to me I do! Problem with some of the minority parties who complain that if we listened to them we would support them. The evidence appears to be that most folk do not vote for them because they have listened.

Half of the Labour Voters in the Redbridge Ward could vote for the TUSC and still win the Redbridge Ward, there would be no fear here in the Redbridge Ward of letting the Tory's win this seat.

Look at the last Election result for the Redbridge Ward.

Half of the Labour voters could off voted TUSC and still kept the Tory's out of the Redbridge ward.

Redbridge is not the only ward like this.

When folk start saying you do not understand - listen to me I do! Problem with some of the minority parties who complain that if we listened to them we would support them. The evidence appears to be that most folk do not vote for them because they have listened.

oh, do stop bigging yourself and TUSC up.

You only got 220 votes from an electorate of over 10,000 because the overwhelming vast majority of people in Redbridge reject you.

It's absolutely nothing to do with fear, or the unions, or anything else.

It's because your policies are impractical, unwanted and, frankly, quite loony.

When 'the Tusc' is beaten by a comedian standing for 'Elvis loves Pets' the 'Beer, Baccy & Crumpet party' or the 'Monster Raving Loony Party' even the mildly retarded would recognise that 'the Tusc' is never going to be anything more than a joke. The candidates are the same angry old misfits who blame their personal failures on other peoples  success and want to tear society down in the name of 'fairness'. For the last half century and more they have morphed from the communists through to Militant Tendency and the Socialist Worker with the common theme of failure to change anything hung around their neck like a millstone. I think they bring a little colour and amusement in a trend that was  started by Screaming Lord Sutch and his Monster Raving Loony candidates.

I was looking for one for the Tory's and UKIP where it would not matter but there is not one.

Its only in Labour strong holds where it can be done and that comes down to 2 wards Redbridge where they can vote for TUSC and not worry about the Tory's and Coxford where they can vote for Independent (Councillor's against cuts) and not worry about the Tory's, So going on about splitting the Vote would not apply in these 2 wards, and to be saying it in these wards like is as been is just playing the fear card by the Labour Party.

Lots of could have, might have, even should have. they did not and fair bet they will not.

you are more likely to be right well more right than Torchie1 who can't tell the difference between local and national and euro.

Labour was playing the fear card last time round and they are doing it again, Tory,s do it as well Redbridge is not the only ward like this.[/p][/quote]oh, do stop bigging yourself and TUSC up. You only got 220 votes from an electorate of over 10,000 because the overwhelming vast majority of people in Redbridge reject you. It's absolutely nothing to do with fear, or the unions, or anything else. It's because your policies are impractical, unwanted and, frankly, quite loony.[/p][/quote]Did they or was it the fear card played that is played often by the major party's, and what,s up with you don't you want some else to give it a try the majors party's can't get things right and keep failing the people, they want change but keep getting oh you vote for them you let the other major win. And it was not rejection if it was the votes would of gone down for me and not up, its was going up because of the work I put in getting the message across in a small patch of an area at a time. Also the mass majority did not vote because they no longer believe in the political party,s and that,s the Majors party's that have done that to people again no rejection, just no faith in the political party's they think that they are all the same all out for what they can get for them self,s.[/p][/quote]With the deep political insight that you claim to have could you explain what threats were used by the 'Elvis loves Pets', 'Beer, Baccy & Crumpet' Party and the 'Monster Raving Loon'y Party to frighten the voters of Eastleigh away from voting for 'the Tusc' ? In the secrecy of the voting booth, it's just the voter with their slip and a pencil, no-one is forcing them to vote for any party that they don't want to and they clearly don't want to vote for 'the Tusc'.

No-one wants you, just accept it.[/p][/quote]And what as Eastleigh MP Constituency By-Election got to do with Redbridge Ward come to think about it What,s it got to do with Southampton Council Election Nothing You do realise the difference don't you 1 is national the other is local and have you ever look at a map to find out the location of Eastleigh to relation to Redbridge Southampton, Or is it where you really live and why you keep brining up Eastleigh, you also forget that the TUSC is new political group/party and is doing well for a new group maybe to well for your liking. The concept of comparing Eastleigh Financial belt in by-election to a working class area as no comparison totally different way of the people in how they vote.[/p][/quote]When backed in to a corner introduce a range of variables to raise a smokescreen. It doesn't matter which election it is 'the Tusc' is being scrutinised by the electorate and found unelectable.

When this article is about the Euro Elections and Local Election You do realise that there is no General Election this year that comes next year,  And TUSC is not taking part in the Euro Elections but the No2EU is, TUSC is taking part in the Local Elections only or is that to advance for you. Now get your self into order talk about Local Elections or Euro Elections[/p][/quote]All you are really interested in raising an argument on the flimsiest excuse and you will continue to live in some sort of cloud cuckoo land where success only exists in your mind.

Labour took away the pensioner reduction in council tax and reinstated the 2.5% for council managers which paid for it.. The council is stiil implementing the developmental changes in Southampton which the Conservatives instigated. Labour has not had a single idea besides feathering their own nest[/p][/quote]..........   And all of the ideas of the failed Tory council are as follows   .......

When folk start saying you do not understand - listen to me I do! Problem with some of the minority parties who complain that if we listened to them we would support them. The evidence appears to be that most folk do not vote for them because they have listened.

I think you find they want to vote for them but the fear as been put into them by the major party,s, to stop them from supporting the minority,s by saying things like if you don't vote for us you let in the other majority,

What I am doing or what I said was this.
