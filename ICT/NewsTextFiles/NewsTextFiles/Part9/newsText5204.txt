
New Delhi: Advising Hurriyat leadership in Kashmir to shun dogmatic approach and come across the table with the Government of India as Narendra Modi has declared that it will follow the line of Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

“I fail to understand why Hurriyat leadership is reluctant to hold a dialogue with the Government of India. Now the Government in India has changed and Modi has already assured that he will pursue the policies of Vajpayee, so it is high time for Hurriyat leaders to get engaged with New Delhi,” track two diplomat and former chief of Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) A.S.Dulat told CNS adding that Narendra Modi will maintain close ties with neighbouring country Pakistan.

Dulat said that the emergence of Modi and new government at the Centre has provided a new opportunity to the separatist leadership in Kashmir. “Hurriyat leadership should understand that there is nothing wrong in holding dialogue with the Modi government. They have nothing to lose and it is right time for them to share the table with Narendrea Modi,” he said.
