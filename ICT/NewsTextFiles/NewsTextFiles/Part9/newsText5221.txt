
(CNSNews.com) – French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, gearing up to  host a major U.N. climate conference at the end of next year, wants to  start referring to “climate disruption” or “climate chaos” rather than  “climate change” – since, he says, “change” can be seen as a positive  thing.

Fabius, who during a visit to Washington last week declared that the world has “ 500 days to avoid climate chaos ,” repeated this message back in Paris on his return.

The repeated reference to a looming deadline alludes to the U.N.  climate conference France will be hosting in Paris next November,  scheduled to begin in around 560 days’ time.

Earlier, during his visit to Washington, Fabius made the “500 day”  point both during a speech at the Brookings Institution and again after  holding talks with Secretary of State John Kerry at the State  Department.
