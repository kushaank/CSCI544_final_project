
New Delhi :Â  Narendra Modi is all set to stake claim to form government on Tuesday and his swearing in ceremony as the country's next Prime Minister could be held between Sunday next, May 25, and Tuesday, May 27, sources have said.

A date is yet to be formally announced for the ceremony.

He will return to Gujarat on Tuesday for a public meeting in his assembly constituency Maninagar and tell the voters that he would be resigning and moving on to Delhi.

The following day, Mr Modi will be felicitated by the BJP legislators in the assembly which is meeting for a special session. Mr Modi will then pave way for the party MLAs to elect their next chief minister by resigning from the Maninagar seat.
