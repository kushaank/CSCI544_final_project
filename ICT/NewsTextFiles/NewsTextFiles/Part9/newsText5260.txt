
Participants of a policy dialogue on Monday expressed concern that although the Punjab Transparency and Right to Information Act 2013 was enacted in December last, public information officers had still not been appointed.

“Information officers were to be appointed within 60 days of the enactment of the act,” said Beaconhouse National University (BNU) assistant professor at the School of Media and Communication Wajahat Masood.

He was addressing an RTI Baithak organised by the BNU at the Lahore College for Women University.

Masood said basic decisions regarding recruitment of these officers had still not been made. “It is a people-friendly law and should be explored in terms of how it empowers people,” he said.  Masood said it was important to know how this law could be used.

Entrepreneur Irum Bokhari said government departments rarely updated their websites.

Social development researcher Dr Rubina Saigol said it was disturbing how many people would not benefit from the law. Punjab Assembly member Hina Pervaiz Butt said the government should be praised for enacting the law.
