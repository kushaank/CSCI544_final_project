The Independent High Electoral Commission today released results of the election, the first since the US military withdrawal in 2011. They show that Nouri al-Maliki's State of Law bloc gained 92 seats in the 328-member parliament.

State of Law was not expected to command a majority outright. Maliki must now reach out to other blocs to try to cobble together a ruling coalition in a process that could take months. The next closest finisher was a group loyal to powerful Shiite cleric Ammar al-Hakim, which won 29 seats. Another under the banner of fellow Shiite firebrand Muqtada al-Sadr won 28 seats—Sadr renounced politics earlier this year, but apparently didn't mean it .

"Sadr renounced politicsearlier this year, but apparently didn't mean it."   -- A lying cleric. I'm so surprised, it's almost as if lying is their business.
