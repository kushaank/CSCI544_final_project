
CALABAR- CORRUPTION has taken over every aspect of Nigeria’s national life and unless it is rooted out,  the  country  will find it difficult addressing its current security challenges.

Archbishop Joseph Edra Ukpo, the Archbishop Emeritus of the Catholic Arch Diocese of Calabar who made the declaration in Okpoma, the Yala Local Government headquarters in Cross River State  on Sunday stated that that corruption  is severely  impeding the effective fight against Islamic insurgents currently ravaging the north east part of the country.

Archbisshop Ukpo who delivered a homily during the induction of the Paramount Ruler of Yala Local Government Area,  Ogamode  Onah Ipuole into the Knighthood  of St John  at the Christ the King Catholic Church, Okpoma stated that Nigeria is ordained by God to be  a great country but attain that status,   corruption has to be rooted out to ensure   meaningful progress  in our national life.

“Corruption is what is making it difficult to bring the Boko Haram insurgence to an end and unless we fight corruption it will be difficult for  Nigeria to make much progress as a nation  because it has taken over much of our national life”.

He called on Eje Onah Ipuole, the Yala Paramount Ruler to be steadfast with God because that is the only way God will give him the wisdom to effectively handle the affairs of the people of the local government area. “You may have your own wisdom but that wisdom is nothing compared to the wisdom of God who appointed you as the King over his people therefore you need to call on him before you take any decision that affect the people”.
