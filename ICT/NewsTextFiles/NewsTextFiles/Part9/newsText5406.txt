
Despite the absence of their leader, Raila Odinga, the CORD leaders retreated to Kibera Grounds where they roundly criticised Uhuru’s administration.

They criticised Uhuru’s administration on four fronts; corruption, “unconvincing electoral victory” in the March 4, 2013 election, public appointments they argued were driven by ethnic tagging; and Jubilee’s “determination” to sabotage and bring down Devolution.

The CORD MPs took issue with Uhuru’s resolution to pay Sh1.4 billion to Anglo Leasing firms and delegating executive powers to officials of the former provincial administration, now renamed County Commissioners. This, they argued, was meant to undermine the 47 governors.

Siaya Senator James Orengo rallied Opposition supporters to get ready to take to the streets against the perceived unpopular decisions and declared the rally at Kibera’s Kamukunji grounds as the beginning of a “Grand March”.

Orengo told the cheering supporters that CORD was planning a grand welcome for former Prime Minister Raila Odinga on May 31, when he returns from a month-long programme at a university in the United States.

The opposition also threatened to impeach President Kenyatta over his directive to Treasury to pay Sh1.4 billion for two of the Anglo-Leasing contracts. They warned State officials that they would personally be held liable for the payments.

“I am now getting rid of my suits. We are getting back onto the streets and we shall fight up to State House,’’ declared Orengo, an outspoken confidant of Raila.

“There is a time for everything. The Bible says there is a time to plant and a time to uprootâ€¦ We have been slapped many times. We can’t keep turning the other cheek,’’ said Orange nominated Senator Elizabeth Ongoro.

The President , in a televised address from State House on Saturday, explained the controversial Sh1.4 billion payment holds the key to a Sovereign Bond his government intends to float to raise hundreds of billions to fund massive infrastructure projects.
