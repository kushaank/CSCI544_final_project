
Mumbai :Â A Congress leader in Maharashtra has openly demanded Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan's resignation after the party's rout in the national election.

Deepak Mankar, the former deputy mayor of Pune, has said that Mr Chavan should step down owning moral responsibility for the Congress defeat in the state.

The Congress has won just two seats in Maharashtra and its ally NCP has won four of the state's 48 seats. The BJP and its ally Shiv Sena have won 42.

Mr Chavan, 68, has been under pressure as the Congress did not win a single seat in western Maharashtra, his stronghold.

Calls to hold the Chief Minister accountable have become louder after Nitish Kumar resigned as Bihar Chief Minister on Saturday, taking responsibility for his Janata Dal United party's drubbing.
