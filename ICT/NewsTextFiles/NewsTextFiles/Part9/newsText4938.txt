
The “Bring Back Our Girls” rally over the abducted schoolgirls from Chibok, Borno State may have recorded its first casualty on Sunday when a protester slumped and died in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.

The protest, organised by the Christian Council of Nigeria (CCN) in Port Harcourt, ended on a very sad note. One of the organisers, Rev. Ogadinma Jim-Odoi of Baptist Church, was said to have slumped and died during the rally. The “Bring Back Our Girls” campaign was billed to last 30 minutes with a march from the old Port Harcourt Township to the Government House, in the state capital.

But shortly after the campaign train arrived at the Government House, Rev. Odoi, who was the state’s Vice Chairman of the CCN, slumped and was later confirmed dead at the hospital.

The state’s Chairman of the council, Rev. Benibo Fubara Manuel, later announced the death of the cleric to the gathering of the “Bring Back Our Girls” campaigners at the end of the rally.

The CCN has called on the Federal Government to do more to secure the immediate release of the over 200 schoolgirls. Rev. Manuel, made the call during the rally. He, however, predicted an end to Boko Haram insurgency soon. Receiving the group at the Government House on behalf of the governor, the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Worgu Boms, said the state government was ready to partner the Federal Government to rescue the abducted girls and curb terrorism in the country.
