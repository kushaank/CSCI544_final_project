
Kenya: The Coalition for Reforms and Democracy ( CORD ) is planning to lead Kenyans in peaceful demonstrations to protest corruption in government.

CORD members were reacting to information that President Uhuru Kenyatta had authorised payment of Sh1.4 billion to shadowy figures in the Anglo-Leasing scandal.

Speaking to The Standard On Sunday on the telephone, Machakos Senator Johnstone Muthama said CORD has resolved to hold peaceful demonstrations to paralyse government functions.

“President Uhuru has shown Kenyans that he is lenient on graft. That is why he has given more powers to the county commissioners to use them to return Kenya to the dark ages of dictatorship,” Muthama said, on Saturday.

Muthama said CORD has already finalised plans to lead Kenyans to the streets to save the country from greedy leaders.

“Kenyans fought hard for democracy but the Jubilee coalition is taking us back. We are going to paralyse this government. We are for the teargas and bullets but workers and the general public are ready to show that they are not happy with the government,”Â  Muthama said.

Speaking at a separate function, CORD members further declared that they would not recognise the office of county commissioners recently appointed by President Uhuru.

Speaking during the burial of former Homa Bay County Assembly member Boaz Odhiambo of Kibiri ward who was shot dead by unknown gangsters last month, Siaya Senator James Orengo and Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) Minority Whip Jakoyo Midiwo led other Cord MPs in condemning the Jubilee coalition, claiming there were several ills that needed to be corrected.

Orengo said the appointment of the county commissioners was contrary to the Constitution and a plot to kill devolution.

“We will not recognise the office of the county commissioners because they were not legally appointed,” Orengo claimed.
