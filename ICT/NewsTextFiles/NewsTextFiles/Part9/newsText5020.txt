
TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu, along with party men, called on Governor ESL Narasimhan on Monday and discussed issues relating to division of the State. Naidu reportedly said he wants transparency in the whole process.

This was his first meeting with the Governor after the recent polls, where the TDP-BJP combine secured majority in residual Andhra Pradesh (Seemandhra).

Naidu is said to have raised issues relating to the State’s division and the need for transparency in the process, as the division of assets is at an advanced state.

Later, speaking to newspersons, he said he had served the State as its CM for nine years and also as the Leader of the Opposition for 10 years. “Yet I am not aware of some of the developments and decisions taken in dividing the State of Andhra Pradesh into Telangana and Seemandhra and also its assets,” he said.

He requested the Governor to ensure the division takes place without causing loss to any particular region and its people. The TDP will ensure that there is development in both the States.

The TDP chief is expected to leave for New Delhi later tonight to take part in the NDA meeting to be held there on Tuesday.
