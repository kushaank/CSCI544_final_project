
A section of Garissa MCAs have accused members of the county Public Service Board of using the courts to stay in office "illegally".

The MCAs voted out the board  on the April 9  after adopting a report from a committee, which investigated its activities. The MCAS were led by Ijara ward representative Mohamed Abdullahi and Mustapha Abdirashid of Fafi ward.

The MCAs moved to the Industrial Court on April 23, to challenge their refusal to resign. The court ordered that they should not be degazetted until the case is heard and  determined. The full hearing started on friday.

Abdullahi said the court only gave a temporary reprieve to the PSB members when it ordered that they should not be  degazetted.

“The PSB  members were not given stay orders as they would want everybody to believe. Their continued stay in office is a complete contempt of the court,” he said.

Abdullahi said the PSB members have been in office illegally since the assembly voted to remove them on April 9.
