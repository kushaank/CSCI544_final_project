
Well we haven't been let down by our last day in Venice - may even have saved the best until last! This morning we joined the queue firstly for the Basilica, another imposing cathedral embellished with lots of gold and with the most amazing tiled floor - sorry no pictures were allowed and unlike many who clearly could not read all the signs, we took no pictures. Fortunately there were some good postcards.

Next we queued for the Campanile, the church bell tower - fortunately a lift took us to the top. We were rewarded with the views we had gone there for and with an unexpected bonus! Just as we were waiting for the lift back down, standing directly under the very large bell, and only seconds after I had made the comment "you wouldn't want to be here when the bell chimed" - yep, the bell started to swing into motion! It was midday! Oh my goodness!

We also visited the Doge's Palace, another very impressive building which was the seat of government of Venice for over one thousand years, the Correr Museum and the National Archeological Museum.

We never cease to be impressed by what we see but we do think we are now ready to move on from Italy - in just over two weeks here we have absorbed quite a lot of history and culture, and enjoyed too much Italian food! We have certainly enjoyed every minute of all that we have indulged in while we have been here.

It surely was, we had to put our fingers in our ears it was so loud!
