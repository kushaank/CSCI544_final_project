
A local surfer charged for attempted murder in the second-degree made her first appearance in court Monday.

Authorities arrested Jill Anjuli Hansen, 30, after she allegedly drove a car into an elderly woman in Waikiki on Wednesday, May 14.

The incident occurred at 11:40 a.m. in the underground parking garage of Diamond Head Apartments on Kalakaua Ave, police said.

The woman, 73-year-old Elizabeth Conklin, was hospitalized in serious condition with cuts, bruises and a head injury. She spoke with KHON2 from her hospital bed.

According to court documents, the impact left Conklin partially wedged beneath another vehicle. Hansen then reversed and accelerated toward Conklin, apparently trying to strike her again, documents said.

That’s when a maintenance worker, Christopher Khoury, grabbed a crowbar from his office, shattered the back of the rear windshield and Hansen eventually jumped out, documents said.

Documents said Hansen yelled out, “My father made me do this. He’s a high-powered attorney,” before she ran away. She was later identified via a photographic lineup.

Hansen appeared to blow a kiss as she left the courtroom Monday. Her bail was confirmed at $1 million.

A preliminary hearing is set for Wednesday, May 21.
