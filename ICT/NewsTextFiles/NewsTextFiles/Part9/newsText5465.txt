
Sweden's weather agency has issued a warning ahead of storms set to hit the east coast of the country, predicting up to 50 millimetres in some parts of the country.

The good weather, however, is not far away. The agency has predicted temperatures as high as 20C in Stockholm through to Friday, the early 20s for Malm√∂, and up to 25C in Gothenburg.
