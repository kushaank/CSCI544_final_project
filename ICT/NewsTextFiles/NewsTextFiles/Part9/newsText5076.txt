
Buses, trains, garages and stations are part of the New York City landscape and most of the workers who help keep the system moving are closer to having a contract.

The agency that runs the system and the union that represents the workers have been negotiating a contract for the past two years.

On Monday, Transport Workers Union Local 100 membership, by an 82% vote of the ballots that were returned, approved the contract.

The TWU Local 100 contract includes retroactive raises of one percent each year and, moving ahead into 2016, raises of two percent. It also provides health benefits, including dental and optical benefits, and spousal benefits.

TWU Local 100 President John Samuelson says he believes the funding for this contract will come from growth of revenues to the state and increased ridership.

“It will not come from any pension fund from any segment of the workforce,” he said.

The MTA, in earlier reports, has suggested this contract would be paid for by tapping into a pension fund with connections to the Long Island Rail Road. A 14% increase in fares was also suggested. The LIRR contract is also being negotiated now and a second recommendation by a Presidential Emergency Board is expected on Tuesday.

PIX11 News Reporter Greg Mocker asked about the message for riders.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has been involved in this specific process. On April 17th, Governor Cuomo, MTA Chairman/CEO Tom Prendergast and TWU Local President Samuelson held a press conference announcing the tentative deal. It was subject to the union-membership ratification vote and the MTA Board approval, which is expected on Wednesday.
