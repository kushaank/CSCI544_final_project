
“House of Cards” star Kevin Spacey is facing criticism after reports surfaced alleging that he was paid by the Mexican government to tweet a selfie he took with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, reports TheWrap.com .

“One of these Presidents is real. With President Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico last night,” Spacey tweeted May 7 to his more than 3 million followers. A Mexican tourism official told Forbes that the actor was paid, but wouldn’t say how much.

A report from Mexico alleged that Spacey was paid $8 million by the country’s government.

Some Mexicans were outraged by the report that the actor was paid with government money, and were still skeptical, TheWrap notes.
