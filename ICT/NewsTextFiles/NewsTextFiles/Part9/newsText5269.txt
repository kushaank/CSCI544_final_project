
The top Republican in the New Jersey Assembly said the Legislature's investigation into politically motivated traffic jams at the George Washington Bridge should be suspended.

Minority Leader Jon Bramnick said the bipartisan panel should suspend hearings until the U.S. Attorney concludes his criminal investigation.

Federal authorities and the legislative panel are trying to determine who ordered approach lanes to the bridge shut last September. That caused gridlock in Fort Lee, the town at the base of the busy span linking New Jersey and New York.

The Democratic co-chairs have emphasized the importance of continuing the investigation.
