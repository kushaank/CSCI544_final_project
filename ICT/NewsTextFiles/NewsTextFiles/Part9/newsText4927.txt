
Thailand's caretaker Prime Minister Niwatthamrong Boonsongpaisan will meet the President of the Senate Surachai Liengboonlertchai to discuss ways to handle the current political crisis in the country.

Their meeting today comes in the backdrop of Thai protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban launching what he called, his final battle to oust the caretaker government by May the 26th. He said his supporters will commit all their resources and energy to see that they complete their mission. He said he will end the anti-government movement by May the 27th if the protest succeeds, and if it fails, he will turn himself in to the police.

Suthep has asked the remaining 24 caretaker ministers, including the acting Prime Minister, to resign because according to Suthep, they are all corrupt and serving the interests of ex-prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.
