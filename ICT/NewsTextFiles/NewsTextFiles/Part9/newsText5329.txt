
:: Hamza, who was born Mustafa Kamel Mustafa in Alexandria, Egypt, in 1958,    came to the UK to study in 1979.

:: He met and married an English woman, Valerie Fleming, and received British    citizenship, but the couple divorced years later.

:: On his return to the UK, Hamza started preaching radical anti-Western    sermons at the Finsbury Park Mosque, in north London.

:: Following the attacks on September 11 2001, Hamza's comments in support of    Osama Bin Laden sparked outrage.

:: In April 2002, he was formally suspended by the Charity Commission from his    position at the mosque, over his inflammatory speeches.

:: On September 11 2002, Hamza spoke at a controversial conference at the    mosque titled A Towering Day in History.

:: In January 2003, armed police arrested seven people at the mosque in a dawn    raid. A stun gun, replica firearms and CS gas canisters were among the items    seized.

:: In February 2003, Hamza again caused outrage when he described the Colombia    space shuttle, which contained Christians, Hindus and a Jewish person, as a    ''trinity of evil'' and said its destruction was a punishment from Allah.

:: In April 2003, then-home secretary David Blunkett announced new laws    allowing British citizenship to be removed from immigrants who ''seriously    prejudice'' the UK's interests. Legal moves began to get Hamza deported to    Yemen.

:: Two weeks later, his lawyers announced he would appeal against the move.

:: In May 2004, Hamza was arrested on a US extradition warrant. The US want    him on charges of conspiring to take Western hostages in Yemen, funding    terrorism, and organising a terrorist training camp in Oregon between 1998    and 2000.

:: In October 2004, he was charged with 15 offences under the Terrorism Act,    including incitement to murder and possession of a terrorism document,    temporarily staying the US extradition process.

:: On February 7 2006, Hamza was jailed for seven years after being found    guilty on 11 of 15 charges.

:: In July that year, he was given the go-ahead to challenge the convictions    for incitement to murder and race hate offences.

:: In November 2006, the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal against the    conviction.

:: In May 2007, a preliminary extradition hearing took place in London.

:: This was followed, in July 2007, by a hearing where Hamza spoke by video    link to fight the extradition.

:: In November 2007, a judge at London's City of Westminster Magistrates'    Court ruled that Hamza had lost his legal arguments against his long-running    extradition battle. Senior District Judge Timothy Workman sent the matter to    the Home Secretary to make a final decision.

:: On February 7 2008, then-home secretary Jacqui Smith signed an extradition    order, meaning Hamza would be handed over to US authorities within 28 days    if he did not appeal.

:: But Hamza appealed, delaying moves to extradite him. He later lost his bid    to avoid extradition on June 20 2008, when two High Court judges ruled that    the decision was ''unassailable''.

:: On July 23 2008, he was also refused permission to appeal to the House of    Lords when senior judge Sir Igor Judge refused to certify that his case    raised a point of law of such public importance to go before the highest    court in the land.

:: On August 4 2008, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg ruled    that Hamza should not be extradited until judges could examine his case. The    Home Office said it would abide by the court's request.

:: On February 9 2010, legal aid bosses seized Hamza's house in Greenford,    west London, to pay off his legal bills, despite the radical preacher    claiming it did not belong to him. Officials hoped to raise Â£280,000 from    the sale.

: On November 5 2010, Hamza won his appeal against the Government's attempts    to strip him of his British passport. The move would have rendered him    ''stateless'' as he had already been stripped of his Egyptian citizenship,    the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac) ruled.

:: On April 10 2012, Europe's human rights judges ruled that Hamza, along with    four other terror suspects, would not be subject to ''ill-treatment'' in    America and their extradition was lawful.

:: On September 24 2012, European judges rejected Hamza's request for an    appeal.

:: On September 26 2012, Hamza applied for an injunction against his removal    at the High Court.
