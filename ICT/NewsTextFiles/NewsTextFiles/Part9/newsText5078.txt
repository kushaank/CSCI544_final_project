
Labour has offered to consider bipartisan support for any changes to the Resource Management Act designed to make housing more affordable, Labour Leader David Cunliffe says.

“The Government has announced it will withdraw an RMA bill and campaign on the issue up to the election, because it cannot get support from its partners.

“Labour is willing to look at the housing element of the bill but would not support any weakening of the RMA’s environmental principles.

“The Government hasn’t consulted us on the bill, but we would have looked seriously at the housing elements if they had brought it to Parliament.

“On the basis of the points in their consultation document, and dependent on seeing the detail, we’d look favourably at them.

“However, they would have to split the bill and separate out their proposed changes to Part 2 of the RMA which undermine environmental protections; we will not support those,” David Cunliffe says.

Amidst the day-to-day reports about the military advances of the Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria, one remarkable aspect of this war has barely been mentioned.
