
The general elections were worst for the Left Front since 1977 with the party managing to secure only two seats out of 42 in the State. Adding insult to the injury was the victory of two turncoats within the party, who deserted the Left for the ruling party, Trinamool Congress (TMC).

With these two persons, the Left also lost its chances to grab two additional seats. Dasarath Tirkey, formerly with the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP), won Alipurduars constituency, and Sunil Kumar Mondal, a former leader with the All India Forward Bloc (AIFB), won Bardhaman Purba. They both have now become TMC MPs.

Mr. Tirkey and Mr. Mondal, MLAs of Kumargram and Galsi respectively, had made their true intentions known during the Rajya Sabha elections, when both decided to vote for the Trinamool candidate causing great embarrassment to the Left.

Eventually, they both were rewarded by the TMC as they got tickets to contest the Lok Sabha elections.

Mr. Mondal alleged that the Left panchayat officials refused to provide him with the money sanctioned to him by the Trinamool government to build a mini indoor stadium at Kanksha bloc in Bardhaman.
