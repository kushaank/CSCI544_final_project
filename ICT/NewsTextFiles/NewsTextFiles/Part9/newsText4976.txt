
There seems to be a lawsuit filed on behalf of animals every 10 minutes, but to date none of them have taken on the town of Taiji, Japan, which became infamous for its brutal dolphin roundups following the release of the Oscar-winning documentary The Cove .

This week, animal advocates from Australians for Dolphins and the Earth Island Institute’s Dolphin Project and Save Japan Dolphins campaign changed that when they filed the first ever lawsuit on behalf of the dolphins who are rounded up in the cove and killed or sold for captivity every year.

In their lawsuit, they argue that the Taiji Whale Museum, which is owned by the town, has been blocking activists and Westerners from entering – in some cases based solely on appearance – in violation of the Japanese constitution, which bans discrimination.

Reuters reported that Sarah Lucas, the CEO of Australians for Dolphins and a plaintiff in the lawsuit, said that she was shown a sign saying that people against whaling were unwelcome in the museum and denied entry when she visited in February.

Their lawyer believes they can prove discrimination in court and it shouldn’t be too hard, considering aquarium officials admitted as much to Reuters and the Associated Press .

Disruptive or not, one of the main reasons dolphin advocates want access now is to check on Angel, a rare albino calf who made headlines after being torn from her mother’s side and taken by fishermen during a violent roundup in January that drew international criticism . She is currently being kept at the museum in conditions that have been described by her advocates as deplorable.

Her advocates hope that the Action for Angel lawsuit will ensure access for those who want to document her well being and the well being of dolphins in aquariums throughout Japan, according to a statement . They also believe that it will, for the first time, compel Taiji’s government to defend its dolphin hunts. Still another hope is that legal action will lead to improvements in Angel’s living conditions, at least with a move to an enclosure where she’ll have much-needed shade and some enrichment.

Although she’s no different from any other dolphin who has been taken, she stands out and has become the poster dolphin for the outrage surrounding the ongoing captures and slaughter, in addition to having become an unfortunate and constant reminder of the role the captivity industry continues to play in the brutal drives that take place in the cove every year.

Some believe that if it weren’t for the profits captures continue to bring in, the hunt would have collapsed already. While the lawsuit alone might not end the dolphin drives, it will certainly continue to raise awareness and keep Taiji in the spotlight.

Japan is an insane filthy place that hates life. Like other corrupt Asian countries, there is no room for individuals they all bow down to a militaristic evil government no different than the one in World War II when Japan mass murdered 30 million. Money for crooks is all that Japan and its Asian brothers exist for, hence the poaching crisis coming from Asian gangs. They badly need a cleaning every once in and they got that tidal wave which cleaned out the illegal whale poaching and shark finning towns, thank God for that.

She is being bullied by the others.  She doesn't have a moments peace and that tank is way to small to hold all those dolphins.  What a nightmare for her.  I do believe they have a case but the Japanese will do and decide whatever they want to do when it is in the best "financial" interest for them.

How awful, Angel is beautiful although I'm not surprised she's being bullied by the other dolphins (she is after all different to them and likely seen as an intruder). I really do hope she get's free one day and that the plaintiff's win their case.

Unfortunately Angel probably needs to be in captivity - as an albino she's going to be vulnerable to sunburn and skin cancer in the open ocean, as well as being an obvious target for predators.  But clearly she needs to be in as large a tank as possible, with plenty of stimulation and amusements and some less aggressive company.  Animals like Angel, or that dolphin with the prosthetic tail, may have to be kept away from the wild for their own safety - but there's no excuse for not giving them as good a life as possible.

Under normal circumstances, i.e. where the animal has no medical problems, I think dolphin exhibits should use only volunteers who are able to come and go - that is, you set your exhibition up at the edge of the ocean, allow the dolphins to come and go freely, and then offer them edible bribes.  They're easily bright enough to understand "If you jump through this hoop I will give you three herrings".
