
Patna: Amid the logjam over leadership in ruling JD(U), Congress legislature party met here today and authorised its central leadership to take a decision whether to continue supporting it or not.

The CLP meeting apprised the Congress central leadership of the present political situation in Bihar and authorised them to take a decision, CLP leader Sadanand Singh told reporters.

Asked whether Congress would continue to support the JD(U) government in Bihar, Singh said "So far we have not withdrawan support. But the future course of action has to be decided by the high command."

Besides, Singh, PCC president and lone Congress MLC Ashok Choudhary and three Congress MLAs attended the meeting.

In the effective strength of 239 of Bihar assembly at present, JD(U) has 117 MLAs including Speaker, BJP has 90 members, RJD 21, Congress 4 and others, including independents and a lone CPI 7.

During the trust motion in June last year, Nitish Kumar had sailed through with the help of 4 Congress MLAs, as many Independents and 1 CPI member.
