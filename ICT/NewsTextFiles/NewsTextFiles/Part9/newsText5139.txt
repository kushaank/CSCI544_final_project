This was the statement made by Abubakar Shekau, the leader of Boko Haram, in a video clip released after his group kidnapped 300 schoolgirls in Nigeria. Among the demands made by Boko Haram, after killing civilians, abducting girls and selling them — by Allah — is to establish an Islamic caliphate!

Summary ⎙ Print Recent media reports about Boko Haram and ISIS have highlighted the need to distance so-called Islamic groups from Islam and other Muslims.

While it may be easy to condemn this group that is geographically far from us, the matter becomes more confusing when we consider the multiple news broadcasts by the Saudi Press Agency about the arrest of terrorist groups in our country. These groups are gathering arms and planning bombings, and are affiliated and in contact with the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) and al-Qaeda . And perhaps there are some who defend them, even if by saying that they are a "group who has gone astray," meaning that they are intellectually correct, but have gone too far. [Thus, according to them] it's no problem that they think those around you are infidels, that their women are captives, money warrants being stolen and the state is against religion. [According to this logic] If you translate these ideas you are "taking the wrong road," even though the road signs are telling you these words!

Those who resort to violence, sectarianism and social disintegration have no homeland; rather they are keen on allegiance to an Islamic caliphate, as is the case with Boko Haram and ISIS.
