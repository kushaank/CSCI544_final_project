
State secretary of the Communist Party of India (CPI) K. Narayana has expressed regrets over his comments against Telangana State secretary of CPI(M) T. Veerabhadram and said he is withdrawing the comments to ensure no loss to the unity among the Left parties.

In a letter written to CPI(M) politburo member B.V. Raghavulu, Dr. Narayana said on Monday that he was regretting the comments, which could not be proved. He explained that the CPI(M) alliance with YSR Congress Party in Khammam parliamentary constituency had given scope for misconceptions. He would not have faulted the alliance had the CPI(M) entered into electoral understanding with YSR Congress either across the Andhra Pradesh or in Telangana.

Dr. Narayana said he was hurt as he believed that the CPI(M) did not restrict itself to the campaigning but had acted beyond it. As a result, he had made such comments against Mr. Veerabhadram in a fit of anger, he recalled.
