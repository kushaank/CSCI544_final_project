
Dallas City Council member Jerry Allen today ordered a detailed accounting of the status of changes the city auditor recommended in recent years and city management largely failed to implement.

Allen, the chair of the Budget, Finance and Audit Committee, made the request during today’s meeting. He wants the breakdown at the committee’s June 16 meeting.

“Certainly, we can go through each one if that’s the desire of the committee,” said Jeanne Chipperfield, the city’s chief financial officer.

The report was a follow-up to reviews that produced similar results, which he presented most recently in December 2012.

Kinton looked at 93 recommendations made in 10 audit reports from fiscal 2009-10 to 2011-12. Of those, the nine city departments involved were said to have implemented 35 recommendations.

According to Chipperfield, of the 58 recommendations that remain, 17 have already been implemented or are now being implemented.

Council member Philip Kingston pointed out that city officials have been ignoring the auditor’s recommendations for years. He pinned the blame on City Manager A.C. Gonzalez.
