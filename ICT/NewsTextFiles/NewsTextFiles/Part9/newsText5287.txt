
A major problem faced by the Karachi Circular Railway Project is encroachment on railway land. The newly-elected MNA and MPAs must play their role and encourage people to move to land that is reserved for the affected people. The Sindh government removed encroachments for the Lyari Expressway project so that it could be completed. The Sindh government was also involved in removing encroachments from storm-water drains like Orangi nullah, Gujjar nullah, Lyari river and other areas so that there could be smooth water flow.

All encroachments from these projects were removed before the development projects were started. These encroachments were removed only through the efforts of political parties. Therefore, these political parties must play their role in removing encroachments from the railway land as well so that the KCR project can move ahead. The government should sign an agreement with some foreign firms for a soft loan for laying new tracks and new engines.
