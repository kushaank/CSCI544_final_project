GULFPORT, Mississippi -- A 43-year-old Gulfport man was arrested Thursday and charged with sale of cocaine, authorities said.

Alexander Johnson's arrest was the result of an operation initiated by the narcotics division of the Gulfport Police Department in March, Chief Leonard Papania said in a news release.

During the March 19 operation, Johnson sold cocaine to an individual in the 1500 block of 20th Street, authorities said.

Johnson then left the area, but an arrest warrant was issued for him. On Thursday, patrol officers found and arrested Johnson, who was in the area of 19th Street and Pratt Avenue.

The man was transported to the Harrison County Adult Detention Facility on $100,000 in bail.
