
President Obama will welcome New Zealand Prime Minister John Key back to the White House on June 20, 2014. The meeting will highlight our increasingly close relationship with New Zealand and our collaboration on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, climate change, and military-to-military cooperation. The President looks forward to consulting with Prime Minister Key on these and other issues, including the U.S. rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region, regional maritime security issues, and global security issues such as Ukraine.
