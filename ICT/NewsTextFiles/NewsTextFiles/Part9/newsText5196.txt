
The Spanish Government has accused Britain of failing to tackle a sharp rise in tobacco smuggling at the border. In a statement marking the six-month deadline set by the European Commission following its visit last year, Spain also said that cooperation with law enforcement agencies in Gibraltar had deteriorated.

The statement by the Spanish Ministry for Foreign Affairs came a day after UK Europe Minister David Lidington denounced continued delays at the border and urged Spain to act on the EC recommendations.

“Spain has established, over the past few months, that the United Kingdom has to adopt the necessary measures to tackle smuggling,” the Spanish statement said.

The Spanish ministry cited a recent incident in which a Guardia Civil officer was injured at sea while intercepting cigarette smugglers in British waters.

“This lack of cooperation in the face of an increase requires Spain to intensify controls both in the waters and at the fence,” the statement added.

According to the ministry headed by Jose Manuel García-Margallo, tobacco seizures at the border have increased 213% between 2010 and 2012, to reach 97,146 cartons in 2013. The trend had continued into 2014, with 13,781 cartons seized in the first two months of the year.

According to the reports, most tobacco smuggling is undertaken by Spanish individuals in smallish boats. There's also a largeish element undertaken by Spanish poachers in British waters. As for the Guardia Civil thug, as zathras says, what was he doing there. And, more importantly, thank you spain. Was he inside the Port of Gibraltar? I thought all the other waters were Spanish. But now you admit that they are British. Thanks very much. The spanish are no different to the argies. Just wait patiently and they'll trip themselves up in their own lies. But now let's get something meaningful out there and start shooting.

Quick word for the Guardia Civil thug. So sorry, senorita, did you get a splinter or break a nail? Didn't your mummy warn you that wearing those heels on a boat was dangerous, you nance! But pehaps it was part of the onboard entertainment! Jose's in his bunk. Trot in and drop your anchor!

Hello,

The last time I visited Portugal, I noticed that its alcohol duties were substantially greater than those levied in neighbouring Spain.

I wonder just how much Spanish booze is smuggled into Portugal and for that matter, precisely why one never hears anything whatsoever in Spanish Media of the contraband which must SURELY pass between Andorra, France, Portugal and Spain.

She seems to forget that the queen appointed governor of the Falkland Islands has no actual power and it is merely a role of observation, advice and guidance whilst acting as a intermediary between the Falklands government and parliament in the UK.

It is the Falklands government (Whom the governor is not a member off) that make its own laws and political decisions with the exception of foreign affairs and defense. The islanders therefore already elect their own politicians and political leaders, just like Argentine provinces elect their governors whom are not the same, as they are members of government where as the Falklands Governor is not a member of the UK government or the Falkland government, its there merely a ceremonial role, though also has powers related to defense and internal security of the islands, provided by the UK.

If he had been where he should have been in Spanish waters he wouldn't have been assaulted by a fag-lesson stick to your own territory.

Perhaps you'd like to truncate your truncated messages permanently.

That's less than £500,000 p.a. for the whole illegal business transiting Gibraltar. Spanish workers on The Rock treat it as a 'perk'.

What do the Spanish Customs do with the cartons they interdict? ... pull the other one!

'Overland cigarette exports into Gibraltar tripled between 2006 and 2011.

Since then, the trend had “intensified” to reach more than 11.4m cartons exported into Gibraltar by land.'

I believe that this is called 'trade', they do it 'wholesale' and it is quite a common thing in the EU.

I leave you to guess where the REAL problem is.

P. S.

Given your seemingly insatiable interest in my ‘umble person, I’ll tell that in 1066 my paternal ancestor arrived in Briton with a namesake of yours, one William the Bastard. My mother’s side come down from a bunch of ne’re do well, wild Welsh tribesmen who caused rather a lot of bother for the odd English land grabbing monarch in during formers’ efforts to annex Wales.

Until you feel ready to give your own background, may I suggest you go back to playing with your fcuking CONKERS!

Spanish cigarette prices have doubled in the last 5 years hence the doubling in smuggling figures . .. thats what happens and has been for hundreds of years. Not so long ago when Spanish tobacco was cheap the Brits were stuffing their suitcases with cartons on their return home.

Go to any Spanish Kiosk on the costa and they will openly sell you Gibraltar cigarettes (they have a English health warning) at a euro cheaper purchased from Spanish smugglers and ignored by the corrupt police....  So what ddoes Spain do.... point the finger at Gibraltar and complain.

Sorry, but nowhere in the Spanish statement will you find the assertion that the recent incident in which a Civil Guard happened in British waters.

Incidentally, do you know that the Spanish word CHULO really means PIMP in English? It seems you’ve chosen a stable career; for your line of business is always one of the last to fail –even in periods of recession so severe as today’s.

Cheers!

Interesting!

As a matter of fact, chulo means pimp only in its eighth acception. The first one can be translated as arrogant or even cheeky. Look at it in the Spanish Royal Accademy Dictionary.

Well this is a predictable response from the Spanish government who are entirely disinterested in having good relations with Gibraltar. This is just a figleaf of an excuse to hide behind to provide justification of the continued bullying of Gibraltar.

I think its intolerable for the FCO to think that it's ok for us to have normal relations with Spain whilst Spanish aggression against Gibraltar continues. They need to stop being so bloody Neville Chamberlain and wake up and smell the coffee. I would suggest, based upon the current actions of the Spanish government towards Gibraltar that Spain is not a friendly country towards the UK. Pretending it is whilst its not is folly.

This is only ever going to get resolved when Spain begins to associate doing bad things to Gibraltar with the UK doing even badder things to Spain. This requires a statement of intent from our government which outlines that we'll come gunning for the Spanish govt if they continue their actions against Gibraltar. If they fail to heed the warning then nothing is off limits. We'll punish Spain diplomatically, we'll punish them economically, we'll seize their Police boats if they trespass  and we'll set our Intelligence Services against the Spanish leadership to see what new corruption scandals we can reveal.

Today the MOD played down the report in the EXPRESS that extra men were being sent to Gibraltar,

they say it was done at the end of 2013, and only a few extra,

some say, we are kowtowing to our political masters in the European oval office,

just saying like..

When I started speaking Spanish 62 years’ ago, no self-respecting Spaniard would have called himself a chulo. Of course, I realise that idiomatic usage DOES evolve, especially in our gloriously unfettered, anarchic, native English –less so in tongues such as Spanish and French, which are “kept in order” by the diktats of the doddering daft ol’ farts –some of whom are almost as geriatric as yours truly– rabbiting-on in their respective “Academies of the Language”.

If in English, I refer to someone as stupid ol’ sod, I’m not LITERALLY saying he’s an aged, witless sodomite. Likewise, if I say a fellow is a miserable bastard, I ain’t stating he’s lacking material wherewithal and also illegitimate. And if you want to go a bit father back in time, and take a careful shufti at the word AWFUL, you’ll find that ORIGINALLY, it signified summat akin to: AMAZING, GREAT OR WONDERFUL BEYOND HUMAN COMPREHENSION or UNDERSTANDING. However centuries’ of misuse by the ignorati eventually gave AWFUL the essentially erroneous connotation it transmits today.

Oddly –to me at least–AWSOME (so enthusiastically overworked by some) still retains its initial meaning.

For more than 20 years’ I wrote articles in Spanish on physics and electronics for the technical press in this country, so –as fortunately, I’m still completely compos mentis (says he!)– I don’t feel I’m in need of private Spanish tutoring by E-mail. Thanks, anyway!

Regarding the fact that so many Scots wish to “emancipate” themselves, I’ve never suggested otherwise. Furthermore, given the AWFUL incompetence and the appalling lack of interest for the welfare of the citizenry at large, so clearly demonstrated and practiced by our present, self-serving Westminsterite ‘see-you-next-tuesdays’, I ain’t in the least surprised that some of those north of the border are on the verge of “revolting” (JOKE)!

If I were a little younger, I’d declare my own, Peoples’ Republic of Jim’s Back Yard and tell all those of our devious political class to get right-royally Rogered!

Cheers!

Sorry for the e-mail tutoring, but the history of the word is rather interesting. Anyway, you're welcome.

It is refreshing to find an open-minded person in this kind of fora. Good luch with that People's Republic at you own back yard.

Olisipo, also in Madrid.
