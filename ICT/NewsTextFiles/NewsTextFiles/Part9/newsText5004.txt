"Cards in Hand" (Li Xiao Guai 李小乖) Xi Jinping holds onto a fierce hand of cards, each reading "arrest," as he faces off against a team of rights lawyers, journalists ,  activists , and artists  in the weeks leading up to June 4th, 2014.

"The Attorney" (Badiucao 把丢草/CDT). Prominent civil rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang was placed under criminal detention on Tuesday, May 6 along with several others after attending a weekend meeting about a June 4th commemoration. Pu, who is being held under the charge of "causing a disturbance," received much support on social media , including a covert endorsement from model and actress Zhang Ziyi . Zhang made reference to the South Korean film  The Attorney  (변호인), the story of a man's rise from tax lawyer to human rights champion, inspired by the life of former South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun. CDT resident cartoonist Badiucao reimagined the popular film's promo poster.

"So Many Lawyers" (Li Xiao Guai 李小乖/Blogtd.org) Pu is not the only rights lawyer in detention during this sensitive time. Most recently, Tang Jingling, Liu Shihui, and Qu Zhenhong—herself Pu's lawyer and niece—were reportedly detained last week . Li Xiao Guai illustrates one take on how an event like the one that inspired The Attorney might have unfolded in China.
