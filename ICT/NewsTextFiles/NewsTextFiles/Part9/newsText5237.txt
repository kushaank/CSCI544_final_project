The government’s failure to secure fiscal incentives for industrial investment requires it to think “outside the box” and find alternative solutions, PN deputy leader Mario de Marco said.

Addressing a press conference outside the Chamber of Commerce in Valletta, de Marco expressed the opposition’s concern at the economic slowdown, especially in the manufacturing and retail sectors.

“Although the country’s economy is growing, a number of sectors are not doing well,” de Marco said, adding that this was confirmed by the European Commission’s report on the Maltese economy.

Pointing out that Malta registered the largest reduction in exports out of the EU28 and a 15% reduction in imports, de Marco warned government not to take the economy for granted.

Earlier, the PN lambasted government for its failure in convincing the EU against reducing fiscal incentives for industrial investment.

He went on to urge government to focus on all economic sectors and not only the successful ones, such as financial services.

Earlier today, deputy Prime Minister Louis Grech said that government could not be blamed for the EU’s decision to restrict Malta’s fiscal incentives for industrial investment.

He said government was faced with a "fait accompli" since the European Commission had adopted the funding guidelines for industry in February 2013.

However, in a statement issued this afternoon, the PN rubbished Grech’s claims and blamed the reduction in incentives on the government’s “incompetence” in negotiating with the EU.

The opposition also denied that the decision was taken last year, adding that the decision was taken this month and government had 14 months to address the situation.
