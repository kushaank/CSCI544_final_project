
PANAJI: If opposition to the proposed Bainguinim solid waste treatment plant intensifies, making it impossible for the corporation of the city of Panaji (CCP) to proceed with its plan, the city corporation should seize the offer of St Cruz MLA Atanasio 'Babush' Monserrate, feels mayor  Surendra Furtado.

Furtado is of the opinion that  CCP should build its waste treatment plant on 25,000 sq m of land in Taleigao offered by Monserrate.

"The CCP should accept St Cruz MLA's offer of land in Taleigao," said mayor Furtado to TOI on Monday.

Monserrate said Bainguinim project will not see the light of the day with a priest and others opposing the project. "There is a mutt in the area. Re-elected North  Goa MP Shripad Naik is a devotee of the mutt. In the days to come pressure will build up against the project," said Monserrate.

Monserrate said Taleigao has its own site spread over 25,000 sq m which can be utilized for building a joint plant for treatment of Taleigao and Panaji garbage. He has placed his proposal before chief minister Manohar Parrikar . Parrikar has responded positively to the proposal, he said.

The CCP's long pending plan of having its own solid waste treatment plant at Bainguinim has been continuously opposed by Bainguinim locals, panchayat as well as two religious bodies located in the area.

People opposing the project raised their heads again after CCP last week adopted a resolution for converting the 1.78 lakh sq m of land at Bainguinim into industrial zone to expedite the process of obtaining various permissions required for the plant. The mayor had said the resolution will be placed before the government and after its approval they will proceed with Bainguinum.

Although the project was initiated a few years ago, the CCP has not been able to process it thanks to on and off opposition to the project. It has been able to build only a compound wall at the project site.
