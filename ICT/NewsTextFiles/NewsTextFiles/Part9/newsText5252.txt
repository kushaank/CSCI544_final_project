
New Delhi, May 19: Expelled AAP MLA Vinod Kumar Binny today called upon BJP, AAP and Congress to consider civil activist Kiran Bedi for the post of Delhi chief minister, saying that holding fresh Assembly elections would be a wastage of public money.

"I have written to AAP, BJP, Congress and Independent MLAs to come together and make Bedi the Delhi chief minister as she doesn't belong to any political party. I would definitely support a BJP-AAP coalition if they make Bedi their CM candidate and come out with a common minimum agenda to run the government," Binny said during a press conference here.

Binny, who was expelled by AAP for being involved in anti- party activities after Assembly elections, said that he was also ready to support an AAP-Congress coalition if it was willing to back Bedi as the chief minister.

"I don't want Delhiites to face re-polls as it is totally a waste of public money. People have given a mandate for five years and it is the responsibility of all political parties to respect that," Binny said.

Binny claimed that before last year's Assembly polls, AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwl had wanted to make Bedi, a former IPS officer, his party's chief ministerial candidate.  He also said that BJP was seemingly open to supporting Bedi's name for chief minister.

Asked whether he was ready to support an alliance which did not want Bedi as chief minister, Binny said that if AAP and BJP or AAP and Congress came out with any other consensus candidate, he would support that too, but they should first have a common minimum agenda for the government.

"If the parties don't agree on Bedi's name, they can select (somebody else), but they should come out with a common minimum programme to run the government.  "I would also support a coalition of such parties for avoiding fresh polls in Delhi," he added.
