
DAIRY farmers are calling on the government to review the raw milk price, which they have labelled as "very little".

Dairy farmer Hirday Lakhan said the price of raw milk the farmers were getting was little and they were affected by this.

Mr Lakhan said they had not received an increase in the price of milk since 2012.

"We have asked the government to do something about it," Mr Lakhan said.

"Before we used to sell the milk direct to the factory and the factory belonged to us. Now the factory does not belong to us, it belongs to CJ Patel and we are not selling directly to CJ Patel.

"We have to go through Fiji Cooperative Dairy Company Limited (FCDCL) and they are deducting 10 cents VAT per litre of milk. It's more than 13 to 14 per cent of deductions."

Mr Lakhan said the raw milk price was 78cents and another 4cents was deducted by FCDCL.

He said the price of imported milk had been increasing and the last increase was in 2012 when the farmers were getting $1 plus VAT.

FCDCL chief executive Sachida Nand said the farmers needed to get a fair price for their raw milk.

At the moment, he said they were paid only 78cents per litre.

He said many farmers were confused about whether they would get a price increase and FCDCL was trying to get them a fair price.

"We're only paid $1 a litre since the change of ownership.

The price decrease was from $1 a litre to 0.78cents a litre."
