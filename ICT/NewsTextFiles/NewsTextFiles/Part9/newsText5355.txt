
NEW DELHI: Setting an example for both sitting and former ministers in UPA's 10-year rule, outgoing defence minister A K Antony wants to shift out of his ministerial bungalow. Sources said Antony has asked the Rajya Sabha secretariat to allot him a smaller house when such an accommodation is available.

Antony's move comes at a time when all the UPA ministers would be required to vacate their bungalows in Lutyens' Delhi. According to rules, ministers must vacate such accommodation within a month after leaving office or after the Council of Ministers is dissolved. "If they fail to do so, eviction process starts. We have to meet the demand of the new government. The decision will be taken as soon as a new minister takes charge," said an urban development ministry official.

Sources said a list of bungalows falling under top category has been prepared to ensure that the present occupants shift out for the new ministers to move in.

Besides ministers, the government now has a huge task of providing permanent accommodation to newly elected MPs in the Lok Sabha. For new MPs, Lok Sabha secretariat has asked directorate of estates in urban development ministry to make arrangement for accommodation for 300 MPs till they move in to their official residence. The department has told three ITDC hotels to keep about 150 rooms while state guest houses have confirmed to provide rooms to about 210 MPs.

"Our biggest concern is to meet the needs of new government since huge number of bungalows under general pool residential accommodation (GPRA) have been allotted to many, some of whom are not even entitled. There are politicians who have been staying in these houses even after demitting ministers' office," said a senior official, on the condition of anonymity.

Recently, an RTI reply had revealed that 22 former ministers including A Raja, Mukul Roy, SM Krishna, Pawan Kumar Bansal and CP Joshi are overstaying in bungalows allotted to them under GPRA. Sources said ideally once a minister demits office he should vacate the house and get new accommodation under either Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha pool. "Unfortunately, this rule is hardly followed as the allotments get regularized no matter whoever has come to power," an urban development ministry official said.

Besides, there are several cases of out-of-turn allotment or retention of bungalows for politicians and former bureaucrats. Some of the recent cases of such use of discretionary power relate to Murli Deora and RJD chief Lalu Prasad.
