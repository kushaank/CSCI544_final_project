
PATNA: Jitan Ram Manjhi will be the new chief minister of Bihar. On Monday evening, acting chief minister Nitish Kumar took him to Raj Bhavan, where Manjhi, 68, in his capacity as the new leader of JD(U) legislature party (LP) staked claim to form the new government.

Manjhi, who was minister of SC/ST welfare department under Nitish, will be the first chief minister belonging to musahar community â€” the poorest caste among the sections of the society.

A graduate from Magadh University, Manji belongs to Khizir Sarai in Gaya district and currently represent Makhdoompur assembly constituency in Jehanabad. He had contested recently-concluded Lok Sabha polls from Gaya seat and lost with a big margin by BJP's Hari Manjhi.

After coming out from the Raj Bhavan, Nitish, who was accompanied by party national president Sharad Yadav and state chief Bashistha Narain Singh, said Manjhi has staked claim for government formation and submitted a list of 116 JD(U) MLAs besides letters of support from one CPI and two independent MLAs. The present strength of the assembly is 239.

"We have full number for government formation," he said.

Nitish Kumar said Manjhi has experience in the party and the government and he will head the new government.

The JD(U) LP meeting had earlier authorized Nitish to nominate new leader of the party, but also resolved that the party will contest 2015 assembly under Nitish and on getting the public mandate the party will form the government under Nitish.
