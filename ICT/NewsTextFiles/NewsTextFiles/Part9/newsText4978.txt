
Kate Middleton is currently putting the finishing touches on a housewarming party for her and Prince William.

The future Queen of England is living with her royal husband at Kensington Palace, where the finishing touches are being put on their mansion on Sandringham estate, according to Express.co.uk.

She has been noticeably missing from Prince William's official royal appearances of late, most notably his Royal Marsden charity dinner, hosted by Ralph Lauren.

And the mother to little Prince George has been busy working on the interior design of their home, rather than hiring an outsider.

While they prepare to move into the estate soon, extra security has also been incorporated into the design of the home, including lengthening their driveway so that nearby churchgoers will not have as easy access.

Meanwhile, it has emerged that Middleton reportedly chatted to Cressida Bonas before she split with Prince Harry to understand the pressures she'll be faced with while dating a royal.

"Kate feels for Cressie. There's an awful lot of pressure when the whole nation is asking if asking if you're about to get engaged," the source revealed to British magazine Now.

Many believe that the break is just a temporary one, as both Harry and Cressida are said to still be very fond of each other.

Harry joined his brother William over the weekend in Memphis, to celebrate the wedding of their good friend Guy Pelly and his hotel heiress wife Lizzy Wilson, an occasion Cressida should have been by his side for.

"Harry' s still besotted with Cressie, but the last thing he wants to do is put pressure on her. They're both very cautious but it wouldn't surprise me if they got back together," the source added.
