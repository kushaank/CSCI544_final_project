PINCONNING TOWNSHIP, MI — A married couple and their dog made it out of their rural home before a fire burned most of it.

At about 6:13 p.m. on Sunday, May 18, firefighters were dispatched to 678 E. Neuman Road in Pinconning Township, according to Pinconning Township Fire Chief David Ramsay. When they arrived, the back of the house was fully involved, Ramsay said.

The residents were eating dinner when the fire started and made it outside before firefighters' arrival, Ramsay said. Neither the residents nor their dog were injured, the chief added.

The fire was contained in about one hour and 45 minutes, Ramsay said. One firefighter suffered an injury when he hyperextended his knee, but he was treated and released.

About 65 percent of the house was damaged.

"The house will probably be tore down because it's an old farmhouse," Ramsay said. He added that the residents are staying with family.

The cause of the fire remains under investigation, but it appears accidental, Ramsay said.

Firefighters from Standish and Kawkawlin and Mount Forest townships assisted at the scene.

Another structure fire was reported by Bay County Central Dispatch at 813 W. Salzburg Road in Williams Township at about 11:50 p.m. on Saturday, May 17. The Times was unable to reach firefighters for comment.
