
Through its Volunteer Fire Assistance (VFA) program, the Virginia Department of Forestry (VDOF) awarded more than $199,000 in grants to 140 volunteer fire departments (VFDs) across the Commonwealth. The grants – ranging in size from $315 to $2,435 – will be used by the VFDs for such purchases as personal protective equipment, communications gear, water tanks for brush trucks, wildland fire specialty tools and training materials.

Volunteer fire departments provide VDOF with receipts for their equipment purchases. Under the terms of the grant, VDOF reimburses the volunteer fire departments up to the amount approved for their eligible purchases.

A total of 171 fire departments applied for grants this year, and 140 were approved. The requests for support totaled more than $1.1 million – far more than the $199,942.89 VDOF had available. Since the VFA program began in 1975, the VDOF has awarded more than $3.4 million to volunteer fire departments throughout the Commonwealth. Funding for the grant program is provided by the U.S Forest Service.
