
ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Sunday advised the officials to consult representatives of trade bodies and all the stakeholders in preparation of budget proposals.

While chairing at the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to review budget process here, the minister said chambers of commerce, all professional bodies and representatives of industry should be consulted in preparation of budget.

Earlier, on Saturday, finance minister had chaired a meeting of Tax Advisory Council to discuss the budget proposals. The meeting was attended by FBR officials, chartered accountants, academia, retired senior officers, President Tax Bar, industrialists, presidents of chambers of commerce and trade, senior tax consultants, and representatives of professional associations including SECP, Pakistan Banking Association, ISE, ICAP, ICMA, KSE and LSE.

During the meeting different trade bodies recommended the finance minister to increase in federal excise duty on luxury items like electronics and cigarettes but decrease the GST rate.

The Minister said government would neither enhance the tax rates nor new taxes would be levied in the coming budget. However, the government is keen to enhance the tax base of the country to enhance revenue generation to find fiscal space for energy development. He emphasized the taxpayers should be facilitated by simplifying tax reporting.

“We have to focus on expanding the tax net and enabling the government to find fiscal space for allocation of funds in development of energy and infrastructure,” said Dar.

The finance minister has time and again said that economic recovery is the first priority of the PML-N government and reforms introduced by the government have put the economy on the right direction.

The sources said that the government is going to withdraw the tax exemptions worth of Rs150 billion and to take additional taxation measures worth of around Rs80 to Rs100 billion in the upcoming budget.
