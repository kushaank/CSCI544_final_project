
Holographic technology has been used on a few big names in the music industry, both dead and alive, such as when the brought back the image of Tupac a few years ago . The latest effort sees King of Pop, Michael Jackson return to the stage five years after his death to perform a single from his new album, which was obviously also released after his death.

The new album, Xscape is actually rather good, pretty much what you have come to expect from Jackson and a great addition to any music lovers collection, but the new performance is both amazing and creepy at the same time as he performs the Slave to the Rhythm, his latest single.

The performance was recorded at this weeks Billboard Music Awards in the United States. Kick back and enjoy the song and even if you’re not a fan of the music, this is a pretty awesome technical achievement to watch.
