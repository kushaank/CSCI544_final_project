
PHOENIX (KSAZ) - A Phoenix firefighter killed in the line of duty in a tragic accident was honored Monday.

Brad Harper was given a historical marker by the Phoenix Fire Department and United Firefighters Association.  It's located at 3811 W. Lower Buckeye Road.

"His dedication, courage and spirit will always be remembered," said acting Phoenix Fire Dept. Chief Kara Kalkbrenner.

Brothers and sisters within the department family and friends of fallen firefighter Brad Harper gathered on Lower Buckeye Road at a dedication ceremony in his honor.

"When I say it's somber.. I can't believe it's been a year. It brings tears to the eyes, but we're much better as an organization than we were a year ago, so that is a celebration," said Deputy Chief Chris Ketterer.

It was one year ago that Harper lost his life. Rescue 21 was on a call.  Harper was killed when he became trapped between a fire engine and a rescue ambulance's door.

A police investigation found that the driver of the engine did not use a spotter when driving in reverse.  The 37,000-pound fire truck ended up hitting Harper.

The historic marker will now forever remain a part of the community Harper loved and served, just as his memory will live on in the hearts of those who knew him.

Harper was a two year veteran of the Phoenix Fire Department.
