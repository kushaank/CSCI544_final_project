
PESHAWAR: The gulf between old and new workers of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) is widening with each passing day in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa while the party has already split into two groups in the adjacent Federally Administered Tribal Areas.

The leaders of every group claim to be the real nominees of the central leadership of the party and blame their rivals for weakening the party.

The workers, who resigned from PML-Q and joined PML-N under the leadership of Eng Amir Muqam on April 6, 2012, are considered new entrants in the party.

Mr Muqam was provincial president of PML-Q but he brought all its active workers along with him to PML-N. Despite lapse of over two years, the â€˜oldâ€™ and â€˜newâ€™ workers are not ready to accept each other.

The differences in PML-N came to surface during nomination of office-bearers in different tribal regions. PML-N leaders in Fata are openly criticising against each other.

The gulf was further widened when a group of PML-N workers called on Governor Sardar Mehtab Ahmed Khan in Peshawar few days ago.

On Sunday, a meeting of the party workers from Fata was held at the residence of Mr Muqam at Hayatabad wherein they lashed at PML-N provincial general secretary Rehmat Salam Khattak for what they called interfering in affairs of Fata organisation of the party.

Addressing the meeting, Faqir Mohammad, Haji Baz Gul Afridi, Sardar Azam Afridi, Faqir Gul Janbaz, Dilawar Khan Mehsud, Nek Amal Khan Wazir, Haji Zahir Shah, Abdullah, Gul Naeem, Sher Mohammad Mehsud, Malik Nisar Mohmand, Mehmoodullah, Haji Sohail Afridi, Khalid Khan, Behram Khan Mohmand, Mohammad Akbar and Naushad Khan accused Mr Khattak of weakening the party.

They said that PML-N president Mian Nawaz Sharif appointed Mr Muqam coordinator of the party for Fata and he appointed Faqir Mohammad president of PML-N in Fata to organise the party in all tribal regions.

â€œAfter a long time our party got a chance to appoint its governor in the province with the hope that PML-N will be strengthened in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Fata by resolving the problems of people in the region but people like Mr Khattak are spoiling the opportunity,â€� said Faqir Mohammad.

He said that Mr Khattak had no right to interfere in the party affairs in Fata as he should focus on the organisation of the party in the province.

However, Mr Khattak told Dawn that as per past traditions of the party, the provincial chapter had to notify the office-bearers for Fata. He said that Faqir Mohammad had so far not been notified as PML-N president of Fata chapter.

He said that there was no fresh notification about appointment of any leader as coordinator or president for Fata and therefore he had to call the existing office-bearers for a meeting with the governor. â€œI canâ€™t accept self-styled office-bearers because those claiming to be appointed should bring notification and stop the cold war in violation of the party discipline,â€� Mr Khattak.

He said that the party constituted a committee to resolve the differences and nominate office-bearers but Mr Muqam violated the discipline and announced people of his choice prior to decision of the committee. â€œWe will not let down our old workers,â€� Mr Khattak said.

Said Wali Shah and Ikramullah Khan Kokikhel, who claimed to be the real leaders of the party in Khyber Agency, said that they were not ready to accept Faqir Mohammad as president.

â€œWe are not ready to accept PML-N Q workers as our leaders because they canâ€™t be trusted and can leave the party anytime,â€� Mr Kokikhel said. He said that at present there was no coordinator for Fata and the issue would be taken up with Raja Zafarul Haq and Mian Nawaz Sharif otherwise the partyâ€™s future would be at stake.

â€œOur meeting with the governor proved that we are in majority and have the right to get office-bearers of our choice so that the party can be strengthened in Fata,â€� Mr Kokikhel said.

Mr Muqam was not available for comments as he has been abroad. However, his press secretary said that PML-N coordinator for Fata was Mr Muqam and he had the right to name office-bearers for tribal regions.

I hope that they keep doing so so that they are uprooted from there.

Nature understands her business better than any of us do.

Self greed going to destroy the party just like PPP.  Hold elections let workers choose, no appointments. Now PM should release his party leadership, let new leaders sort out the party problems--while he pay attention country's problem. Alas! what a naÃ¯ve wishful thinking I got.
