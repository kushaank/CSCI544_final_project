
First, let us deal with the pronunciation of ‘impetuous’. The first syllable is like the ‘im’ in ‘impossible’ and ‘immediate’, while the second sounds like the word ‘pet’. The first ‘u’ is pronounced like the ‘u’ in ‘put’, ‘push’ and ‘pull’, while the final ‘ou’ sounds like the ‘a’ in ‘china’. One way of pronouncing the word is ‘im-PET-yu-es’, with the stress on the second syllable. When a person does something without really thinking things through, he can be accused of being impetuous or impulsive. In both cases, the individual is taking decisions on the spur of the moment; he does things without really considering the consequences of his action. Of the two, ‘impetuous’ has a negative connotation. When you say that someone is impetuous, you are suggesting that the individual is hot-headed; the decisions he takes are rather reckless, and they usually result in something bad happening.

*Raina’s impetuous decision resulted in a huge loss for the company.

*My impetuous cousin bought a car even before he got a job.

‘Impulsive’, like ‘impetuous’, can be used with both people and their actions. An ‘impulsive’ person, like an ‘impetuous’ one, is governed by his emotions. Being impulsive, however, need not necessarily be bad; an impulsive decision may result in something good happening.

Ram’s impulsive decision to bet on the horse paid off big time.

In British English, it is possible to use the word ‘bath’ as a noun and a verb. When used as a verb, it means to wash or bathe someone in a tub or a container filled with water. It can also be used to mean to wash oneself.

*Jeeva baths every evening after returning from the gym.

Our little puppy smells. I think it’s your turn to bath him.

Some people think that this use is rather old fashioned. Americans do not use ‘bath’ as a verb — they prefer to use ‘bathe’, instead.
