EL PASO, Texas - El Paso firefighters are banding together to help one of their own--who's been battling cancer for almost a year.

Firefighter and battalion chief Matthew Thomas, 43, who's been with the department for 17 years, was diagnosed with grade-3 brain cancer in July of 2013.

With medical expenses weighing the family down, local firefighters came up with the "Brotherhood Benefit"--an event that they hoped would raise enough funds to help Thomas and his family pay for those mounting bills.

"He's had a lot of expenses, and had a tough battle, so we've come together to throw this event for him to show him that we're here for him," said Don Wiklund, a retired El Paso firefighter.

A group organized the event at the Cabo Joe's at Zaragoza in East El Paso on Sunday. It included the raffling of an AR-15 rifle and a weekend getaway to Cloudcroft, N.M. Firefighter memorabilia was also auctioned off. Local bands performed in front of patrons. Cabo Joe's donated a portion of their sales to the Thomas fundraiser.

"We don't know how much we've raised, but we're hoping to raise $20,000," said Wiklund.

Whatever the outcome, the event left Thomas speechless.

"I could never thank them enough. Words cannot express how thankful I am," said Thomas. "Really. It's unbelievable. I want to thank Don Wiklund--this is unbelievable."

Thomas said he never expected the amount of support he's been receiving--much less at Sunday's event.

"Firefighters stick together. It's really unbelievable. I can't thank them enough. It's been a hard road, but anyone with cancer needs to take care of themselves."

According to the fundraising site GiveForward.com, $4,540 of the $20,000 goal has been raised. To help Thomas, click here .
