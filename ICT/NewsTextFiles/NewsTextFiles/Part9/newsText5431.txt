
Seventy firefighters in ten engines battled last night to bring a huge fire under control in Camden Town, north London.

Hundreds of people were evacuated as the blaze took hold in the Stables Market area of the popular tourist destination - sending a giant cloud of black smoke high into the sky over the capital.

The fire was last night reported to have begun in a shop that had closed for the day.

A security guard is understood to have tried in vain to put the blaze out before firefighters arrived.

London Fire Brigade announced it had got the fire under control just before midnight, with the area around the market remaining closed off in the early hours of the morning.

The extent of the damage to the market is not yet clear - or when it will reopen. Fortunately no-one was reported to have been hurt in the blaze.

Witnesses Tweeted updates from outside the market as firefighters battled the flames.

The fire was witnessed by funk and reggae band Times Six. They were preparing for a concert in a nearby bar when they saw the smoke.

As reported by the Camden New Journal, keyboard player K-Loe said: "We suddenly saw smoke gushing in and security saying we had to evacuate immediately.

'There was at least 200 - may be more - people rushing out. The smoke was thick, black.'

Some 40 million people visit the market each year, according to its website.

It houses dozens of stalls selling international cuisine, fashion and home decorations.
