
New York--(ENEWSPF)--May 19, 2014.  Today Judge Michael McShane struck down Oregon’s discriminatory state constitutional amendment that denies committed gay couples the freedom to marry, ruling that it violates the U.S. Constitution. The decision follows a last-minute attempt by the anti-gay group National Organization for Marriage (NOM) to intervene in Oregon’s marriage case, a motion denied by Judge McShane.

A poll by Oregon Public Broadcasting in late April found that  58% of Oregonians support the freedom to marry . The Oregon ruling is the latest in more than a dozen federal and state rulings in favor of the freedom to marry in recent months.

Freedom to Marry  is the campaign to win marriage nationwide. We are pursuing our  Roadmap to Victory  by working to win the freedom to marry in more states, grow the national majority for marriage, and end federal marriage discrimination. We partner with individuals and organizations across the country to end the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage and the protections, responsibilities, and commitment that marriage brings.
