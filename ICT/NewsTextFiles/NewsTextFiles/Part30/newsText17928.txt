Temperatures are on Monday forecast to jump especially in Southern and Central Finland but also to breach the 25-degree Celsius mark in northern Ostrobothnia and southern Lapland, reveals Henri Nyman, an on-duty meteorologist at the Finnish Meteorological Institute.

In south-east Finland, he says, the mercury may even climb to threaten the month's temperature record of 31 degrees, recorded in Lapinjärvi in 1995.

The high temperatures may also bring about severe thunderstorms, Nyman cautions.

“Thunderstorms are what will keep us busy today. In the afternoon and evening, the conditions are relatively threatening,” he says.

If the low-pressure area strengthens sufficiently, it may bring about severe thunderstorms.

“The difficulty is that there are cold sea areas in between and the situation is sensitive. It may be that the thunderclouds do not develop. This is kind of an either-or situation: if the thunderstorms develop, they will be severe, but they may also not develop at all,” Nyman explains.
