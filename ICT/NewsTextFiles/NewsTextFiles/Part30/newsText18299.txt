
Washington : George Clooney and his fiancee Amal Alamuddin are set to marry this autumn, a source has revealed, says ANI.

The insider told US magazine that Clooney would marry her today if he could, but he wants to give her a dream wedding. The source said that it is her first, and he wants it to be his last.

And if the reports are to be believed, Clooney isn’t the only one anxious to speed up the nuptials. The Lebanon-born beauty’s parents “are old-fashioned when it comes to these things,” US magazine reported.

As for the actual location of the ceremony, the London-based attorney and L.A. resident are considering his beloved Lake Como, Italy, or Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, which are both owned by Clooney.

It is also said that Clooney is buying a home in London to support Amal as she is reluctant to relocate her career. Despite the 16-year-age gap, Hollywood’s most eligible bachelor, is keen to make the relationship work and is said to be happy to compromise for the 36-year-old brunette, reports Daily Mail.
