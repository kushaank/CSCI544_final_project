Roberto, whose right leg was heavily bandaged, later grappled with the lead belonging to his Alsatian dog as he and Lina made their way back to the luxury yacht aboard which they’ve been residing.

Lina was equally relaxed in a white jacket and cropped denim shorts that revealed a pair of lithe legs.

Roberto’s girlfriend was previously spotted tanning her nicely toned body on the top deck of their boat in a pair of printed shorts that enhanced her pert derriere.

Her look was rounded off with a casual black top and flats as she padded from one side of the boat to the other looking every inch the lady of leisure.

Last year Roberto and Lina were willing to show off just how intimate they are with each other as Roberto exposed himself to his younger lover and she happy gave a helping hand to clean his private areas while holidaying in Porto Cervo, Italy.

With his body reasonably tanned, the designer flashed his white bottom for the world to see as Lina got in and gave him a very personal rub down.

‘A  princess should be sexy,’ he told Vogue magazine, before adding: ‘She  is young, she is beautiful – I would like to create something special  for her.'
