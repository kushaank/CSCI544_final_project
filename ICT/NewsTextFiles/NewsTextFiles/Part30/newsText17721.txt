
The level of bad loans held by Spanish banks, which peaked at the end of 2013, edged down in March to 13.39 per cent from 13.4 per cent, new Bank of Spain data shows.

Loans that were at risk of not being repaid - mostly mortgages - reached 192.77 billion euros ($A286.18 billion) in March, the central bank said on Monday.

Spanish banks also seized almost 50,000 homes in 2013, 11.1 per cent more than in the previous year, data from the central bank showed.

Spanish banks are burdened by bad loans made during a decade-long property bubble that burst in 2008, tipping the nation into recession and throwing millions out of work.

Despite shoring up their balance sheets with a 41.3 billion-euro rescue loan from Spain's eurozone partners, the banks have struggled under stubbornly high bad-loan levels.

During the previous biggest economic crisis to hit Spain in the 1990s, such problematic loans peaked at 9.15 per cent in February 1994, a level which has been largely overtaken by recent figures.
