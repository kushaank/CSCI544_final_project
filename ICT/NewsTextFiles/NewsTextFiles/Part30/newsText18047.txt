
ST. LOUIS (KMOX) - The St. Louis Parks Director is facing questions about the safety of parks, as more park rangers are shifted to patrol Forest Park at the expense of neighborhood parks.

Parks Director Gary Bess says Forest Park is the biggest park in the city and deserves the best coverage. Of 3,000 acres total park land in the city, Forest Park has 1,400 acres.

“If you look at the way we distribute rangers, they’re distributed fairly equally based upon that acreage,” Bess says.

But Northside Alderman Antonio French says the plan endangers public safety.

French says the idea of roving park rangers is a joke. He wants at least two permanent park rangers each for O’Fallon and Fairground parks.

He says Forest Park Forever should come up with money to pay for its own security to free up park rangers who now are assigned to buildings in Forest Park.

Bess says he believes the roving rangers can handle the situation, and call police if there’s trouble.
