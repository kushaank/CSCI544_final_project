
LAUTOKA cane growers who have farms located on flat land and in low-lying areas have lost newly-planted cane and some farms remain inundated with floodwater after heavy rain pelted the Western Division on Saturday.

Lautoka Cane Producers Association executive manager Arvin Singh said funds had been allocated to address drainage issues and work was being done to clear debris and improve drainage on members' farms.

"Many farms have been affected by the heavy rain, especially those that have recently planted on flat land in low-lying areas and we will look at how best we can address this issue," Mr Singh said.

"We are using a portion of our Fairtrade funds to fund the drainage works being carried out and also to provide culverts to farmers."

Mr Singh acknowledged the assistance by the government through the Sugar Ministry but said the geographical challenge and widespread farms had made progress difficult.

"The government has come to us with equipment but because of the scope of the problem, they do not have enough to assist everyone at the same time."

The association has more than 5100 members.
