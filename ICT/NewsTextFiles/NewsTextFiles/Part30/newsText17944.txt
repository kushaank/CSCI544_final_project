
At Rs 11,500 for the dual-sim version, the Lumia 630 is a competent Windows Phone device.

Hence, when the Finnish company sold its devices business to US software giant Microsoft, which produces the Xbox and Surface product lines, it turned several heads.

The Lumia 630, the first Nokia-branded phone launched by Microsoft after the deal was inked, was bound to be subjected to serious scrutiny.

The dual-SIM version of the Lumia 630 is Nokia's first device to run the much-awaited Windows Phone 8.1.

The 630 is no exception although this time the shape is more flat and blocky than usual.

It's a clean rectangle with sides that taper towards the back, giving it a fairly easy grip. The rear bulges only slightly.

The Lumia 630 has a powerful processor, the trusty Qualcomm Snapdragon 400. It's a 1.2GHz quad-core system-on-a-chip (SoC) with integrated Adreno 305 graphics.

The SensorCore, as it's called, ties to the Bing Health and Fitness app that can act as a pedometer and activity tracker.

You get 8GB of built-in memory that is expandable up to 128GB with a microSD card.

The screen is 4.5 inches diagonally but has a low resolution of 480x854 pixels.

The biggest story, of course, is the latest Windows Phone version. Microsoft's update is fairly significant, with plenty of improvements.

The other visible change is, finally, the notification bar, named Action Centre. Just like in Android and iOS, you can swipe down from the top of the screen to an overlay that displays pending notifications.

The much-publicised background photo option works only with some photos if you arrange your Start screen tiles carefully.

We're impressed with most of the improvements we have seen in Windows Phone 8.1 but there is still work to be done. At Rs 11,500 for the dual-sim version, the Lumia 630 is a competent Windows Phone device - a good option for someone who doesn't want to buy a smartphone running on the Android operating system.
