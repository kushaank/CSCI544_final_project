
A G.H.Mumm champagne pop-up shop has opened in the Aelia Duty Free store at Nice Côte d'Azur Airport in time for Sunday’s Monaco Grand Prix.

The premium brand space is open to travellers until June 30, and the store focuses on G.H.Mumm’s innovative and educative platform, which covers every ritual linked with champagne.

This includes from choosing the perfect wine to the appropriate temperatures and the best food pairings, to help travellers discover the perfect way to enjoy champagne during the summer sporting season and beyond.

Brand visibility is being achieved via eye-catching product glorifiers, which showcase a key selection of the G.H.Mumm range, including Cordon Rouge, Rosé, Blanc de Blancs Mumm de Cramant and Mumm Cordon Rouge twin pack.

Playing cards, emblazoned with the 100 protocols are available for consumers to interact with, while iPads installed with the G.H.Mumm champagne protocoles app, encourage travellers to share the brand’s rituals on social media platforms.

Jenny Shipton, marketing director at Pernod Ricard Travel Retail Europe, explains: “G.H.Mumm is always associated with celebration and toasting to momentous occasions, which is why we’ve timed our pop-up activation to coincide with the Monaco Grand Prix.
