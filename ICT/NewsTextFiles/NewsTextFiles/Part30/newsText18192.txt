
Alex Neil was facing demands last night that he make an urgent statement to parliament over his role in a health shake-up in his own constituency.

The health secretary has been under increasing pressure for the past week over his part in keeping open two hospital wards at Monklands Hospital in his Airdrie and Shotts constituency. Mr Neil not only reversed the decision taken by his predecessor, Nicola Sturgeon, but over-ruled the local health board.

It also became clear over the weekend that the two wards, which were used by mental health patients, contained asbestos.
