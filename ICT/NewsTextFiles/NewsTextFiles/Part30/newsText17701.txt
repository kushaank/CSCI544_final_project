
TEHRAN (FNA)- Arsenal will hand Arsene Wenger a £24m contract and £100m transfer kitty in the next 72 hours after he ended the club’s nine-year trophy drought.

Arsen Wenger will sign a three-year deal worth in the region of £8million-per-season in wages, Daily Mail reported.

And he will be given the biggest transfer budget in Arsenal history to help him win the Premier League title for the first time since 2004.

Wenger has been re-invigorated after watching his team beat Hull City in Saturday’s FA Cup final - the fifth time he has lifted the trophy as Arsenal boss - and will now stay at the Emirates.

Asked if the new deal would be signed soon, he said: "Yes - because I go to Brazil on June 10."

The length of the deal is viewed as a significant statement of unwavering support from the club’s hierarchy. And they will also give Wenger the all clear to go on an unprecedented spending spree this summer to ensure the club build upon their FA Cup success.

Wenger will have £100m to spend on transfers and wages. His priority is to convince full-back Bacary Sagna and keeper Lukasz Fabianski to stay at the club, but the Arsenal manager has also identified three key areas to strengthen this summer. He wants a new striker, a holding centre-midfielder and a right-back.

Bayern Munich’s Mario Mandzukic and Real Madrid’s Karim Benzema are among Wenger’s top striker targets.

Bayer Leverkusen’s Lars Bender and Southampton’s Morgan Schneiderlin are midfielders who have been watched extensively by the Gunners scouts, while Toulouse’s Serge Aurier, Southampton’s Calum Chambers and Manchester City’s Micah Richards are right-back options should Sagna depart.

"First we have to wait for Sagna and see what he will do - also Fabianski. After we have to bring in two to three players to strengthen the squad, that’s for sure," Wenger said.
