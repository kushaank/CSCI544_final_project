
Let the countdown to wedding day begin!

Kim Kardashian and Kanye West arrived in Paris over the weekend and were spotted shopping at Balenciaga, Colette and Miu Miu before breaking for lunch at L'Avenue on the city's famous  Champs-Élysées .

Kim opted to go braless in a revealing peach top and tight suede skirt for the couple's day out.

Kim, 33, and Kanye, 36, are reportedly getting married this weekend at the Forte di Belvedere in Florence, Italy. The two are said to be spending approximately 300,000 euros ($400,000) to rent the 16th century fortress for the weekend. It's thought that guests will attend a dinner in Paris and then be flown to Italy to attend the ceremony.

Kim's younger brother Rob Kardashian , who hasn't been seen in several weeks and has reportedly been battling depression, was spotted at LAX airport in Los Angeles the other day with his mom Kris Jenner, most likely en route to Europe for his sister's wedding.

Kim shared a lovely shot of Paris earlier today, and it seems the reality star and her rapper beau could not have picked a better time of year to tie the knot.

Kim captioned the pic: "Beautiful day in Paris"
