THE world’s only full-size replica of a Bible created by the Venerable Bede has returned to its spiritual home.

A 2060 page copy of the Codex Amiatinus is on display at Bede’s World, in Jarrow, for the first time since the illustrated manuscript left England in the 8th Century.

The original volume is the only one of three full versions of the Bible, created by Bede at his Monkwearmouth-Jarrow monastery in 692AD, to survive.

Weighing more than 34 kilograms (75lbs), an estimated 515 calf hides were required to provide the vellum for the Codex Amiatinus compared to the 130 animals used for the Lindisfarne Gospels.

The volume on show is an exact replica created in Italy in 2000, down to imperfections including a hole in part of the vellum and signs of the original monks running out of ink on a manuscript page.

The Bible went on public display yesterday (Sunday, May 18) and will remain until September.

From July 19, Bede’s World will host ‘Banners of the North’, an array of treasures on loan from the British Museum including a 15th Century gold signet ring dating from the Wars of the Roses and a gold pendant depicting St George slaying the dragon.

Also on loan is the earliest surviving copy of the 12th Century Boldon Book, a North-East version of the Domesday Book, which will go on display at South Shields Museum and Art Gallery.

The manuscript is more than 700 years old and includes some of the earliest references and information about villages in the region.
