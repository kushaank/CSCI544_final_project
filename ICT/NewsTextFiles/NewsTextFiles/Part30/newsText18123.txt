
Another week, another Andrew McConnell restaurant opening. Two weeks ago it was Supernormal in Flinders Lane. This time it's his French-inspired wine bar, Luxembourg, in the former Golden Fields site in St Kilda.

McConnell has gone into business with chef Chris Watson, who headed  the kitchen at McConnell's flagship , Cutler & Co in Fitzroy. The  pair have refined the aesthetic, whitewashing the walls and adding  shelves of books and bottles and an enormous pair of deer antlers.  Tables are clothed, the Thonet chairs are padded and the room is softer  than its playful Asian predecessor.

Watson hopes it will become a place where people drop in for a full  dining experience or just a glass of wine.  It will have a daily happy  hour called ''le cinq a sept'' (5pm to 7pm), initially with half-price  oysters and Aperol Spritz on offer. The menu  is a mix of traditional  and modern French dishes.

The wine bar is open for lunch   Friday to Sunday and dinner  Tuesday to Sunday.
