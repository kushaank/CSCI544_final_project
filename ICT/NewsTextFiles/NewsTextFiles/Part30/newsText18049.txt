
The Hertz office at LAX (a grungy airport I was surprised to find) is worthless.  We wasted a precious hour because they did not have a convertible I ordered. Somehow one materialized but I'm still unsure that we aren't toting drugs inside the seats or under the hood.  The car is dirty, missing the passenger vanity mirror (as in wires hanging off) and it has New Jersey license plates. WTF?!

Sadly, no time for a French dipped sandwich at Philippes.  After the hertz debacle, we had timed tour tickets at the Warner brothers studio to get to and got stuck in the famous LA traffic.

Jet lag was setting in but we wanted to hit some more things on the list... So I was on to Pinks for an overrated chili dog, then off to find the Hollywood sign... Drive through Beverly Hills...stroll along Venice Beach boardwalk. We did all of that with limited gusto.  And with a whimper we crashed for the night at our hotel overlooking the Santa Monica Pier.

5 hours of driving up the coast awaits us tomorrow. With some sleep I'm hoping for a much better day.

Miss you all.
