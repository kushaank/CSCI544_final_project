
Advocates for the independence of West Papua say a UN decolonisation committee should visit the Indonesian province.

The United Nations Special Committee on Decolonisation is meeting in Fiji this week.

The Australia West Papua Association says the committee should go on a fact finding mission to investigate how the West Papuan people have fared under Indonesian rule.

The AWPA's Joe Collins says the committee visited New Caledonia in March and it should also now visit West Papua.

He says it is an accepted fact that the so called act of free choice in 1969 was a farce and the UN has a moral responsibility to the West Papuans for the betrayal of a people.

Joe Collins said it is time for the UN to revisit the whole question of the handover of West Papua to Indonesia 51 years ago.
