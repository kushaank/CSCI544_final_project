
THE Salvation Army Church believes churches play an important role in the battle against HIV/ AIDS.

This was the main message delivered by the church divisional commander Iliesa Cola at the AIDS candlelight memorial service in Suva on Sunday.

"Churches need to break the silence on HIV and speak up," Mr Cola said.

"We need to have courage to reach out to people.

"At times we have rejected those who are infected and the church needs to reflect that love for Jesus and they need that love.

"Let us take time out and work with our brothers and sisters to help them in society and support each other.

"It's about time we talk and share about this issue. Let us give joy to our brothers and sisters who are infected."

Reverend James Bhagwan, who represented the Fiji Council of Churches, said the organisation invited all its members to have some sort of consideration for those lives lost from HIV/AIDS.

"It's important that churches create safe spaces for people who come from vulnerable communities, people who live with HIV," Mr Bhagwan said.

"We know that stigma continues to be an issue and discrimination and fear exist in our communities and society so the churches call is for unconditional love."
