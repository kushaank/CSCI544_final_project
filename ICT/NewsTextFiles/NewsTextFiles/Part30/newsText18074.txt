
The Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea (IFREMER) of France noted a 'marked improvement' of the bluefin tuna stock in the Mediterranean Sea.

Following the imposition of measures to preserve the species, the proliferation of specimens encourages fishermen with purse seine to start the fishing season on 26 May.

According to IFREMER researcher Sylvain Bonhommeau, "All the signals are positive."

The observations performed by scientists from the Institute determined that there are three times more juvenile tuna banks than 10 years ago.

Furthermore, they noted "a large increase in the number of caught specimens" in the trap net fishery located off the coast of Spain and Morocco, reported Yahoo Finance.

"Many negative images on tuna have become history," pointed out the director of the fishermen's cooperative of SÃ¨te, Bertrand Wendling.

Currently, "large numbers of bluefin tuna" are easily captured, the leader added.

Good prospects for the next season are the result of strict control measures adopted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) between 2007 and 2009.

The Committee also agreed to the drastic reduction of fishing quotas, limiting the campaign to one month per year for purse seine and catch sizes.

To Bonhommeau, the observed improvement is "so recent that it is difficult to predict whether it is a long-term trend."
