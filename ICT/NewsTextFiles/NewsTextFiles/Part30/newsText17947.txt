
AIRPORTS Fiji Limited wants to encourage optimal competition between retailers and commercial businesses given the opportunity to operate out of the Nadi International Airport.

AFL executive chairman Faiz Khan said this was the objective of the authority when it came to providing essential commercial services to the thousands of people who enter or depart the airport.

"Optimal level of competition means that you have to provide choices and you've got to provide as much competition as possible," he said.

"That does not necessarily mean, in my view, that we will have ten players or ten banks over here.

"So what is that optimal number of banks that should be over here, for example.

"Should it be one or should it be two?"

Mr Khan explained that fact would be determined by the demand and commercial features of the airport.

"It depends on the commercial aspects and it depends on a number of issues.

"It does not necessarily mean that you're going to see ten banks in the airport."

The executive chairman recently welcomed the Bank of South Pacific's recent opening of its 110th ATM at the airport.
