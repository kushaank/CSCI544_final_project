
Russian MPs intend to ban changing of citizenship of adopted Russian kids over fears that NGOs specializing in adoptions might send children to the United States via third countries.

â€œDespite the fact that we are no longer sending orphans for   adoption to US families, the USA has not given up on its policy   of purchases of children. If we fail to impose a legal ban on the   shipping of children across the ocean, they will transport them   through third countries,â€� State Duma deputy Yevgeniy   Fyodorov (United Russia) has told the mass circulation daily,   Izvestia.

â€œThe growing number of registered foreign NGOs [specializing   in adoptions] is a direct proof that the transit of Russian   children to the United States is growing,â€� the politician   added.

According to the Justice Ministry, after Russia introduced the so   called Dima Yakovlev law â€“ the legislative ban on adoption of   Russian children by US citizens or by proxy of US organizations â€“   four NGOs specializing in adoptions have been registered in the   country â€“ three Italian and one American, bringing the total   number of such groups to 53.

Fyodorov reported that in connection with this fact he and other   Russian MPs had prepared a set of amendments to the current   adoptions ban that would restrict the transfer of Russian   children from adoptees to other families. The MP also proposes a   ban on renouncing Russian citizenship for an adopted orphan until   the child comes of age.

Russian officials intend to switch the adoption practices so that   they are regulated by intergovernmental agreements between Russia   and other nations. Presently there are only two such agreements â€“   with Italy and France, and an agreement with Spain is expected to   be signed soon. However, adoption in other countries is still   allowed, with the exception of the United States and also   countries that allow same sex marriage.

One of the recently registered Italian NGOs strongly refuted the   allegations that its purpose was to organize the orphansâ€™ transit   to the United States. The executive director of the Associazione   Adozioni Alfabeto group added that his organization intended to   continue Russian operations and was not involved in any conflict   between Russia and Europe.

At the same time, a number of Canadian NGOs specializing in   adoptions admitted that if Russia introduces the new ban they   would have to wrap up their operations in the country. A   representative of the World View Adoption Association group, Anna   Chukanova, told Izvestia that her Canadian bosses were reluctant   to maintain the Russian office as they were convinced that the   Canadian authorities would not sign any guarantees that adopted   kids from Russia would not end up in a same sex family.

Russian authorities imposed a complete ban on adoptions of   Russian children in the US on January 1, 2013, in reply to US law   enforcersâ€™ extreme reluctance to cooperate in cases of   maltreatment and even murder of Russian children by their   adoptive US parents. The law was named after Dima Yakovlev - a   two-year old Russian boy who died in July 2008 after his adoptive   father left him locked in a car for eight hours in hot weather.   The father was tried for manslaughter, but was acquitted, which   caused a wave of outrage among Russian diplomats, mass media and   the public.

In February 2013, Russia also banned the adoption of Russian   children by same-sex couples, as well as by unmarried citizens of   countries where same-sex marriage is legal.

Critics of these moves, both in Russia and abroad claim that the   restrictions would deprive many Russian kids of a chance to find   a family, and that many victims were disabled or sick children,   with little chance of adoption at home.

The Russian authorities replied that the country should not rely   on foreign aid in this issue and introduced a national program of   aiding domestic adoptions, which included simplified conditions   for would-be adoptees, state aid and tax breaks to families with   adopted children.

In December 2013, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev told reporters   that in the first nine months of the year the number of kids who   found new families inside the country grew by 5,000 compared to   the whole of 2012.
