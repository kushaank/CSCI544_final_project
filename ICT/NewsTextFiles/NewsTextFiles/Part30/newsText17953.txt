
MELBOURNE: A  Fiji-born teenager in  New Zealand has sought compensation and an  apology from the organizers of a  beauty pageant after she was declared winner but later told she was mistaken for "another Indian girl".

Synthia Nath, 19, participated in the 'Face of Beauty International' and had won the contest for 'Miss Globe International', the New Zealand Herald reported.

Nath claimed that when she called the organizers to find out the details of her prize -a trip to Turkey next month, she was told to raise $3,000 to cover the expenses of her trip.

When Nath told them that that she did not have the money, an organizer said that there had been a mistake in announcing the winner.

Nath then claimed that she was told that she was apparently confused with 'Loriza Latif', another Indian contestant, which they said was "honest mistake" because the pair "look alike".

An organizer told her that "I messed up the name somehow and it was another Indian girl that should have won."

Nath, originally from Fiji, said her reputation has been tarnished by the mistake and now she is seeking compensation for the competition entry fee and $420 for the 10 tickets she sold.
