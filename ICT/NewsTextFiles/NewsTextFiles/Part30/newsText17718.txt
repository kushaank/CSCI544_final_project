
JCI Residential began building Seville on 4th Street in June 2013 and finished it in April, a construction process that took less time than going through the city's development review hoops. Click on the photo to see more images of the East Austin project.

Seville on 4th Street, a new apartment community in the heart of East Austin, began welcoming its first tenants May 1 and already is 82 percent leased.

JCI Residential purchased the empty block at Navasota and East Fourth streets about five years ago and held on to it, watching to see what the market would do. Goll and partner Sam Kumar considered a small office project but settled on apartments with 27 units that would take advantage of natural light and views of the downtown skyline.

The units are small â€” all studio and one-bedroom apartments ranging in size from 720 square feet to 890 square feet. Rents start at $1,200 a month and top out at $1,550 for an average rate of $1.60 square feet, quite a bit less than some new downtown units which are going for $3 per square foot .

JCI Residential is a sister company of JCI Hospitality and JCI Senior Living. All three companies were spun off from Journeyman Construction, which handles all the contracting.

The companies are building a variety of projects from two hotels in downtown Austin â€” Hotel Indigo and Holiday Inn Express â€” to a senior living facility in Southwest Austin.
