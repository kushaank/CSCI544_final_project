
Pamela Anderson revealed traumatic childhood experiences of rape and sexual abuse on Friday at the Cannes Film Festival in France. She was there to promote the Pamela Anderson Foundation, a nonprofit organization devoted to protecting animal rights. She revealed that she was sexually abused as a child, raped at the age of 12, and later gang-raped by a boyfriend and six of his friends.

There to launch her new charity, Anderson said, “I feel now might be the time to reveal a few of my most painful memories. At the risk of over-exposing myself, again, or being inappropriate, again, I thought I might share with you why I am doing this,” The Independent reports.

Anderson stated that a female babysitter molested her between the ages of 6 and 10. When she was 12 years old, she was raped by a 25-year-old man. Anderson said that the man “decided he would teach me backgammon, which led to a back massage, which led into rape,” Time reports.

Anderson also revealed that she was gang-raped by an ex-boyfriend and six of his friends. She then went on to give a reason for discussing her brutal past. Although she had lost faith in humans, she was saved by her love of animals.

Anderson stated, “My loyalty remained with the animal kingdom and I vowed to protect them and only them.” Anderson’s new charity wishes to protect the environment, human rights and animal rights.
