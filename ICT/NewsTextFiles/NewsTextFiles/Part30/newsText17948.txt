
THERE is no excuse for assault and any man or person abusing their partner or another should be taken to task.

Speaking at a Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) consultation workshop in Labasa yesterday, workshop legal consultant Sera Karuru said there was no room for abuse whether it be mental or physical abuse.

Ms Karuru said CEDAW recognised the rights of women to be in safe and harm-free environments.

"Women in Fiji sometimes sweep issues of abuse under the carpet, choosing to remain silent over the issue but those that are aware of such abuses have an onus to report them," she said.

"Police have a no-drop policy case for domestic abuse cases and all women are entitled to their safety.

"Neighbours and witnesses of such forms of abuses are duty-bound to report the matter to their nearest police station if they are aware of it."

Ms Karuru said people in Fiji sometimes held the view of "minding their own business" and that the abuse of someone else was not their business.

"We all have an onus to report instances where our neighbours and friends' lives are being threatened or abused to ensure the cycle of abuse is stopped right away."

The workshop was part of a consultation forum to put together a report based on the successful implementation of the convention in the country.
