
IMMIGRANTS who come to live in Britain need to learn to speak English and to "respect our way of life", Culture Secretary Sajid Javid has said.

Mr Javid, the son of Pakistani immigrants and the first Asian Secretary of State, said people were entitled to expect that immigrants made a contribution to society.

"People want Britain to have more control over its borders, and I think they are right," he told The Sunday Telegraph.

Too right!

I lived and worked in Asia for a while a few years back. Learning the language of the country I lived in was great as it opened up new avenues and enabled me to appreciate the country and its culture much more.
