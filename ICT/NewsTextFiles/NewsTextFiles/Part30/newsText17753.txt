News reports indicate that the musician’s grand-daughter Assisi Jackson, 21, has given birth to a daughter.

Few details are known at the moment as it is believed that Ms Jackson, who lives in Cornwall with chef boyfriend Alex Key, 25, may have signed an exclusive magazine deal.

The new addition comes just weeks before Assisi’s mother Jade Jagger, 42, is due to give birth to her third child.

Sir Mick, who has seven children and four grandchildren, is preparing to go back on tour with his Rolling Stones bandmates following the tour being postponed two months ago.

The tour came to an abrupt stop when Jagger’s partner, L’Wren Scott, was found dead in her New York apartment on March 17. The fashion designer had taken her own life.

The Rolling Stones are set to perform in Norway on May 26.
