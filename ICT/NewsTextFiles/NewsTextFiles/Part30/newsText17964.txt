
His Excellency the President Ratu Epeli Nailatikau has commended the work undertaken by the Fijian Embassy in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to boost relations between the two countries.

The President is on his way to the Middle East to visit Fijian troops serving there and made a stop in the Emirates. His brief stop to the UAE allowed him to pay an official visit today to the Fijian embassy in Abu Dhabi.

He commended the work carried out at the mission since its establishment in 2012 and highlighted its position in providing consular assistance to Fijians living in the Gulf region or the Middle East. He reminded Embassy officials on the role of the Embassy as a point of contact and assistance for Fijians living there.

Since it’s opening, the embassy has actively worked to strengthen its presence in the Emirates. Accredited to more than 13 countries in the region as well as major global bodies such as the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council, the presence of the embassy has intensified Fiji’s relations with neighboring countries and regional bodies. This includes the permanent accreditation to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).  Fiji’s Ambassador to the UAE is the Permanent Representative to the IRENA.

Meanwhile, the President was hosted to a reception by the Fijian community residing in Abu Dhabi, led by Fiji’s Ambassador H.E Robin Nair. This reception provided an opportunity for the President to brief Fijians living there on the latest developments taking place in Fiji; in particular the electoral developments and the scheduled election in September this year.
