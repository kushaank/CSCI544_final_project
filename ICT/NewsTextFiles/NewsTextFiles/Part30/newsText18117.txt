
Head of "Lebanese Forces" party Samir Geagea announced that former Lebanese PM Saad al-Hariri suggested during their Sunday meeting in Paris the head of the Change and Reform Parliamentary bloc MP Michel Aoun as a consensus candidate to the presidential elections.

Geagea said that Aoun cannot be a consensus candidate due to his (Aoun's) previous practices and cooperation with Hezbollah.

scum whatever it takes.
