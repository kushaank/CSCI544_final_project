
Members of Parliament (MP’s) have been showing their support for Deaf Awareness Week this week by attending bite-sized training sessions to understand the impact of deafness on people in their constituency and improve communications skills.

MP’s attended the sessions, which were delivered by HearFirst, a national award winning workplace training and consultancy company specialising in delivering Deaf, disability and British Sign Language (BSL) training.  The company was joined by fellow UK Council on Deafness (UKCoD) member, Sign Health at the event to help them promote their work to MP’s.

The sessions were championed by Jake Berry, MP for Rossendale and Darwen to improve the understanding of the different types of deafness by highlighting the methods of communication used by deaf, deafened, deafblind and hard of hearing people, such as sign language and lipreading.

In 2012, HearFirst was awarded a contract to supply deaf awareness training to staff at the House of Commons and the company has organised a series of bite-sized training sessions for MP’s in the lead up to Deaf Awareness Week.

The event helped MP’s to improve their knowledge of deafness, broaden their understanding by meeting a range of people who are deaf and working and learn about the role and support that key organisations such as HearFirst and Sign Health can provide within their constituencies.

Julie Ryder, Director and Founder of HearFirst, said: “The aim of the training sessions was to raise awareness of deafness and provide MP’s with the knowledge and skills to help them make real changes for Deaf people within their constituencies.

Now in its eleventh year, Deaf Awareness Week is co-ordinated by the UKCoD.  Hundreds of deaf charities and organisations across the UK will participate in a series of national and local events during the week.
