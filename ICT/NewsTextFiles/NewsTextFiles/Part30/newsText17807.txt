
Both parties stand at 24 seats in the poll from Maurice de Hond. The D66 is one seat up from last week.

The VVD has 22 seats in front of the CDA (21) and the SP (20). The PvdA follows with ten seats and the ChristenUnie has eight. GroenLinks has seven seats, the Party for Animals five. SGP and 50Plus both have four seats and the Pirate Party has one.

PvdA-leader Diederik Samsom said that the European elections are not about the PVV or the D66, who are leading the polls, but about who will become the biggest fraction in the European Parliament. A tight race is being run between the Christian democrats and the social democrats.

Sigmar Gabriel, leader of the social democratic SPD party and vice chancellor and minister of Economy and Energy, was a guest at the meeting and spoke out against the parties that placeÂ people and countries against each other, and wants to close the borders again. He said that Europe must keep cooperating, especially keeping history in mind.
