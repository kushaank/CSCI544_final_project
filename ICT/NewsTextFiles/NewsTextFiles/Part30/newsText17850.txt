
Increased fiscal powers for Holyrood will be guaranteed by the Liberal Democrats in any coalition negotiations that follow the 2015 UK general election, provided Scots vote No to independence in September, according to Nick Clegg.

In a speech in Edinburgh today to the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, Clegg also said that LibDem fiscal devolution plans would raise the proportion of Scottish tax revenues controlled by a devolved Holyrood from 30% under the 2012 Scotland Act provisions to more than 50%.

It follows a weekend BBC interview in which Clegg said that if Scots voted to reject independence at the referendum on September 18, his party would ‘act as guarantors’ of greater fiscal devolution in future UK coalition negotiations.

He said that increased devolution was ‘inevitable’ if Scotland remained within the UK and suggested that the LibDems could broker a consensus between other parties – including the Scottish National Party – after a referendum No vote.
