
SANTA CLARITA (CBSLA.com) — A suspect was arrested Monday in a BB gun attack that left a young woman injured.

Cory Flenory, 28, was arrested on mayhem charges around 8 a.m. at his Valencia home, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.

According to the LASD, Flenory got into an argument with the 22-year-old female victim while driving Saturday night in the parking lot of a Santa Clarita Walmart.

The victim’s family told KCAL9’s Jeff Nguyen the woman and her boyfriend were leaving the store in her car when a man in a Mazda SUV bumped them. They say the man followed them to the intersection of The Old Road and Pico Canyon Road, where he shot at them from his car.

The victim’s sister, who wished to be identified only as Jessica, said she felt “shock and disbelief” over the alleged incident, and revealed doctors had to remove foreign material from her sister’s eye during a surgery at a Torrance hospital.

“It looked like glass…  They know it was a bullet because it shot her through the window. It went through the window in the car and went through her eye,” she said.

LASD Deputy Josh Dubin told KCAL9 deputies were able to recover the BB gun they believe was used.

Flenory, who detectives say was on parole at the time of the alleged attack, is meanwhile being held without bail.

He is expected to appear in court Wednesday morning.
