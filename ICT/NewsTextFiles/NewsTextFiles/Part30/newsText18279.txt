IT is a journey that has been made many times for charity - but never before in a straight line.

A team of adventurers is now attempting to be the first to travel in a beeline from Land's End to John O'Groats. The unusual feat will see the foursome spend 100 hours in a kayak, eight days on bikes and up to 20 hours on foot as they travel the ambitious route, avoiding many of the usual roads associated with such a challenge.

The Beeline Britain team, including double-amputee paralympian Captain Nick Beighton and Tori James, the youngest British woman to summit Everest, will travel through some of the most extreme coastal, mountain and urban environments in the UK. The group are already under way and hope to raise more than Â£20,000 for Blesma, the Limbless Veterans Charity.

Captain Beighton, who lost both his legs when he was struck by an IED in Afghanistan, said: "Life is about pushing yourself to find new limits to what you can achieve and endure.

"Having no legs is the driving factor behind everything I do. It not an excuse to do nothing, but a reason to do more."
