
THE High Court in Suva has heard that a complainant in a rape case that happened seven years ago is still undergoing surgical operations after the incident.

DPP lawyer Amelia Vavadakua told the court last Friday that she had received a phone call from a medical officer at the CWM Hospital informing her that the complainant is recovering at the recovery ward after another operation.

The court heard that the complainant who is now 14 years old was eight years old at the time of the incident.

The rape happened in Navua.

High Court judge Justice Paul Madigan said it was unacceptable that the incident which happened seven years ago had not been dealt with.

He asked Ms Vavadakua to explain why prosecution did not try to extradite the matter to the High Court from the Magistrates Court as soon as charges were laid.

Ms Vavadakua explained the matter was being handled by various magistrates before which was why it had not been dealt with accordingly.
