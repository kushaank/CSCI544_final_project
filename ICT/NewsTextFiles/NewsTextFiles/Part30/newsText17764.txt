More people must to be able to stand on their own two feet and feel the satisfaction of supporting themselves through their own work. This lays the foundations for our common welfare and helps to narrow the gaps in society.

More companies must start up, stay and grow in Sweden. All children must be able to enjoy a secure childhood and to attend schools that give them the opportunity to develop. Our higher education and research must be world-class. Medical and social care must be characterised by accessibility, quality and choice. People should not fear becoming a victim of  violence and crime. Sweden must take responsibility for combating poverty and the environmental and climate threats at global level.
