The project, which calls for the demolition of four historic buildings, is facing opposition from preservationists, nearby residents and critics of the property owner, who say he's already proven himself a bad landlord.

Mayor Mitch Landrieu is also against the project as long as it requires the razing of historic structures, said his spokesman Tyler Gamble.

The developer, however, remains committed to the plan, promising to create 300 new permanent jobs, add 373 new hotel rooms to the city's booming tourism sector and create a modern architectural landmark.

After facing an expected setback before the CBD Historic District Landmarks Commission, which denied the developers' application for demolition in March, the next stop is before the New Orleans City Council on Thursday (May 22).

The council is set to consider an appeal of the commission's ruling.

The project, spearheaded by Kishore "Mike" Motwani and Minneapolis developer Shaun O'Laughlin with Wischermann Partners, would occupy nearly two-thirds of a block bordered by Canal, Tchoupitoulas, Common and Magazine streets.

The six buildings that would be slated for demolition to make way for the tower are all owned by or under contract with Motwani. They are in various states of disrepair and unoccupied except for first floor businesses that include a massage parlor, t-shirt shop, liquor store and sushi restaurant.

Motwani and his partners say that it would be cost-prohibitive to renovate and incorporate the structures into the proposed development. The city would benefit more by tearing them down and approving construction of a hotel that would add much-needed rooms to accommodate the city's growing tourism sector, they say.

Opponents of the development say that the only reason the buildings are largely vacant and in such poor condition is that Motwani allowed them to deteriorate. The city would be better served, they say, by a plan that would preserve the historic structures and blend them into the burgeoning residential community that surrounds the site.

The demolition of historic buildings is only one of the potential roadblocks for the project. The plans also are running up against height restrictions.

The project includes a 255-foot-tall building with a spire that tops out at 350 feet, more than 280 feet above the area's 70-foot height limit. The spire would be illuminated and serve as a beacon to what O'Laughlin calls "one of the most important intersections in the city," where the French Quarter, CBD and the Convention Center corridor all come together.

The 373-room hotel with 168 on-site parking spaces would include two Marriott-branded properties stacked on top of each other--the Residence Inn for extended stay travelers and the SpringHill Suites for more affordable rooms. The first floor will feature a "signature national brand" restaurant with sidewalk seating.

The $100 million project would create 200 new jobs at the hotel, 100 in the restaurant, and up to 500 construction jobs, said O'Laughlin, who in 2003 renovated seven buildings as part of the Country Inn and Suites project on Magazine Street.

O'Laughlin said that he was working with Motwani on another plan for the Canal Street site that included a much taller tower with a hotel, condominiums and rental units but the project was scrapped after Hurricane Katrina.

If the council approves the demolition of the four buildings, the developers would then need to go before the City Planning Commission for height waiver. They would also have to hold more neighborhood meetings and go back to the CBD historic commission for further design review.

O'Laughlin said he took the historic commission's denial in stride, saying it's the agency's core mission to protect historic structures.

"I don't know how you can get something approved with them if you want to remove a building. You'll almost always be denied," he said. "This is a project about and for the street of Canal; that's what's it's geared to and designed for, bringing great brands to the city. It's truly a greater improvement to what's there now. It's completely under utilized."

Ed Mathes with Mathes Brierre, the project's architects, said at the March CBD historic commission hearing that "many cities would give their eyeteeth for somebody from outside the city to come spend $100 million in their city. We have long had the reputation for not doing that."

He said this project is unique for Canal Street because one person owns all of the properties, removing a significant obstacle.

"(The) DDD right now is trying to develop the second, third, fourth floors in some cases into residential units above the commercial property," Mathes said at the hearing. "It has not happened because you cannot get the property owners in this city that abut each other ... to agree on the time of day."

In rejecting the developers request for demolition, the CBD historic commission determined that four of the six buildings the developer wants to demolish are historic, in good condition and not in imminent danger of collapse and that their architectural design, craftsmanship and the materials used would be difficult to reproduce.

"The tourists who would be accommodated by this new facility to a large degree come to enjoy the authentic and unique architecture of the city," the commission's Architectural Review Committee stated. "It is not appropriate to demolish architectural inventory in order to create new buildings that purport to celebrate what was removed."

The developer has not offered any alternatives to demolition or ways to incorporate the existing buildings into the project, the commission stated.

Some of the loudest voices against the hotel project come from those who say the landowner, Motwani, is a bad landlord.

"(Motwani) has been completely and totally unresponsive to the suggestions of the HDLC and the neighborhood associations," said Maury Herman who lives in a neighboring building. "He has been completely uncompromising."

The four buildings Motwani and O'Laughlin want to tear down are historically significant because they represent the last remnants of a once-thriving multi-cultural commercial district on lower Canal Street, according to historian William D. Reeves.

The building at 105 Tchoupitoulas was originally owned by two African-American businessmen, Julien Clovis and Joseph Dumas. The property was later used as the Speake and McCreary grocery store where a child named John Rowlands worked after immigrating as an orphan to the United States from Liverpool, England. He was adopted by Henry Hope Stanley, renamed Henry Morton Stanley and went on to become a famous explorer.

Paul Tulane, the namesake of Tulane Avenue and Tulane University, built the structure at 109 Tchoupitoulas in 1840.

The building at 422 Canal St. was built in the 1860s and modified in the 1880s by notable architect James Freret who added the fifth floor and created the current faÃ§ade.

The commission approved the demolition of the buildings at 103 Tchoupitoulas St. and 408 Canal St.

One of Herman's biggest issues with the project is the speed at which it is progressing and what he describes as the backwards nature of its movement through the city agencies.

Before the council approves the demolition of four historic buildings, the developers should be forced to secure approval for all other aspects of the project including its design, engineering, zoning and the height waiver while performing economic, environmental and traffic impact studies, Herman said.

"I've seen a lot of major developments and I've never seen one like this that went to the council just to get conditional approval for the demolition of these buildings without having done a whole lot of other due diligence," Herman said. "On the merits I think this is just an awful proposal."

The fate of the project is in the hands of the City Council where, traditionally, councilmembers look to the colleague whose district in which the project arises.

Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell, whose district includes the CBD, remains noncommittal.

An emailed statement says, "I'm giving careful consideration to all angles of this proposal: from the residents' point of view, the administration's and the developer's perspectives and all of the historical preservation and zoning issues. As I've said before, the city needs balanced growth, which requires all government entities to really examine and determine the cost/benefit analysis for individual projects. Right now, I'm in the middle of that."

The Downtown Development District has "not taken a position (on the project) but is working with all parties to reach an amicable and successful conclusion," said DDD spokeswoman Devona Dolliole.

The project has also received criticism because of the participation of Motwani, often times referred to as the "T-shirt king of New Orleans" because he owns dozens of souvenir and novelty shops that some claim are hurting the historic character of the French Quarter.

The city cited Motwani more than 30 times over the past decade for neglect and blight violations involving the four historic properties on Canal and Tchoupitoulas streets.

Motwani has previously been cited for illegally installing automatic teller machines in the facades of several historic buildings throughout the CBD. He also agreed, along with his father, Chandru, to pay $294,295 for denying overtime pay to 132 workers. The U.S. Labor Department hit him with a $2.3 million fine for violations of federal labor laws.

If the council approves his appeal of the commission's demolition denial, Motwani's latest venture would move one step closer toward becoming a reality. If the council rejects his plea, then Motwani might be forced to figure out a way to bring the long-neglected historic buildings back to life.
