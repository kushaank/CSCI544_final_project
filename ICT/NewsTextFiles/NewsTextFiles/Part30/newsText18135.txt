
Watch the first teaser trailer now.

Well, that looks cray. The first trailer for Sony Pictures Classics’ upcoming biopic (which has its world premiere May 19 at Cannes) “ Foxcatcher ” looks insane ratcheting up the tension to an almost unbearable degree in one minute alone. And if early reports are to be believed, the drama does not let up for the full 130 minute running time.

“Foxcatcher” is based on the real life story of an eccentric multi-millionaire, played by Steve Carell , who recruits wrestler Mark Schultz ( Channing Tatum ) to join a team training for the Seoul Olympics. Mark’s rivalry with his brother Dave ( Mark Ruffalo ) fuels an obsession from Carell’s character which ultimately goes in some very deadly directions.

Did we mention it looks crazy? It does.

“Foxcatcher” hits theaters on November 14.
