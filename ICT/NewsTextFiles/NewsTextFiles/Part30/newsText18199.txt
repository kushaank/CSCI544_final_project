
Passengers have been warned of train delays this morning after late-running engineering works disrupted southwest London services to and from London Victoria and London Bridge.

Passengers on Southern Railway were told to expect delays, alterations and cancellations on routes to Balham, Clapham Junction, Croydon, Crystal Palace, Mitcham and Sutton.

One passenger waiting at West Croydon said: "We've been told to expect delays of up to 20 minutes, but not much more than that."
