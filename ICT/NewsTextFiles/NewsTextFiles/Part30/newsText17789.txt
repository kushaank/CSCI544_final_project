A Ukrainian truck driver is dead and at least seven people are missing after a landslide caused by a melting glacier in Georgia.

The tragedy occurred in Georgia's Dariali Gorge in the Kazbegi district near the Russian border on May 17.

Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili said in a written statement on May 19 that the massive landslide also damaged a pipeline supplying Russian gas to Armenia.

In the last two days, Georgian rescue teams have managed to evacuate more than 220 people -- including citizens of Belarus, Kazakhstan, Turkey, and Ukraine -- who were trapped on a major highway connecting Georgia with Russia's North Caucasus.

In his statement, Garibashvili also thanked Russian authorities for offering equipment to help respond to the disaster.
