• During the quarter it was announced that Henrik Bunge has been        appointed the new CEO of Björn Borg. Henrik Bunge will assume the        position on August 1, 2014.

“This year’s first quarter was mixed. We saw increases in revenue, gross        profit margin and operating margin, mainly because of shipment delays        from the previous quarter until the first quarter of 2014. Better        profitability in the Swedish wholesaling operations and a strong        performance by our operations in England and Finland contributed        positively at the same time that sales of our spring and summer        collections decreased compared with the previous year,” said Henrik        Fischer, Acting CEO.
