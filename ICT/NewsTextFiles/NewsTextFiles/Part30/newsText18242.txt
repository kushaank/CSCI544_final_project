
Two divers from Kent pleaded guilty on Thursday, May 15th to not declaring valuable items from shipwrecks off the UK coast.

David Knight and Edward Huzzey, both from Sandgate, admitted to 19 offences between them, contrary to section 236 and section 237 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995.

Items were taken from shipwrecks off the Kent coast, with the first known objects removed in 2001. The shipwrecks targeted included German submarines from World War I and an unknown 200 year old wreck carrying English East India Company cargo.

The items included 8 bronze cannons, 3 propellers from German submarines, lead and tin ingots, along with various other artefacts. The combined value of the items is estimated to be over £250,000.

The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said that based on diary entries, Knight and Huzzey used explosives and sophisticated cutting equipment to free wreck material.

Sentencing has been scheduled for 2 July 2014.

“Our message is clear: all wreck material found within or brought within UK territorial waters must be reported to the Receiver of Wreck. It is not a case of ‘finders keepers’.

By reporting wreck material you are giving the rightful owner the opportunity to have their property returned and you may be adding important information to the historic record.

Legitimate finders are likely to be entitled to a salvage award, but those who don’t declare items are breaking the law and could find themselves facing hefty fines.

“The investigation has highlighted the need to tackle heritage crime, wherever it occurs, so that the remains of our past remain part of our future.
