
NNA - Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea said on Monday that his meeting with former Premier Saad Hariri was over the presidential election deadline and the Lebanese crises in general.

Speaking from Paris during a press conference, Geagea said he had told Hariri that building relations with the Free Patriotic Movement was a good thing but MP General Michel Aoun was not a consensual candidate.

"March 14 will go to the session on Thursday and we call on the other team to go to the House of Representatives to vote for the candidate they want to elect," he said.
