
An episode of the hit sci-fi show Dr Who has just been filmed in the volcanic Canary island of Lanzarote.

The 55-strong team spent four days in the easterly Canary island filming scenes for an episode which will star the new 'doctor', Peter Capaldi.

It’s the second time the classic BBC drama has chosen Lanzarote’s outer-space appearance as the ideal set for one of its episodes, the first time being in 1984.

According to local authorities, the crew set up shop near the island’s Timanfaya and Volcanes Natural Parks, home to numerous volcanoes and sprawling lava fields.

"The fact that the BBC has chosen to film here will be good for the reputation of the island and will create tourism," the Canary Islands source told Spain's El Mundo newspaper.

Doctor Who, which first aired in the UK in 1963, is known in some Spanish-speaking countries as Doctor Misterio.

Capaldi’s predecessor, Matt Smith, played Doctor Who in a 2012 episode filmed in a desert in Spain's southern Almería province.

Scene from 1984 Doctor Who episode 'Land of Fire', also filmed in Lanzarote.
