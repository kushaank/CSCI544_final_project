After more than 10,000 years bison have successfully bred in the wild in the North of Spain, bringing hope to the conservation of this endangered species. “Pipa” and “Lipion” are the names of the offspring that are initiating a new era for these animals, thanks to a European program in collaboration with the Spanish Fund for the Protection of Wild Animals (FAPAS). The European bison is an extremely important species in Spain due to its repeated representation in the Paleolithic art of the caves in the north of the country. Currently only 4,000 specimens are left in the world, a fact that lead to the initiation of a European plan headed by the Conservation Centre of the European Bison in Spain (EBCC).

As part of this program , 16 animals were transferred from the Netherlands and Belgium to the north of Spain (Teverga, in the region of Asturias) during 2012, where they were released in accordance with a tactic called “hard release”. As per this method, the specimens were kept in a fenced area and continuously monitored, but no human help was provided in order to aid them in their survival. Only three of the bison died during these two years, all of them due to the hard winter experienced in the area. According to the scientists who lead the project, the hard rains washed out the nutrients from the plants the bison graze on, which caused weakness in the animals. These circumstances resulted in the sickness and death of three of the herd.

However, the project has so far been considered successful and now two bison calves have born in Asturias. The students of two schools in the area, who chose the names Pipa and Lipiom, named the baby bison in hopes of the continuation of the species. So far both animals show good health and optimal adaptation to the environment. Hopefully, more generations will follow them and these beautiful animals will live freely and out of danger in the Spanish plains once again, as they used to do some 30,000 years ago.
