
British millionaire Shoja Shojai suspected of confining women in his harem against their will in his mansion near Marbella was arrested in Spain, Tengrinews  reports citing  The Telegraph.

Iranian born Shojai lured young women by introducing himself as an oil tycoon and promising to arrange modeling and fashion industry opportunities for them. The women from Russia, Mongolia and Kazakhstan were studying in one of London’s fashion schools. There were a total of 9 women living with Shojai.
