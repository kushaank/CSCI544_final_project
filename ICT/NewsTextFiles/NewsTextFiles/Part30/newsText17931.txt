Forbes women Peta Constable and Donna Walsh have invited everyone to help local charity CanAssist next month, when they shave their heads for cancer.

The fundraiser will be held at the Forbes Inn on Saturday, June 7, when the girls are asking everyone to dig deep and donate to Forbes CanAssist, with all money raised staying in Forbes to help anyone who needs it.

Both Peta and Donna have had cancer touch their families, and figured this was their way to help families and patients fight the dreaded disease.

“We all know someone who has fought cancer or is fighting cancer,” said Donna Walsh.

The women ask anyone who wants to donate or to get involved to contact Kerry Dunstan of CanAssist on 0428-116-586.

David has donated his time to be part of the fundraiser.

Just Jayne’s hair stylists Cheryl Riddell and Richelle Finn are donating their time and expertise to shave the girl’s heads.

“So Forbes, be part of a great night for a great cause be at the Forbes Inn, Saturday, June 7,” Donna said.
