
The Ladder Creek farm site in Greeley County is the largest hog-growing facility in Kansas. These five barns are part of a 120-barn facility owned by Shawnee Mission-based Seaboard Farms. Each barn houses up to 1,100 pigs. The operation is located 12 miles north of Tribune on Highway 27 and east on 12 Mile Road. With its expansion permit approved it can legally have up to 396,000 pigs.

TRIBUNE  Even as Greeley County farmers are counting water by the drop, Seaboard Farms plans to increase production at its giant hog facility near here, bringing as many as 396,000 hogs to an exhausted area of the Ogallala Aquifer.

Seaboard Farms’ planned expansion at its Ladder Creek facility would make it the second largest of its kind in the country. The plan, approved by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment in March, has some local residents and environmentalists questioning its prudence and feasibility.

Samuelson said one farmer near the Ladder Creek site has only five years of groundwater left at his home and that several families have moved from their farms to town after their wells became too expensive to operate.

Groundwater Management District No. 1 is considering measures to cut irrigation in the area by as much as 20 percent in the coming months.

Even so, Seaboard’s new permit allows it to boost head counts at the Ladder Creek facility from 132,000 mature, 275-pound hogs to 198,000 mature hogs or 396,000 hogs still in growing stages. Increasing the number of hogs also will significantly increase the amount of water used at the facility.

Spokespeople for Seaboard did not return calls seeking comment.

In written testimony to the agency during the permit process, several local farmers asked KDHE to withhold approval of the expansion, citing the area’s lack of water.

But KDHE officials said that once water rights are established, water quantity is not a factor in the agency’s final permitting process.

Lane Letourneau, water appropriations program manager at the state Division of Water Resources, said Seaboard purchased existing rights in the area in compliance with state regulations.

Water levels in the aquifer dropped more than 51 inches in 2012 and have dropped 14 feet since 1996, according to the Kansas Geological Survey.

In January 2013, DWR granted Ladder Creek term permits allowing for the pumping of 158.61 million gallons of groundwater for industrial use over the course of the year.

But even with the permit, Ladder Creek has struggled to maintain the required water levels in its anaerobic sewage lagoons, which are designed to control odor and assist in breaking down manure generated by the hogs. The lagoons require the proper volume of water for the growth of bacteria to break down the waste and control odor.

In December 2012, KDHE officials gave the Ladder Creek site a variance from the permit when they did not meet the 14-foot water level requirements. At the time of inspection, Seaboard was told to submit a plan to bring the lagoons into compliance by Jan. 31, 2013.

Agency records show that Seaboard began filling the lagoons on Feb. 7, 2013, after submitting a plan to be compliant in six to eight months. The department approved.

Environmentalists said KDHE is not a particularly strong enforcer of its own regulations, noting that in Wichita County, the department allowed a smaller hog farm to operate more than three years on an expired permit from June 2008 to October 2011.

Current Kansas law doesn’t distinguish between smaller hog operations and one the size of the Ladder Creek facility. A facility with 10,000 hogs is held to the same standard as one with 198,000 mature hogs.

Medley said he saw no need to change the law to account for the added size of a facility such as Ladder Creek.

Beyond water quantity issues, some local residents and environmentalists question the site’s compliance with federal Clean Water Act guidelines, which are administered by KDHE. They said the expansion would make controlling odor from the site’s sewage lagoons more difficult.

At Ladder Creek, KDHE is trusting Seaboard to verify the number of hogs on site. The hog population correlates directly to the amount of waste generated and the odor produced.

Medley said the company also provides a report on the amount of waste generated at the facility.

“We can pretty much correlate the number on site with the waste generated. Unless we see a huge discrepancy in those numbers, we really don’t take the risk of going inside the barns and spreading disease,” he said.

Disease has become a major issue in confined swine operations. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, or PEDv, has spread to 27 states, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The USDA announced in April a program requiring the pork industry to report all cases of the virus and will be working closely with state agencies to stem its spread.

To keep the virus from entering the Ladder Creek site, Seaboard is among producers taking extra precautions, including postponing state inspections.

Medley said there was nothing unusual about that.

With water supply and quality issues growing in importance, Kansas policymakers should examine state laws to determine whether they are adequate to protect the public interest, said Roger McEowen, director at the Center for Agricultural Law and Taxation at Iowa State University.

McEowen isn’t convinced that they are.

He said Kansas might want to consider a water use system like Nebraska’s. There, he said, both surface and groundwater use are directly linked and water rights are given with stricter consideration of what consumption might mean to neighboring holders of water rights.
