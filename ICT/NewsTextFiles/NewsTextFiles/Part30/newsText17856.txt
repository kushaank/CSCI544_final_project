
European Patients’ Academy on Therapeutic Innovation (EUPATI) education and training program will educate patient advocates and the public to drive drug development.

DIA Europe, Middle East & Africa will play a major role in developing educational material to support patient advocates in Europe, thanks to a five-year initiative supported by the European Commission and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations. The initiative will help patients become champions for driving drug development as well as advisers in the regulatory and research arenas. Jytte Lyngvig, director of DIA Europe, Middle East & Africa, will discuss the initiative at “Patient Voice in Decision Making: How Are Regulators Making This Work?” during the DIA 2014 50th Annual Meeting on June 18 at 3:30 p.m. at the San Diego Convention Center.

Starting in September 2014, EUPATI will offer a comprehensive in-person and online training course, featuring more than 114 topics, for 100 selected patient advocates. A toolkit will be available online in seven languages in 2015 for the larger audience.

Chaired by Eric Gascho, assistant vice president of government affairs for the National Health Council, the panel will feature a discussion about the challenges regulators face when trying to bring the patient’s voice into the decision-making process, including hurdles in identifying individuals with particular diseases. The forum will also feature Isabelle Moulon, head of medical information for the European Medicines Agency, and James Valentine, an associate with Hyman, Phelps & McNamara, P.C., who specializes in health policy.
