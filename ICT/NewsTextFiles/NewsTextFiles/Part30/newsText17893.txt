The Turkish economy faces greater threats from problems in Europe than it does from an end to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s stimulus program, a prominent American economist has said.

“I think Turkey’s main fragility does not stem from the Fed, rather it is driven by the possibility of eurozone growth worsening,” Paul Bennett, the New York Stock Exchange’s chief economist, recently told daily Hürriyet.

The senior economist, who will lecture Turkish students at Istanbul’s Piri Reis University as a visitor scholar, has taken an unconventional approach to Turkey’s economic woes, as the U.S. Federal Reserve’s bond purchase tapering program has been seen as the main source of the weakness of the lira and the investment environment.

Bannett said the European Central Bank had not reduced its main policy interest rate as much as it can, enabling room for further maneuvering for the bank.

“This could turn into a right step for the bank, but it could also cause a delay in the economic recovery in Europe. The biggest risk for Turkey is the European real gross national product’s failure to gain an upward trend,” he said.

“This situation would hurt demand for Turkish goods and services,” he warned.

The Central Bank has a challenging task and needs to make an interest rate decision carefully, he said.
