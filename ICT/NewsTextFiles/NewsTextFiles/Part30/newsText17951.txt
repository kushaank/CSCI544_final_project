
The Grand Pacific Hotel in Suva is hoping to set a world record when it celebrates its 100th Anniversary on Friday.

The hotel is planning to bake the worldâ€™s largest Swiss Roll and treat guests to coffee and cake during an open house.

The hotel has been closed since 1992.

The management is now preparing to re-open next month the GPH next month at the completion of a two-year restoration programme.

The hotel was built by the Union Steamship Company in 1914 to serve the needs of passengers on its transpacific routes.

Its design was to make the passengers think they had never gone ashore.
