
Suva High Court Judge Justice Paul Madigan has refused two applications filed by Mahendra Chaudhry to stay or suspend his sentence.

Justice Madigan dismissed the applications saying a fine was issued, and not a prison term.

Justice Madigan says a suspended sentence can only be applied to prison sentence and not to fines and there is no provision to stay a sentence on a criminal case.

This now means the Labour Party Leader will still have to pay the $2 million fine imposed on him, for breaching the exchange control act.

Chaudhry has until June 30 to pay the fine or face imprisonment.

He will also surrender his foreign currency with an authorised reserve bank dealer, which can be a local banking institution.

Chaudhry was convicted and sentenced for breaching the Exchange Control Act.

The matter concerns funds that were collected for him and his family by supporters in India after the May 2000 coup where Chaudhry was ousted as prime minister and held hostage in parliament with his cabinet members.

Chaudhry has kept the money in accounts in Australia.
