
The new clinical information   system (CIS) introduced for the first time at Al Daayen Health Centre,   is coming in handy for the treatment of patients.

Alexandra Tarazi, executive director, health   information systems of CIS, at Primary Health Care Centre (PHCC), said   yesterday the system is helping in dispensing better care for every   patient.

Dr Fatima Yacoub Alali, manager, Al Daayen   Health Centre, said that the system is yielding positive results and   benefitting the patients very well.

The CIS is an initiative to have an integrated   personal electronic medical record (EMR) containing all the information   and medical history of each patient.

practitioner at Al Daayen.

Another advantage of the system is that it can   avoid any wrong medication. “When a medication is prescribed, the  system  alerts about the allergy for any medicine that the patient  suffers  from. This can help the physician or the pharmacist to avoid  the  medicine and prescribe other medicines,” Dr Fatima said.

“The system comes with the database that   specifies adverse reaction for any drugs. If there is an allergy noted   by the doctor or the nurse, it will automatically alert when prescribed   or dispensed. The doctor will get it at the time of prescribing it as   well the pharmacist at the time of dispensing it,” added Tarazi.

The CIS aims to improve the quality of care by   reducing adverse events such as prescription and medicines   administration errors, mis-recording of vital signs, symptoms, and   diagnosis, missing important information and repeated unnecessary tests.   The CIS also can improve patient experience, clinician effectiveness   and can make PHCC more efficient.

When all the hospitals and health centres in   the public sector are connected with the system, any patient record can   be accessed from any of these hospitals or health centres.
