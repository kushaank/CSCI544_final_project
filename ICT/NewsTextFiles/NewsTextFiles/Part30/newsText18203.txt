
A fresh stage in the Hillsborough Inquests begins today in which jurors will examine the layout of the Sheffield stadium.

After hearing what are described as "uncontroversial facts" and seeing a computer-generated 3D graphic of the ground, members of the jury will visit the location themselves on Friday.

The new phase in the proceedings follows a three-week adjournment which was granted after lawyers asked for more time to consider pathology evidence.

It begins with a presentation by a senior detective working for Operation Resolve - a separate police investigation into the causes of the 1989 disaster in which 96 people lost their lives.

Detective Superintendent Neil Malkin will cover a number of topics including previous inquiries in an address expected to last two days.
