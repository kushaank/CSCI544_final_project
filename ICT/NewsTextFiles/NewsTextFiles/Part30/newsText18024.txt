
TAYABAS CITY—The Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) on Thursday formally opened its provincial branch office at the Provincial Trade and Investment Center (PTIC) building in Barangay Isabang here, expecting a sales boost of its products and enhanced community support.

PCSO General Manager Jose Ferdinand Rojas II and members of the board of directors Betty Nantes and Mabel Mambo, Quezon Provincial Government Administrator Rommel Edano, First District Provincial Board Member Alona Obispo and Lucena Branch Manager Lady Elaine Gatdula led the blessing and inauguration rites of the office.  Nantes—whose husband, the late Gov. Raffy Nantes, had pushed for the construction of the building intended for the province’s trade and investment activities and promotion during his watch—thanked incumbent Gov. David Suarez for the use of the building by the PCSO.

The PTIC building has been lying idle since Suarez’s assumption to the provincial government in July 2010.

A memorandum of agreement between the provincial government and the PCSO allowed the use of the building by the latter for a lease amounting to P1 a year.

Edano thanked the PCSO for the P2-million endowment funds provided to the Quezon Medical Center and to other district hospitals of the province and for the conduct of social and medical services to the poor.

Through the PCSO, Nantes has been undertaking medical missions in various barangays, donating medicines and providing assistance for the hospitalizations of patients all over the province.

Rojas said the Small Town Lottery will continue as a regular program of the PCSO and will not be replaced yet by the suspended implementation of the proposed Loterya ng Bayan.

He said that other number games like Bingo Milyonaryo, which has been operating for a year already, will also continue.
