PARIS--Power group GDF Suez SA (GSZ.FR) Monday said it signed a deal to supply Japan's Tohoku Electric Power Co. (9506.TO) liquefied natural gas from the U.S., over a 20-year period.

The French group didn't disclose the financial details of the contract.

GDF Suez has been hit by the economic crisis in Europe, which has dented energy consumption, while its business model has been called into question by the push for renewables that has rendered some of its traditional power production facilities unprofitable. This has forced the group to resort to cost-savings and a new strategy, forcing it to turn to countries outside Europe and notably energy-hungry Asia.

The contract also underscores the new flexibility of global gas suppliers and notably the emergence of the U.S. as a gas exporter, following the shale gas boom that has considerably increased the country's gas resources.

GDF Suez will deliver 270,000 tons a year of LNG from 2018 to Tohoku, with gas liquefied at its Cameron LNG plant, located in Louisiana.

GDF Suez's partners in Cameron are Sempra LNG (SER), Mitsubishi Corp. (8058.TO), Mitsui & Co Ltd. (8031.TO) and NYK Line (9101.TO.

Cameron has received conditional approvals from the U.S. Department of Energy and partial agreement from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and will likely receive final approval within the course of this year, GDF Suez said.
