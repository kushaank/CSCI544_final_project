
New Chinese Film Talents Fund Forum enters second year.

“Bloody Far East” by Du Liang was awarded the top prize at the second edition of the Cannes market’s New Chinese Film Talents Fund Forum. Second prize went to “Alive” by Li Yang.

The Fund is intended to encourage and support promising young Chinese filmmakers in their understanding of the global cinema marketplace, of the commercial requirements of the film industry and of their approach of the international production business.

Eight film projects were selected to make pitches in Cannes, following a workshop involving French director Jean-Jacques Annaud was held in Beijing in late March.

Set in 1916, “Bloody Far East” follows a group of people from NE China who escape local fighting but get caught up in the Russian Civil War instead.
