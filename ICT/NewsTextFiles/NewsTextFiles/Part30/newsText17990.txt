Katie Walsh has paid tribute to Thousand Stars after the duo landed the Prix la Barka in France on Sunday.

Willie Mullins’ took his career earnings to almost £1 million with his fourth success in France as he defended his crown in the Grade Two highlight.

Walsh, who partnered the Irish raider to victory at the Cheltenham Festival, clearly holds the grey in the highest esteem and she has been singing the praises of her mount.

"He's an absolute star," the rider explained.

"The horse has been so good to me and everyone in the yard - he's one in a million.

"I didn't have a clue if I'd won or not, the track is wide and there's no rail to judge it against.

"I didn't want to think I'd won just in case I hadn't. Ruby came up and asked me and the other guy, but he didn't know either and you can imagine that mine and Ruby's French isn't very good so it took forever to find out.

"I won the County Hurdle on him back in 2010 and ever since then he's been incredible.

"Everyone thought he was coming to the end of his career but he won the last day at Fairyhouse and getting his head in front again really helped him.

"He loves it in France, he's won two Prix la Barkas and two French Champion Hurdles.

"He's the horse of a lifetime."
