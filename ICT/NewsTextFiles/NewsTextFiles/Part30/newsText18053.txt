
Pamela Anderson says she didn’t want to live, after being raped at the tender age of 12-years-old.

The former “Baywatch” star opened up during the Cannes Film Festival in France, saying, “I wanted off this Earth” after she was raped by one of her brother’s friends, then gang-raped by her first boyfriend and six others.

Anderson was in Cannes to launch one of her animal charities, but felt it was also a good time to talk about rape.

“I did not have an easy childhood,” she said. “I was molested from age 6 by a female babysitter.

Coincidentally, the Cannes event at which she revealed the rape was a backgammon tournament.

OK so I was feeling rally sorry for her until in the story she was playing backgammon and she told it all while AT a backgammon event.

I mean, that’s like saying you were raped while at McDonalds while being paid to promote McDonalds. It’s like they picked keywords for her to use.
