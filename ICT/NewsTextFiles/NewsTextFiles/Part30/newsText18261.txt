
Marks & Spencer boss Marc Bolland will get no bonus at all this year, for the first time since joining in 2010, because its annual figures will be poor.

The whole management team, from store level to the executive board, will miss out altogether on an annual bonus because Britain’s biggest clothing retailer has not reached the minimum threshold required.

Its army of 65,000 store staff may be unaffected because their bonus award is separate and discretionary.

The market consensus is that M&S will post full-year pre-tax profits of £615million, down from underlying pre-tax profits of £665.2million last year, which at the time was the lowest level since 2009.

The last time no bonus was awarded was in the financial year of 2008.

Last year the top team at Marks and Spencer received bonuses to the tune of £3million with Bolland pocketing £829,000 in cash and shares.

Today M&S (down 4.5p to 451p) will post a fall in annual profits for the third year in a row.

The disappointing update is also likely to be the first time rival Next will have overtaken M&S in terms of earnings.

Next recently reported full-year profits of £695million. Bolland has attempted to turn the business around after years of under investment in warehousing and computer systems.
