
THE standard of nursing services in the country is set to improve with the introduction of an elite nursing squad.

Explaining what this meant, director nursing Silina Waqa-Ledua said: "The Ministry of Health in its focus to continuously improve professionalism and ethics in the nursing practice has embarked in forming an elite nursing squad.

"The main objective to form such a group is to adequately train a cohort of nurses who will role model the concept of professionalism and ethical practice in the delivery of nursing services.

"This initiative is also envisaged to address patient complaints more effectively and allow for better response to patient needs."

To date, over 80 nurses have been trained in the three divisional hospitals and a number of sub-divisional hospitals in the country.

Mrs Waqa-Ledua said 25 nurses were trained for CWMH and the Central Division, 30 for Lautoka Hospital and the Western Division, and 25 for Labasa Hospital and the North.

She said the duration of training was three days on average.

"Its content basically covers professionalism and ethics, psychology, service excellence and customer care.

"These trained officers are deployed to various units and wards in the three divisional hospitals to influence their colleagues on these pertinent nursing concepts and are the major nursing support cohort to our overseas visiting teams.

"Resource personnel in the likes of former judge Nazhat Shameem, and former USP academic and psychologist Prof Roland Schultz, and service excellence trainer Shaukat Ali provided an outstanding prestige to the training package."

She added there was an intention to continue future trainings and evaluate its impact on nursing practice and patient care.
