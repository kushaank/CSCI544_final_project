
The Taiwan Stock Exchange stated that reporting of Q1 2014 financial statements by domestic listed companies (not including financial holding companies) has been completed as of May 15 2014. Overall revenue totaled NT$6.1 trillion or a 4.36% growth rate compared to NT$5.85 trillion in the same period last year. Pretax profit totaled NT$349.9 billion or an 8.97% growth rate compared to NT$321.1 billion in the same period last year. Of the 794 listed domestic companies (not including financial holding companies), the profit results of 459 outperformed the same period last year. These companies are primarily distributed in the semiconductor and optoelectronic industries.

Benefiting from the recovery of national economies in Europe and the U.S. driving the growth of Taiwan’s economy, the domestic economic monitoring index showed a stable growth “green light” for two consecutive months. This promoted a continued rally in the operating performance of domestic listed companies. In Q1 2014, 628 listed companies were profitable and, of these, 127 posted EPS in excess of NT$1. The overall profit picture of listed companies has improved with economic growth.

The Taiwan Stock Exchange stated, a large portion of the Q1 growth trend can be attributed to the semiconductor industry benefiting from increased DRAM, smartphone, and wafer applications demand.  The optoelectronic industry was affected by rebounding demand for panels of all sizes, leading to overall performance returning to profitability.
