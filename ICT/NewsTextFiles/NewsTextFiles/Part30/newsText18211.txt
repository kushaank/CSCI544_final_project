
HAMILTON, Bermuda, (CMC) — Premier Craig Cannonier remains the island's leader after surviving a three-hour emergency meeting between ruling One Bermuda Alliance (OBA) MPs and members of the OBA executive at the party's headquarters on Saturday over fresh fallout from a year-long affair dubbed 'Jetgate'.

Asked if 51-year-old Cannonier was still the premier of this British Overseas Territory, Deputy Premier Michael Dunkley replied: "Yes, he is."

Cannonier's survival came hours after a Government backbencher launched a withering attack on his handling of the affair and the Opposition Progressive Labour Party (PLP) called for Government heads to roll.

OBA Chairman Thad Hollis said after the meeting: "We had a great afternoon -- we're working together through some difficult issues. The inquiry is still ongoing. We will have further to say when it's concluded."

It has been confirmed that US developer Nathan Landow and other businessmen had contributed US$300,000 to the OBA's 2012 election campaign following a meeting with Cannonier after the premier and two of his Cabinet colleagues flew to Washington, DC on Landow's private jet last year.

Last Wednesday, Hollis, who announced the party would conduct a full investigation into Jetgate, said the OBA had not received US$300,000 from Landow and his associates.
