
The majority of European hedge fund managers that have set up business in recent years have been in the UK, according to data from Preqinâ€™s hedge fund analyst.

The UK is also the most prominent country in terms of hedge funds being launched in Europe, representing approximately 50% of all known European hedge fund launches in 2013 and 2014.

UK-based hedge fund managers have seen a net increase in assets under management (AUM) of around $57 billion between January 2013 and April 2014, in contrast to hedge fund managers based in France, Spain and Germany that have seen a net decrease in assets over the same time period.

The UK far eclipses other countries in Europe in terms of total hedge fund AUM, with $423 billion, ahead of Sweden ($34 billion), Switzerland ($31 billion), France ($20 billion) and Netherlands ($9 billion).
