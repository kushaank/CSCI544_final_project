VEYO, Washington County â€” A Santa Clara teenager was killed Sunday after an ATV crashed into the back of his dirt bike.

Austin Mcelyea, 17, was heading south on a dirt bike on Spanish Trail Drive, east of state Route 18, about 5:05 p.m. when the accident occurred, according to the Utah Highway Patrol. Makay Stephens, 27, of Veyo, was driving an ATV behind the bike.

Mcelyea and Stephens had just met and were riding with their mutual friend, according to UHP Sgt. Jake Hicks.

Mcelyea stopped near 115 North when his friend approached on an ATV. Stephens did not stop and hit the back tire of the boy's bike, the UHP reported. The impact launched the teen off the dirt bike and caused the ATV to roll.

The friend on the other ATV saw the crash and called for help.

Mcelyea was wearing a helmet but died from the impact, according to the UHP.

Responding officers arrested Stephens for investigation of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and automobile homicide. Stephens was booked into the Washington County Jail.
