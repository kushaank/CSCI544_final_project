
Around 250 corpses donated to medical science were being stored haphazardly in    a basement at the Madrid’s Complutense University after being used for    teaching purposes by anatomy students.

The gruesome discovery was revealed in Spain’s daily El Mundo newspaper on    Monday which published a graphic video showing shriveled and dissected    corpses piled up in a storeroom.

The newspaper described the discovery as “a scene from a horror film” and    reported that mummified bodies and parts of bodies were stored in conditions    without any means of identifying them.

Some of the bodies had been there for up to seven years, El Mundo reported.

Authorities at the university immediately launched an internal investigation    and said they would arrange with a funeral parlour to dispose of the bodies    in the coming days.

Spain has seen a marked increase in the number of people donating their bodies    to medical science since the start of the economic crisis, as a way for cash    strapped families to avoid the added financial burden of burial costs.

Madrid’s Complutense University confirmed that it receives around 50 donated    corpses a year that are used by the faculty of medicine for teaching    purposes.

The backlog of stored bodies was explained by university authorities as a    result of a staffing deficiency. “The member of staff charged with operating    the incinerating took early retirement in December and we haven’t been able    to fill the position because of a dispute with the union,” confirmed Ramon    Merida, the director of the anatomy department.

According to experts there is no legal framework concerning the disposal of    bodies donated to science beyond loose guidelines issued by Spain’s society    of anatomy.

In an official statement issued on Monday, the university insisted the images    obtained by El Mundo gave a “distorted view of reality”.
