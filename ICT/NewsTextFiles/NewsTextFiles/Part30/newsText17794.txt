The London imam Abu Hamza al-Masri was convicted of terrorism charges in New York on May 19.

The 56-year-old cleric was found guilty on all 11 counts he faced.

The defendant could face life in prison when sentenced in September.

Born Mustafa Kamel Mustafa,Â Abu Hamza was charged with trying to set up a terrorist training camp in the United States, and conspiring in a 1998 kidnapping of tourists in Yemen.

The four-week trial shined a spotlight on the preacher's controversial anti-Western statements, including his expressed support for the September 11, 2001, attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people.

It's the second high-profile terrorism conviction in federal court in New York City in three months.
