
But at these low volumes, you wonder about BlackBerry's viability. Consumer electronics is about scale.

Indonesians have long loved BlackBerry devices. When the company introduced a new phone two-and-half years ago, a crowd at shopping mall here became so unruly — in part because of a half-price offer for the first 1,000 buyers — that riot police were rushed in to stand by.

But even in Indonesia, BlackBerry's fortunes have changed. Last week, when the company started selling the Z3, a smartphone it made specifically for this market, consumers reacted with a collective shrug.

Nevertheless, the arrival of the Z3, a touchscreen device mainly notable for its budget-friendly $190 price, signals a new path for the struggling company. BlackBerry, like most phone-makers, has long contracted out the manufacturing of its phones, but the Z3 has also been designed and distributed by Foxconn Technology Group, the giant Taiwanese manufacturer.

BlackBerry's partnership with Foxconn, a company perhaps best known as a builder of iPhones and iPads, comes at a critical time for BlackBerry. Although sales of the company's devices have plummeted globally in recent years, the revenue from the phone business remains vital as John S. Chen, BlackBerry's chairman and chief executive, tries to shift the organization's focus to services and software.

By reaching a deal with Foxconn, Chen may have bought himself some time — if only a little.

"John Chen is just sustaining the handset business as he sorts out the way ahead," said Nick Spencer, an analyst with ABI Research in London.

While a four-hour tour of stores in Jakarta last week found no lines for, and relatively little shopper interest in, the phone, BlackBerry said in a blog post that the Z3 had attracted substantial interest and was sold out by Friday. It did not provide any sales figures.

In the last quarter, the company sold 1.3 million phones, compared with 6 million during the same period a year earlier.

But without the phone business, BlackBerry would be a significantly smaller company. During its last quarter, the ailing hardware business still generated 37% of BlackBerry's $976 million in revenue. A year earlier phones accounted for 61% of $2.7 billion in sales.

Two representatives for Foxconn declined to comment directly on its relationship with BlackBerry.

"We are focused on supporting our customers by providing services such as research and development, design, manufacturing and logistics support," the company said in a statement. "Moving up the value chain to provide a full suite of services has been our ongoing strategy."

Michael J Palma, an electronics manufacturing services analyst at IDC, said that by no longer sourcing parts by itself, BlackBerry will benefit from Foxconn's buying power while having a clearer idea of the final cost of handsets from the outset. "I think that's smart," he added.

Foxconn will also help BlackBerry shorten development cycles. BlackBerry has a long history of being slow to develop new products - BlackBerry 10, its most recent flagship product, was repeatedly delayed.

Chen said BlackBerry employees handled the software development for the Z3 and supervised Foxconn's work on its hardware in a process that took four months. "This is probably the fastest in the industry," he said.

Palma said FIH had since turned mainly to small phone companies in China for its business. "BlackBerry becomes a nice add-on," he added.

The Z3 may be less costly than previous BlackBerry offerings, but that may not be enough. Ruby Alamsyah, an independent technology analyst in Jakarta, said that Android phones now are sold in Indonesia for as little as the equivalent of $88, less than half the price of the Z3.

"I think the Z3, with the optional engraving of 'Jakarta' on the back, is only a marketing gimmick," he said. "They still want to recover in the Indonesian market but I don't think they'll get it back if the price is still higher than most cheap Androids.
