
An MP has demanded a commitment from government that no civil service jobs will be moved overseas.

Ministers said jobs must be in the most appropriate place but confirmed there are no plans for a move.

Shipley MP Philip Davies, pictured, who represents Burley-in-Wharfedale and Menston, said the move would be “a step too far”.

It is feared that 500 former civil servants will be made redundant and jobs outsourced.

Services Connected Ltd, a private company part owned by government and set up to run civil service back office functions, is expected to close offices across the country including one in Leeds.
