
Johannesburg : Google has reportedly said that it could take several weeks to figure a way to comply with a European Court of Justice ruling that it honour people’s requests to be “forgotten”, according to ANI.

According to News 24, the EU’s top court ruled on Tuesday that individuals have the right to ask the US internet giant to delete personal data and “be forgotten” online under certain circumstances when their personal data becomes outdated or inaccurate.

It was a contradiction of the advice of European Union advocate general who had said a year ago that search engines were not obligated to consider such requests.

While Google did not reveal details about the kind of requests received, online reports suggest that they include a paedophile and a politician who want references to their pasts to be deleted from the search site.

The decision has raised concerns about online censorship and how internet search works in various countries, the report added.

The case was brought by a Spanish man who complained that an auction notice of his repossessed home on Google’s search results had infringed his privacy, reports BBC.

Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales has criticised the ruling, calling it “astonishing” while advocates at The Index on Censorship said the court’s ruling “should send chills down the spine of everyone in the European Union who believes in the crucial importance of free expression and freedom of information”, according to BBC.

The ruling has also been deemed “disappointing” by Google according to reports, and Google has so far not released any information pertaining to the number of requests it has received about being “forgotten” by users.
