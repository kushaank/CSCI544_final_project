
This third instalment in the trilogy on Israeli women by actress Ronit Elkabetz and her brother Shlomi delivers everything a film should: as Ronit said, speaking from the stage of the Théâtre Croisette, the film shows something that has never been shown before (the inside of a Rabbi tribunal, in front of which Viviane Amsalem, played by the director, seeks to ask for a divorce – in Hebrew "gett"), causes laughter (unexpectedly), surprises at every corner and gives the viewer moments of suspense. And especially, this film, slowly but surely, manages to plunge spectators into the unsustainable situation in which Viviane is, as she extracts herself from it – indignant – more conscious than ever of a social and religious problem that touches the very heart of fundamental women’s rights.
