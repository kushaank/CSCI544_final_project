
PM draws distinction between falsehoods and 'factually correct information'

European Court of Justice ruled this week people had 'right to be forgotten'

People who want information about them removed from the internet could have to prove that it is inaccurate and not just damaging.

David Cameron believes there is a major difference between wanting lies taken down from the web and trying to ‘hide factually correct information’.

It follows a controversial ruling by the European Court of Justice which said people had the 'right to be forgotten' - and could therefore request for articles in Google search results be removed.

The government is still studying the details of the ruling to see how it can be implemented properly.
