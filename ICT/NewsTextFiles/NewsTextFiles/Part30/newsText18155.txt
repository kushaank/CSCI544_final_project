
Coastguard round up: Portland Coastguards search for missing man off French coast.

PORTLAND Coastguards took part in a search for a missing man off the French Coast on a busy day for the service.

The Portland Coastguard Rescue Helicopter helped French Coastguards in the search of a 26-year-old man.

They assisted in the search from 7.17am on May 18, after it was reported the man fell overboard from a tanker, registered in Cyprus, called Julia.

The tanker, a French helicopter, a Falcon aircraft and the R-106 helicopter from Portland all took part in the search, which was called off at 12.45pm when nothing was found.

At 12.20pm, a boat with six persons aboard was towed to the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy after it broke down in Portland Harbour.

The vessel was 300 yards away from the academy when it suffered engine failure, and was towed back to the sailing academy by a boat called Fortuneswell , after a call was made for assistance from Portland Coastguard.

A diver was then taken to the Hyperbaric Centre in Poole following advice from Portland Coastguard.

The diving club Aerial Diver asked for advice from the coastguard, after a diver made a rapid ascent to the surface, just before 5pm. They had placed the man on oxygen after his ascent and then took him to the centre in Poole by car.

Later in the evening at 6.05pm, Dorset Police requested coastguard assistance after concerns were raised for a missing 14-year-old girl on Hive Beach in Burton Bradstock.

As the coastguards were on their way, confirmation was received by the police that the girl had been found safe and well, and the coastguards stood down.
