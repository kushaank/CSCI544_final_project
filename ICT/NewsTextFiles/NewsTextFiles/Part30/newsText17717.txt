Madrid - A Russian man accused of being a mafia killer responsible for 33 murders in that country has been arrested in Spain, according to Spain's national police force, the Guardia Civil, on Monday.

The man, whose identity was not released, had been the subject of an international arrest warrant.

He was apprehended Friday in the north-eastern municipality of La Jonquera, in Catalania, near the French border.

French officials cooperated in the arrest, reported the Guardia Civil.

The man is believed to be a member of a criminal organisation that focuses on the illegal trade of weapons and explosives.

He came to the notice of police after he was spotted several times in Empuriabrava, on the Costa Brava, with an ethnic Russian woman who now lives in France.

He was followed and picked up when he tried to cross the border. Although he tried to use forged identity papers at the border, he was identified thanks to his fingerprints. His case has already been transferred to a judge in the national court in Madrid.
