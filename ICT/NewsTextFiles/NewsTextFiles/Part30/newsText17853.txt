
The latest directive by the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to ban all herbal medicines without registration or a product licence is likely to affect the Rs 850-crore annual sales of Indian herbal and Ayurvedic medicines in Europe.

The deadline for registration was April 30. It has since been deferred. The MHRA has warned people not to use a number of herbal medicines online such as the Indian-made Shwasa Sanjeevani for asthma, found to contain dexamethasone, a prescription-only medicine.

Ayurvedic drugmakers from India, under the Ayurvedic Drug Manufacturers' Association (ADMA), are protesting the ban. The body has approached the commerce ministry for resolution. The major challenge for registration is the MHRA’s fee, which ranges from ^10,000 (Rs 8 lakh) to ^50,000 (Rs 45 lakh).

Indian companies are yet to start registering their products and are waiting for an intervention by the ministry. Besides registration fees, the MHRA also requires traditional medicines to have been used in the European Union for 15 years.

Shashank Sandu, the treasurer of ADMA, said, "We are studying the notification. We have shared our concerns with the ministry. We have tried talking to MHRA, but it did not respond.

He said the European Ayurveda Medical Association had shared these concerns with their respective authorities.

“Traditional Chinese Medicines and Ayurveda traditionally use heavy metals and other toxic elements as ingredients. These include realgar (arsenic sulphide), cinnabaris (mercuric sulphide), calomelas (mercurous chloride), hydrargyri oxydum rubrum (red mercuric oxide). The current Chinese Pharmacopoeia includes 48 products containing at least one of these ingredients)," a notification from MHRA said.
