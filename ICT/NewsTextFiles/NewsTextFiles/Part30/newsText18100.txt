
Eva Longoria 's appearance at this year's Cannes Film Festival has been one of the best beauty highlights so far. As always, she looked stunning on the red carpet alongside her fellow L'Oréal Paris brand ambassadors.

Cannes is a very special red carpet event. It's always fun to be here with the energy, the people, the fans. It's just such a historic, prestigious red carpet . As a brand ambassador for L'Oréal, it's so nice to be here with all the global ambassadors because you get to see what beauty means in a global sense.

We see Aishwarya and Freida from India, then we see all the Asian ambassadors, then all the American ones and the Latin American ones and the Brazilian ones. It's always nice. So, this is a very special festival, particularly because we're with L'Oréal, and we get to see the diversity and colour within the brand.

Well, I don't prepare, the village prepares me!

This illusion takes a lot of magicians, what with the hair and makeup and nails and styling. It's a lot and I know I'm in good hands when I'm in Cannes because the goal of L'Oréal is to make sure we look great so I'm never worried!

Yeah, it's a full day of interviews and press and commercial shoots and photo shoots then we jump onto the red carpet then run off the red carpet.

No, it never feels like a holiday when I'm in Cannes because we work so much! I always say that this is the only time I get to see the beach is when I'm on this terrace! It is fun, but we definitely have a lot of work when we're here. So it's hectic but fun!

My next red carpet is going to be subtle. It's going to be a nude. It's not a beaded gown, it's a very simple jersey, very simple material. It's definitely going to be a different kind of look with a different hairstyle.

Stay tuned for more exclusive Cannes interviews and to see Eva's next red carpet look!
