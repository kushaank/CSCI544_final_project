
A 23-year-old man has admitted carrying out four “utterly horrifying” sexual assaults in and around Doncaster in the space of just over an over.

Natham Bradder of Springwell Lane, Balby, pleaded guilty at Sheffield Crown Court to rape, assault by penetration and two sexual assaults on February 23.

The four sexual offences were committed against woman aged 17 or 18 and started with an attack on a 17-year-old girl just off Cleveland Street at 1.50am.

Bradder then assaulted two 18-year-old girls who were walking together on St Sepulchre Gate in the town centre.

Just after 3am on Cedar Road in Balby, he grabbed and dragged a 17-year-old girl from the street, into an alleyway and onto a field where he then raped her. He will be sentenced on July 23.

Detective Constable Jo Bedford of South Yorkshire Police said: “Bradder’s actions that night were utterly horrifying and sickening; it is difficult to find the words to truly describe the gravity of his offending and the lasting impact it will have on the young women he attacked.
