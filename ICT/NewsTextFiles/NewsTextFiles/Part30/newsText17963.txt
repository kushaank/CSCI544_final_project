
Fiji's Sodelpa Party says it is a big concern that Fiji taxpayers will bear the cost of Monday's bumper edition of the Fiji Sun.

The five hundred plus page paper contained the names, addresses and signatures of more than 40 thousand supporters of the regime-backed Fiji First Party which is applying for registration.

The rules require parties to have at least five thousand signed up members, and a member list is among the party details which need to be published in the media.

Sodelpa's General Secretary, Pio Tabaiwalu, says when his party registered it pared down its list of supporters in order to keep publication costs down for the government.

"Why go overboard? It's really going to cost taxpayers in the vicinity of over $200,000 to pay for the advertisement in the daily and that is of real concern to us. And paid to a newspaper that in fact is a propaganda mouthpiece of this regime and that's another issue."
