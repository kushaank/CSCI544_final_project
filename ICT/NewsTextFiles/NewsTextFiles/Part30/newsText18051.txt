
The former Baywatch star revealed her “painful memoires” at the launch of the Pamela Anderson Foundation (PAF) on Friday.

The 46-year-old actress went on to say she had been “molested” as a child in her family home and raped at the age of 12.

Ms Anderson also said that a former boyfriend had arranged for her to be gang raped.

And she detailed her difficult home life, explaining that her father was an alcoholic, while her mother tried to hold down two jobs.

“My parents tried to keep me safe, but to me the world was not a safe place,” she said.

Ms Anderson said she had found solace from her traumatic childhood in her love for animals, which were “my only real friends until I had children”.

The Pamela Anderson Foundation is dedicated to human, animal and environmental rights. According to its official website, the charity aims to challenge communities and worldwide politics in a "provocative way”.

Ms Anderson’s husband Rick Saloman was in attendance at the event, as well as fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood.

More than $150,000 (£89,000) was raised for Ms Westwood’s chosen charity Cool Earth.
