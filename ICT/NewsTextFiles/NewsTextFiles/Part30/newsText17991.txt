
ITU presented the World Telecommunication and Information Society Award to three eminent personalities: Mr Paul Kagame, President of the Republic of Rwanda; Ms Park Geun-hye, President of the Republic of Korea; and Mr Carlos Slim, Chairman, Grupo Carso and President of the Carlos Slim Foundation. The three laureates were honoured in recognition of their leadership and dedication towards promoting ICTs and broadband connectivity as a means of achieving sustainable development.

World Telecommunication and Information Society Day 2014 marks the 149th anniversary of the establishment of ITU, which was founded in Paris on 17 May 1865. The theme for this year, ‘Broadband for Sustainable Development’ brings attention to the catalytic role of ICTs in securing smart solutions to achieve economic growth, social inclusion and environmental balance – the three pillars of sustainable development in the post-2015 era.

The Award ceremony was followed by a high-level round-table discussion on how broadband connectivity and ICTs can be harnessed to meet the post-2015 sustainable development agenda.

The World Telecommunication and Information Society Day ceremony ended with a call to celebrate ITU’s 150th anniversary in 2015.

“As ITU approaches its 150th anniversary next year, let us work together to bridge the digital divide and harness the power of technology to create a better and more sustainable future for all,” United Nation Secretary-General Mr Ban Ki-moon said.
