
Gerard Depardieu and Jacqueline Bisset arrive for the screening of the film "Welcome to New York",  Cannes  17 May 2014.

Dominique Strauss-Kahn is to take legal action over US director Abel Ferrara's film "Welcome to New York", which is inspired by the sex scandal that brought down the former IMF chief.

Speaking on Europe 1 , Strauss-Kahn's lawyer Jean Veil said that in the coming days he would "file suit for defamation over the accusations of rape and the insinuations made all throughout the movie"

Veil said DSK was "sickened and frightened by this film", which tells a story which is similar to the events which led to DSK's downfall in 2011.

Ferrara on Sunday denied the allegations of anti-Semitism, stating: "I hope not, I was brought up by Jewish women".

The scandal, which erupted with his arrest at the Sofitel hotel in New York, put an end to DSK's political ambitions in the 2012 French presidential elections.
