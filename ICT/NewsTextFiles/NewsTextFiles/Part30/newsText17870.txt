
The Cessna Citation M2 will make its European Business Aviation Convention and Exhibition debut this week.

Cessna Aircraft Co. and Beechcraft Corp. will display their wares under the Textron Aviation banner at the European Business Aviation Convention and Exhibition this week in Geneva, Switzerland.

The show will mark the first time the brands have been publicly displayed under a single banner since Textron Inc. closed on its purchase of Beechcraft.

The Hawker brand is also included in the Textron Aviation family.

The show, which runs from May 20-22, will feature the EBACE debut of Cessnaâ€™s Citation M2 and Sovereign+ models.

Textron Aviation said in a press release that it is working with the European Aviation Safety Agency on certification of both models.

Other aircraft to be displayed include Cessnaâ€™s Grand Caravan EX, and Citation CJ4 and XLS+ models.

Beechcraft products will include a Baron G58, King Air C90GTx, King Air 250 and Special Mission King Air 350ER.
