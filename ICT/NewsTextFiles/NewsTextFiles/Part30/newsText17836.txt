
NETHERLANDS - Vencomatic will have a number of products on display at the VIV Europe trade show this week, including one that has recently won an innovation prize at a Dutch symposium.

Q-Perch - a new way of controlling red mite and many more.

On Wednesday 21 May, the company's Poultry Specialist, Pieter de Gouw, will give a presentation about on-farm hatching; the right hatching environment for optimised broiler health.

VIV Europe, a European trade show based on the ‘Feed to Meat’ principle, will be held at the Jaarbeurs Utrecht complex in the Netherlands from Tuesday 20 May to Thursday 22 May.

Vencomatic Group hosted the 'Symposium for Higher Poultry Health' last week - an initiative from several Dutch companies that are related to the poultry industry.

Vencomatic Group won the ‘Poultry Innovation Award’ for X-Treck. Of the 230 visitors who voted for the product that they perceived to be the most innovative, 80 per cent chose X-Treck.

The company received the prize together with the Wingens brothers, with whom it developed and tested the X-Treck.

The X-Treck is a unique concept that enables on-farm hatching in traditional broiler houses. It provides an optimal start resulting in robust broilers and forms the basis for further profitability in broiler production.

Before the symposium, the organisation shot a video of all the nominees. In the video, you can see the X-Treck with the new option 'In-Cradle'; directly after hatching, chicks land on a synthetic surface where they recover from hatching before accessing the litter floor below.
