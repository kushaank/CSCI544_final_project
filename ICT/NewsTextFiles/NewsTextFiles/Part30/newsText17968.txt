
APPARENTLY the organisers of the Miss Globe New Zealand beauty pageant think all Indians look alike — even the drop-dead gorgeous ones.

Most people would not forget Synthia Nath’s stunning face in a hurry, let alone confuse her with another young woman but that’s exactly what happened to the Fijian-born teenager.

Two days after taking out the pageant’s top prize earlier this month, organisers told Ms Nath they had confused her with “another Indian girl”, Loriza Latif.

The 19-year-old science student was told she could still compete at next month’s Miss Globe International competition in Turkey — a trip which was supposed to have been part of her prize — but that she would have to come up within estimated $3000 to finance it.

Ms Nath, who paid $500 to enter the quest and another $500 for her dress, is now seeking compensation and an apology after organisers told her the mix-up was an “honest mistake” because the she and Ms Latif “look alike”.

“They told me, ‘Do you have $3000?’” Ms Nath told The New Zealand Herald.

Frustrated and hurt, Ms Nath then called Milagros Manuel, the CEO of pageant organisers Face of Beauty International Ltd to inform her of the situation.

“(Ms Manual) said, ‘Good, you don’t have the money. Give the crown and sash back, I have other girls lined up’,” Miss Nath said.

When she tried to return her crown and sash, organisers appeared to extend an olive branch — before slapping her in the face with it, sending an email stating: “You can keep it and pretend that you still are Miss Globe,” Ms Nath told The NZ Herald.

Ms Nath is seeking reimbursement for the entry fee and $420 for 10 tickets she sold — a condition of entry.

Ms Milagros confirmed what she had told Ms Nath about “an honest mistake” having been made because the two Indian contestants “looked alike”, in a statement to the paper..
