
On Monday afternoon a Norwegian Air flight was forced to return to Helsinki after a bird flew into one of the plane's engines. The 3:55pm flight had been bound for Oulu when a burning smell alerted in-flight personnel.

Norwegian's communications department said that the plane returned to Helsinki for safety checks because the firm's engineering department is located in the Finnish capital.

Earlier on Monday, national carrier Finnair announced that a long-haul flight from New York has been grounded in Halifax, Canada, until Tuesday due to engine failure.

This May there have also been several incidences of Finnish flights being grounded due to lightning strikes.
