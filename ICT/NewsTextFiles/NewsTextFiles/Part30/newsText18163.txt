
The United States Government has said that the Islamist fundamentalist sect, Boko Haram is not a branch of the global terrorist organization, Al Qaeda.

A statement by the US Consulate General in Lagos on Monday quoted the US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Wendy Sherman, as saying this on the sidelines of the summit hosted by French President Francois Hollande in Paris on Saturday.

Sherman who spoke to journalists alongside US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Linda Thomas-Greenfield; and the US State Department Counterterrorism Coordinator, Tina Kaidelow, said UN sanctions on Boko Haram could be as quick as this week.

He said, “Boko Haram is its own terrorist group, and the United States has designated Boko Haram as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation.  In this day and age, there is probably no terror group that does not have some links somehow, even if tenuous, to some other organization.  But for the most part, we treat Boko Haram as its own terror organization.

Sherman added that the US is committed to supporting the Nigerian government in ensuring that the girls are brought back alive.

According to him, the abducted schoolgirls have become “the girls of the world, not just of Nigeria” adding that all efforts were being put in place to ensure that the West Africa sub-region is not turned to a breeding ground for terror.
