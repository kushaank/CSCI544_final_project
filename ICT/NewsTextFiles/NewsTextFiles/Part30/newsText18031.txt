
France’s parliament on Monday postponed a debate on banning the use of corporal punishments, including spanking, by parents to an unspecified date.

Members of France’s Green Party accepted to delay their proposed amendment after pressure from allies in the Socialist-majority National Assembly.

"Legal guardians cannot use corporal punishment or physical violence against children," the amendment submitted by 16 Green lawmakers read.

MP François-Michel Lambert, who penned the amendment, said it would only bring France in line with European legislation that has already been adopted by 18 other countries.

French lawmakers are currently cobbling together a new, so-called Family Law bill that proponents say will give equal custody rights to separated mothers and father, but the move has come up against stiff opposition.

Laurence Rossignol, the French government ’s junior minister in charge of family affairs, said on Monday that the problems addressed in the “anti-spanking” amendment were “real,” but said she preferred to discuss them as part of more specific measures targeting child abuse.
