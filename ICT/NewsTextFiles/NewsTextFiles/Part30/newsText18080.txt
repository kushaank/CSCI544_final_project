
Despite what officials in Florence, Italy, say, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West aren't getting married in the city, but instead are saying "I do" at the Palace of Versailles in France.

Sources familiar with the wedding plans said the celebrity couple are getting hitched outside Paris.

The opulent Palace of Versailles is where three French kings lived, including the infamous Louis XIV and wife Marie Antoinette, who were executed during the French Revolution.

Meanwhile, a representative from the Florence mayor's office said Friday the couple had spent $411,000 to get married at the Belvedere fortress built by the Medici family in the 16th century.

West said he loves the city of Florence and believes the couple's daughter, North, was conceived there.
