
Deputy headteacher Gareth Williams, who pleaded guilty to charges of voyeurism and spying on children, will be sentenced today.

Williams arrived at Cardiff Crown Court on Monday to be sentenced.

The deputy headteacher of a Cardiff school pleaded guilty to 31 charges relating to voyeurism and the making and possession of indecent images of children, including some that involve spying on children as they went to the toilet.

In February the cityâ€™s Magistrates Court heard Williams, 47, of Rhiwbina in Cardiff, had admitted secretly filming children going to the toilet in a house for his own sexual gratification.

The 31 charges to which he has now pleaded guilty include nine of voyeurism, and a further 20 charges relate to the making of indecent images of children and two relate to the possession of 16,237 indecent photographs of children.
