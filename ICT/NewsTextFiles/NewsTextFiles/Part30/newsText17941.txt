
The successor of the current Consul Martti Ruokokoski is also his predecessor.

Pirkko M채kikokkila begins her work as Consul of Finland in Murmansk in August 2014. In this position she succeeds Martti Ruokokoski , who is going to return to Helsinki and will continue to work at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland.

Pirkko M채kikokkila has about 30 years of experience as an official of the Foreign Ministry of Finland. In her record there are such hot countries as Australia and Israel (for 8 years), and the countries of cool northern latitudes: Sweden, Lithuania, Canada. Ms M채kikokkila is also well informed of Russian issues: beside Murmansk she worked in St. Petersburg, and until arriving to Murmansk she will continue her work in Moscow.

"I want to further the good work that is being led by the Murmansk office," said Ms M채kikokkila at a recent press conference. "The most important tasks of the Consulate are: assisting Russian citizens in all questions of entering my country, maintaining of the consular work, supporting contacts between the Murmansk region and representatives of Finnish organizations, and promoting cultural relations and cooperation between the media of our countries. Apart of that, we have construction plans, as our consulate premises have become too small; now we have started design works on the construction of the new ones. The Consulate will continue to pay a significant attention to various cultural activities. Thus, in October 2014 the Finnish Film Week will be held for the 15th time in Murmansk."
