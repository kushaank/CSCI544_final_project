
FIJI has received half of the promised funds from the Papua New Guinea Government for the September 17 election.

This was confirmed by Elections Supervisor Mohammed Saneem who said this translated to about $F7million from the PNG Government.

"We can confirm that we have received the first trench of what was to be delivered by the PNG Government and we have the funds on board and definitely the funds for this (polling day recruitments) is already with us," Mr Saneem said at a press conference in Suva yesterday morning.

"We anticipate to have the full PNG money to us by next month and we have received the first half of it already, so we have $F7m â€” that's part of the funds PNG had promised."

Mr Saneem said the office received its funding from government as well.

"We have received the initial budget from the Fijian Government."

When asked about the costs for the refurbishment of the Elections Office, he said it was budgeted for.

"Refurbishment of this building was part of the funds we had requested from PNG and we are still continuing with refurbishments, but it will cost less than half a million dollars."
