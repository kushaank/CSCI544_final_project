
Brits enjoyed temperatures topping those in Spain and Greece today as the mini heatwave ended with the hottest day of the year.

Temperatures peaked at 26.3C in west London at 2.15pm where the Queen got the first look at this year’s Chelsea Flower Show before it opens to the public.

But a scattering of showers and thunderstorms are expected to move across the UK as the mercury falls from tomorrow.

As people returned to work, most of England and Wales enjoyed temperatures of at least 20C but parts of the western edge of the country saw downpours.

North-west Wales saw thunderstorms as did Devon and the Scottish highlands.

Showers are expected across the UK by the Bank Holiday weekend.

Met forecaster Dan Williams said: “It’s actually been warm across a large part of England and Wales with the top temperature in Gravesend.

“It started to cool off in the extreme west of the country including Cornwall and Devon and we also had some heavy rain in Wales.

“There will be some showers around but temperatures will take a while to go back down to what is average for the time of year.

The mini-May heatwave had seen 2014’s previous highest temperature recorded in London’s St James’s Park on Saturday at 24.5C.

London, the Midlands and north-west England saw the mercury in the mid-twenties today while Northern Ireland and parts of Scotland saw 12C to 14C.

Severe rain warnings have been issued tomorrow for Dumfries and Galloway, Cumbria, Lancashire and Yorkshire.
