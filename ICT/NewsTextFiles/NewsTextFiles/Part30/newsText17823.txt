
The Asia First news database goes back for four months to October 2013 (though in some cases we hold earlier new headlines). As each day passes we add to the timespan that the database covers. We currently hold approx. 100,000 stories and collect about 5,000 stories each day.

Asia First is focussed on financial intelligence, which for news means that which relates to finance, economics             macro and political events, the world of finance and investment and the major industry players and events. We select news sources carefully and monitor them to ensure quality. So we don’t endeavour to hold all possible news sources, just the most important, where available.

Our news is in the form of RSS feeds - the most common, free, syndicated content for public use. We do not “scrape” news from news providers’ websites without their consent. So when you search our news you are searching news headlines and short extracts of news, not whole articles. But you             can click on a link to view the full article on the providers website. This approach protects the rights of the news orgainsation in its content. As accessing full content is expensive it also enables us to offer this service without a charge for the content itself.
