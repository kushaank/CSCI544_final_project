
Martti Ruokokoski leaves the office of the Consul of Finland in the Murmansk region.

After five years of holding the office of Consul of the Murmansk branch of the Consulate General of Finland in St. Petersburg, Martti Ruokokoski has left this post to work in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland in Helsinki.

At the farewell press conference Mr. Ruokokoski summarized the results of his work in Murmansk, shared his impressions of the region, and expressed his expectations as to the Finnish-Russian cooperation.

According to Mr. Ruokokoski, his best achievement at the post was the opening of a visa center in Murmansk, while the most important unrealized aim remained the free border regime between the Murmansk region and Finland. "Today, the crisis in Ukraine postpones that decision," said Martti Ruokokoski. "I have long felt that between us no visa is needed, but we can take such decisions only in conjunction with the European Union. Anyway, Russia should always remember that Finland is its good neighbor."

Recent events on the world political arena afflicted both the mobility of northerners and consequently the economy of Finland. Since the beginning of 2014 Murmanskers are 25% less often applying for Finnish visas. And correspondingly there was registered a decline in activity of Russian investors in southeastern Finland.

Mr. Ruokokoski admitted that living in Murmansk has its pluses and minuses. The Consul said that the local climate is very difficult, especially for a man of his age. "The polar nights have become increasingly difficult to endure. On the other hand, you have wonderful people here. I'll miss my Murmansk friends, musicians with whom we played together," confessed Mr. Ruokokoski. Moreover, he promised to visit the capital of the Russian Arctic again with his music band "Back to USSR" for the celebration of the opening of the new Consulate building.
