
I have been driving through the “fracked counties” of Pennsylvania every few months for more than a decade to see family. I generally tend more toward the environmentalists’ line of thinking, but seeing the growth in these areas with my own eyes has made it difficult for me not to support fracking in New York.

The roads in Pennsylvania are in better condition, and there are improved buildings and new businesses everywhere you look, from gas stations and car dealerships to hotels and veterinary offices. New cars and pickup trucks are seen everywhere.

Even if this is a short-term boom, and even if the entire state doesn’t see an economic benefit, just the southern counties, it would be ridiculous to me that fracking is not allowed to come to New York. I just hope it’s not too late.
