
FAYETTE, Iowa (AP) - Meredith Lyons received her degree from Upper Iowa University and a wedding proposal from her boyfriend this weekend.

The Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier reports that Drew Hunt surprised Lyons at Saturday's commencement and popped the question right after Lyons finished shaking hands with her professors.

Lyons says it was cool having all the professors, fellow graduates and the crowd clapping and cheering for the couple after she accepted the proposal.

As a bonus, the substitute teacher has also been offered a full-time teaching job in Des Moines.
