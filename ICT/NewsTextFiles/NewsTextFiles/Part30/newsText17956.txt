
THE Marist-St John's Challenge held on Saturday in Levuka has been hailed a success.

The challenge involved rugby and triathlon competitions between Marist Brothers High School and St John's College Cawaci.

The rugby competition was played in the under-15, U16 and U17 grades with St John's winning the U15 and U17 grades.

In the triathlon competition, Kurt John's won the individual supersprint aquathon, which involved a 400-metre swim and a 2.5-kilometre run; Lui Pene finished second followed by Toma Pene and Esira Naikatolu on third and fourth places. In the team supersprint aquathon, Marist I finished on top followed by St John's I on second while Marist II and St John's II managed third and fourth places respectively.

"Marist and Saint John's used this event to prepare their teams that will be travelling to the Fiji International Triathlon event at Denarau next weekend," said Fiji Triathlon Association president Andrew Pene.

"The students, teachers, parents and old scholars of both schools are acknowledged for the success of this annual event which has grown." John Fox and Clyde King played key roles in co-ordinating the logistics for the event."
