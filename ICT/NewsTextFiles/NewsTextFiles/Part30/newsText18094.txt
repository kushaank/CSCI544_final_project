
Bollywood fashionista Sonam Kapoor created her magic at the 67th Cannes Film Festival red carpet in France on Sunday. The actress looked splendid in black Elie Saab couture gown when she walked the red carpet for the screening of "The Homesman" at the film festival.

As promised, Kapoor this time focused more on her hairstyle and makeup than accessories. She looked stunningly beautiful in black Elie Saab couture gown with faux bob hairstyle, which gave her 50s Hollywood diva's look.

With minimum makeup, the actress complimented her dress with chopard earrings. Kapoor attended the event as the brand ambassador of a cosmetic brand. Along with her Freida Pinto also attended the film festival as the brand ambassador.

On Sunday, Pinto walked the red carpet in a coral Oscar de la Renta strapless gown with gold detail complemented with metallic Jimmy Choos. The "Slumdog Millionaire" actress tied her hair in a sleek ponytail and had minimum makeup that completed her look.

The actress managed to grab eyeballs on Saturday when she dazzled on the red carpet wearing a feathered Michael Kors gown.

She looked gorgeous in skin color full skirt filled with feathers and sequins with side-parted wavy hair when she attended the screening of "Saint Laurent"

at the film festival.
