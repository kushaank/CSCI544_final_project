
Researchers in London have found a way to make matter from light, using high powered lasers. The idea behind the theory was first thought up 80 years ago by two physicists, who were to work later on creating the worldâ€™s first atomic bomb.

In 1934, US physicists Gregory Breit and John Wheeler worked out   that, on very rare occasions, two particles of light (photons)   could combine to produce an electron and a   positron. They were never able to carry out their theory in   practice as they believed it would be almost impossible.

â€œWhat was so surprising to us was the discovery of how we can   create matter directly from light using the technology that we   have today in the UK. As we are theorists we are now talking to   others who can use our ideas to undertake this landmark   experiment,â€� Rose continued.

They have managed to create a machine called a photon-photon   collider, which would turn light into matter. However, the type   of matter they are looking to create will be invisible to the   naked eye.

Oliver Pike, the lead researcher of the study , said that the experiment would be the   most elegant demonstration of Einstein's famous formula. "The   Breit-Wheeler process is the simplest way matter can be made from   light and one of the purest demonstrations of E=mc2," he   told The Guardian.

The process works something like this. Firstly, the scientists   would use an extremely powerful laser to speed up the electrons   to travel almost at the speed of light. These electrons would   then be fired at a slab of gold. This would create a beam of   photons, which are a billion times more powerful than visible   light.

The next stage sees a high energy laser being fired into a   hohlraum, which is the German for an â€˜empty room.â€™ As a   consequence, light as bright as that emitted by stars is produced   and in the final stage, the first beam of the photons is directed   towards the hohlraum, where the two streams collide, which forms   electrons and positrons.

The study has been published in the journal Nature Photonics.

The experiment would recreate a process that was important in the   first 100 seconds of the universe and that is also seen in gamma   ray bursts - the biggest explosions in the universe and one of   the greatest unsolved mysteries of physics.

I think it is because gold has one.electron in its outer shell... And an uneven number of protons making it easier to inject the proton. Just a guess.
