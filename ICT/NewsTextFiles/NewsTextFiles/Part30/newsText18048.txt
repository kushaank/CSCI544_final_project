
Judging by these pictures, we strongly suspect the sun has got its hat well and truly on in Paris.

With just days to go before their big day, reality star Kim Kardashian and her rapper beau Kanye West are making the most of their time in the city of love.

Whether it's grabbing an ice cream, heading to the gym, or strolling around the French streets, they've been spotted all over - but, until now, the kueen of flesh-baring has been well covered up (ish). Which is totally unlike her.

But on Monday Kim really let loose and decided to ditch her bra while opting for a gaping pale pink vest, which struggled to cover her ample cleavage. The busty bombshell teamed the risky look with a cream suede skirt and heels.

The power pair were snapped as they headed for lunch after shopping at the trendy concept store Colette on the luxury Rue Saint Honore.

Just the day before the stunning star was spotted tucking into an ice cream, while Kanye focused on keeping his perma-moody face totally composed.

According to reports, the pair will now actually tie the knot in Florence (no, we can't keep up either).

A source told Entertainment Tonight: "Kardashian and West’s guests will first attend a pre-wedding dinner in Paris and then the couple will fly their guests in private planes to Florence for the actual wedding ceremony."
