COLDWATER � As graduation nears for high school seniors, big decisions are being made about their futures.

While decisions like who to take to prom and what to do over summer break weigh heavily on the minds of many, the big question still remains: "Where are you going to college?"

May 1 was a big day across the state and nation in the college admissions process � it was the day by which seniors nationwide declared what they wanted to do with their futures and decided where they would go after high school.

Coldwater High School hosted its inaugural Decision Day on May 5 to celebrate the Senior Class of 2014 as they made the important decision to either attend college or trade school or enlist in the armed services. Students were asked to show support for their futures by wearing shirts representing the colleges or military branch they had chosen.

Teachers and staff were also asked to join in by doing the same. This year nearly half of the Senior Class and over half of the CHS staff participated in the Decision Day 2014 event at CHS.

"It is important that all students know college is possible for everyone," a news release from CHS said. "We believe by promoting a college-going mentality, students will help build a better future full of exciting possibilities. It is our hope that this celebration will continue to create a college-going culture within Coldwater High School, as well as within Coldwater Community Schools. We are encouraged by the many conversations that were generated by acknowledging students� commitment to a successful future and will strive to engage more underclassmen over the coming years through activities such as Decision Day 2014.

"Coldwater High School is extremely proud of our seniors and wishes everyone the best of luck in their postsecondary adventures," the release said.
