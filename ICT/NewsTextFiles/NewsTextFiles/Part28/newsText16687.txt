
Rector and Vice Chancellor (VC) of Stellenbosch University (SU), Professor Russel Botman said African universities need to work together to tackle challenges facing African education. He said this at the UB Council Chamber during his visit to University of Botswana on February 22, 2014.

Professor Botman’s visit was meant to find possible collaborations of African Universities in higher education, for the development of Africa. He invited African universities to continue exploring ways of working together to build African expertise by using new technologies to facilitate sustainable networks and life-long learning, endorsing the desirability of extending academic collaboration to make an impact on society.

Prof Botman stated that his university has set up the HOPE project, which creates sustainable solutions to some of South Africa and Africa’s most pressing challenges. He pointed out that the project is based mostly in teaching and learning, research and community interaction.

He went on to say that Botswana and Stellenbosch work together in the HOPE project to make an impact on society. He said that there are challenges which still exists in health, agriculture, security, governance, the military and leadership and emphasized that African universities need to work together to pursue research to find solutions to these problems.

Professor Botman expressed happiness that Stellenbosch University and the University of Botswana have already collaborated within the departments of Civil Engineering, Mathematics, Soil Science, Mechanical Engineering, Physics, Geology, Biological Science, and Law. He implored universities to find ways to get people with the right values to work in these collaborative efforts.
