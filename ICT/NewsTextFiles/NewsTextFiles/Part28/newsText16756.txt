
A serious concern in Jamaica’s tertiary institutions is the number of students who are unable to sit their exams or for whom graduation is delayed due to non-payment of their tuition fees.

Yanique Baker, 22, an accounting student at the University of the West Indies Western Jamaica Campus, faced this challenge and feared she would not be able to graduate in November this year.

Baker, though, was fortunate to receive a bursary from the university’s student assistance fund which helped her in satisfying her financial obligation to the university. The funds Baker received were raised from a bazaar hosted last year that netted over $300,000 to aid a number of students who had been unable to access their results or sit exams because their accounts were in arrears.

That initiative spurred Michele English, president and CEO of Columbus Communications in Jamaica, operators of Flow, to match the $300,000, taking the fund’s total to $600,000.

Being barred from exams is the distressing culmination of the financial challenges that tertiary students in Jamaica face daily. Other challenges, Baker said, include on-time payment of tuition fees, buying textbooks, finding taxi fare to get to school, medical bills, and securing a job.

In recognition of those difficulties, Flow decided to help with the staging of its Flow MoBay City Run 10K/5K Road Race.

The event has become a beacon of hope for tertiary students from western Jamaica.

“Students at WJC are privileged to apply for student assistant jobs on campus and also to the WJC student assistance fund, which opens at the beginning of every semester,” she said.

“I can attest to all these options. In my final year I was having a major challenge in finding the entire tuition fee at once. I made use of any opportunity I got and applied for any scholarship/bursary that was open. I received a loan from the UWI Mona Credit Union and also received a bursary from the Office of Student Financing. I also received a bursary from NCB, which is open to tertiary students every year,” Baker said.

After completing her undergraduate degree in November, Baker hopes to pursue her Master’s degree in either entrepreneurship or finance, but until then, she is eager to help students who find themselves in the position that she has been in.

Statisticians have said that the most competitive cities in the world boast a population of more than 50 per cent having tertiary education.

Education Minister Ronald Thwaites has articulated the vision of doubling the cohort of students in the country’s tertiary institutions from the current 40,000 by the year 2020.
