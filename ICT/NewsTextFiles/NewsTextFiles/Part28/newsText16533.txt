The driver of a blue Subaru SUV was taken to New Hanover Regional Medical Center with life-threatening injuries after a collision Monday afternoon with a Brunswick County school bus, said Brian Watts, Brunswick County's emergency management director.

The driver of the SUV, who was not identified, was among 10 people injured in the accident, Watts said. The driver was going to be airlifted to the hospital, but was taken by ambulance instead for reasons that weren't immediately clear, Watts said.

The driver of the school bus also was taken to NHRMC in Wilmington for a trauma check and eight students were taken to Dosher Memorial Hospital in Southport with minor injuries, Watts said.

The accident happened about 4 p.m. at the intersection of N.C. 211 and Midway Road.

Jessica Swencki, a Brunswick County Schools spokeswoman, said the bus was transporting students from South Brunswick High School and Middle Schools. Students who weren't injured in the accident were returned to South Brunswick High School for their parents to pick them up.

The bus involved in the accident was Number 252, Swencki said.

Among responding agencies to the accident were N.C. Highway Patrol, Oak Island Police Department, St. James Fire Department, the Brunswick County Sheriff's Office and Brunswick County EMS.
