
FRENCHTOWN, NJ – At the regional semi-finals for the New Jersey Solar Sprints youth engineering contest Green Brook’s middle school students won seven prizes and are sending three teams to the state finals in Florham Park on May 28.

The students advanced to the regional contest after winning the Green Brook Middle School Junior Solar Sprints on April 25.  The competing students are all in the district's Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) science program. Maggie Silver, the GATE director, said the event is the highlight of the year for the program.

Each team was given basic kits to build their car around, including a solar panel, battery pack and small motor.  The cars were required to meet certain criteria, including that most materials should be recycled and the car had to be able to carry an empty aluminum can.

The Junior Solar Sprints are sponsored by TransOptions to encourage middle school students to get involved in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education.   TransOptions covers all the costs, along with local and regional sponsors, to ensure that all students regardless of economic circumstances have a chance to compete.
