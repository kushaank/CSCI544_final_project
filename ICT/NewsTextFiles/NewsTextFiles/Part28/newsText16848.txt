
State legislation passed in 2011 that sets requirements for teacher evaluations in Minnesota school districts takes effect at the start of the 2014-15 school year.

The Spring Lake Park School District made modifications to its evaluation system in order to comply with the law, rather than follow the Minnesota Department of Education’s evaluation model, which administrators and teachers called “ugly” in a presentation to the school board in early April.

District administrators and teachers have to agree on a plan, otherwise the state’s plan is automatically implemented.
