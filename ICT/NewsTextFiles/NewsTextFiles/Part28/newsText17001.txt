
The Obama administration’s Department of Labor, which is supposed to represent the needs of U.S. workers, said Monday that the government needs to find ways to get more skilled foreign workers into the country.

“Too many foreign students – many from Asian countries – come to the United States to further their education but must return home when they cannot obtain a green card or immigrant visa. As part of President Obama’s immigration reforms, he has called for “stapling green cards” to the diplomas of foreign graduates students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields,” Lu wrote.

The statement appears to be a direct contradiction to the Labor Department’s main mission, which is to help American workers.

Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) is among the more vocal critics of the Obama administration’s push to create legal status for millions of illegal immigrants. Earlier this month, he blasted an Obama administration proposal to create more than 100,000 job opportunities for the spouses of certain visa holders, at a time when millions of Americans are still out of work.

Sessions hosted a call with scholars last week who said the Obama administration is putting forward the false idea that the U.S. doesn’t have enough skilled workers, and that more are needed from overseas. One economist said there is little evidence to support that given that wages for these high skilled jobs aren’t rising.
