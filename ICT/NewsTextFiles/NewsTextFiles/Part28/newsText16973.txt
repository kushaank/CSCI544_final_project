HISD's Sinclair Elementary is about to get a serious upgrade.

The school was originally built without a library. Their current one was literally pieced together using donated items from other schools.

When the Astros and Bank of Texas heard of the idea to renovate the library, they decided to donate $5,000 to the school's fundraising campaign.

The renovation will include all new shelving that makes additional space for more computers and new technology.

"I think access for students to the books is the key point of the new design," school principal Abigail Taylor said. "We'll be able to have lower shelving for some picture books for our pre-k and kinder students, so they will be able to walk up and see the titles."

"We're going to have a specific set up for e-readers set up for the students to access books digitally," librarian Donna Williams said. "And we'll have nooks, iPads or kindles."

The principal says once the renovation is complete, honing an important skill will be even easier.

"Being a strong reader makes you better in every subject and the first thing you need to sharpen your skills as a reader is access to books," said Taylor.

The school at PTA is still raising funds to complete the $32,000 renovation. Work is set to begin after year is over. The renovated library will open in time for the next school year.
