
THE Aquino administration on Monday appealed to the members of the Alliance of Concerned Teachers not to go on mass leave and disrupt the opening of classes on June 2 if the entry-level salary of public school teachers are not increased.

He made his appeal even as Education Secretary Armin Luistro said his department will not stand in the way of any proposed measure to increase the salaries of state teachers.

“The Department of Education will not object to any measure that will help public school teachers. As long as there is adequate funding, a raise in teachers’ salaries will be welcome. We also recognize the right of our teachers to raise their concerns publicly,” Luistro said.

He made his statement even as ACT Teachers party-list Rep. Antonio Tinio renewed his appeal to Aquino to heed his group’s long-standing demand for salary increases.

“Two years have passed since the government raised the salaries of its employees but the ordinary Filipino is battered daily by the increases in the cost of living,” Tinio said.

Tinio authored House Bill 245 that calls for at least P25,000 and P15,000 monthly salaries for public school teachers and non-teaching personnel, respectively.

Kabataan party-list Rep. Terry Ridon threatened to file administrative charges against officials of the Commission on Higher Education before the Ombudsman for allegedly failing to act on the students appeal against the higher tuition being charged by the private schools.

ACT members trooped to the Palace on Monday to deplore Malacañang’s refusal to approve a wage increase for the country’s public school teachers.

The group demanded an increase in their entry-level wages to P25,000 from P18,549 and an increase in the minimum wages of government workers to P15,000.
