
US telecoms giant AT&T plans to buy satellite TV firm DirecTV for £29billion in the latest sign that the worlds of pay-TV and telecoms are blending into one.

AT&T, which is struggling for growth in the mature US mobile phone market, wants to get its hands on DirecTV’s satellite television customers.

The proposed takeover is the latest in a string of multi-billion pound deals marrying players in the communications and media industries in the past year.

US cable firm Liberty Global bought internet, phones and TV group Virgin Media in a transaction worth £13.8billion last year.

Vodafone has snapped up major cable operators in Germany and Spain, sealing deals for Kabel Deutschland and Ono.

The landscape has been shifting as consumers increasingly use a variety of devices to access television, film and games, creating insecurity that encourages firms to branch out into offering more services.

But US analysts have questioned why AT&T is seeking growth by buying DirecTV, given that US satellite TV subscriptions have stalled amid fierce competition from online services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, formerly known as LoveFilm.

AT&T said it expected to be able to add 15million broadband customers, mostly in rural areas, within four years of the deal closing, adding to its base of 11million internet subscribers at present.

The takeover could also prove the latest in a long line of victories for Berkshire Hathaway, the vehicle of investment guru Warren Buffett, which is the top shareholder in DirecTV.
