
During a  visit to Troy Buchanan High School, Gov. Jay Nixon Monday announced he has authorized the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) to proceed with proposals of five tornado safe rooms at schools in five Missouri counties including Troy.

The Governor’s announcement came during a student assembly at the school. The Lincoln County R-III School District has proposed building a 12,600 square foot safe room that would shelter about 1,800 people, enough capacity for all students, faculty and staff on the high school campus. According to the district’s plans, the safe room space would also be utilized as  performing arts center and community meeting room. It could also be used as a community shelter in non-school hours.

Community safe rooms are specially designed and engineered structures  built to withstand 250 mile per hour winds, often utilizing 14-inch precast concrete and steel-reinforced doors. Walls and roof sections re capable of withstanding impacts from windborne  debris that can act as missiles.
