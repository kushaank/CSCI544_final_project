
[A]ngry students protested on Facebook and blogs. They gained enough momentum to be mentioned on Fox News Channel and several national news outlets.

The university didn’t think anything of the petting zoo at first, Winterer said. The school brought in a reindeer in December at the end of first semester and the event was well-received, Winterer said.

Some students said it would have been a poor use of the university’s money. Others felt the event was a form of animal cruelty and disrespectful to the animal. Others felt it was racially or religiously motivated.

The Residence Hall Association, a student organization at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minn., arranged to bring a camel to campus from a vendor located north of St. Paul on May 14 for an end-of-semester, petting-zoo-type event for students.

It was never the university’s intent to make a political or cultural statement of any kind by bringing a camel to campus. In light of the negative comments, it was clear that the camel’s visit would no longer be simply a fun, stress-reducing activity for students as originally intended. At that point, the university decided to cancel the event.

The good news is that St. Paul’s Como Zoo remains open, at the other end of town and therefore a safe distance from the campus of the University of St. Thomas. I’m not sure whether its camel is still on hand, but the giraffe and gorilla remain on display without too much controversy.
