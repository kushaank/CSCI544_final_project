
THEY ran because other people’s lives depended on it.

Around 155 pupils at Oasis Academy Mayfield took part in their very own Race for Life , ahead of the Cancer Research UK event in Southampton this summer.

Students ran, walked and jogged around the 3km course to raise money for the same charity and are on course to raise more than £2,000.

Michele Mcilveen, from the school, said: “It was a fantastic turnout on a lovely afternoon and we were pleased to see staff and students get involved and families come down to support us.

The race took place in the school grounds off Ashley Crescent.
