
TOURISM chiefs are to show off the very best of Nottingham at an international event in Germany.

A team will demonstrate   the city's offerings at the worldwide IMEX exhibition for incentive travel, meetings and events, taking in place  in Frankfurt from tomorrow to Thursday.

Visitors will be offered the chance to "meet Robin Hood" and  sample the award-winning Bramley Apple Martini cocktail, which was chosen by VisitEngland earlier this year as part of English Tourism Week to help tell the story of Nottinghamshire.

Nottingham is already known the world over as the home of Robin Hood. Now, the city is using its legendary son to help raise the profile of the city and its benefits as a destination for business events, conferences, exhibitions and meetings.

David Randall, director of conferencing and events with the Nottingham Event Team said: "We are looking forward to showcasing Nottingham's credentials as a Green City and a Science City at this major exhibition.  With Nottingham BioCity, one of Europe's largest bioscience incubators, and the brand new MediCity, to two of the greenest universities in the UK, we have the right knowledge and know-how to bring specialist events to life.

"Nottingham has so much to offer as a destination for corporate events and conferences – high-quality venues, a compact city centre, excellent transport links and expertise in a broad range of sectors. Our city is well connected, creative and friendly, with a broad range of venues to suit any event needs, from 10 to 10,000 delegates.

"As well as being the destination of choice for conferencing and events, Nottinghamshire's leisure and sporting events are world-renowned – from live music, theatre performances, festivals, outdoor and sporting events, all just a stone's throw away."
