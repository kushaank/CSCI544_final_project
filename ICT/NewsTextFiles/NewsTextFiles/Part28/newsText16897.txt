
SOHAR â€” The Sohar University Language Center (SULC) Arabic Course celebrated the Awarding of Certificates to the Chinese students graduated from this unique programme. These SULC students received the highest commendations from Prof Stephen Hill, the Acting Vice-Chancellor, Dr Hamdan al Fazari, and the Pro Vice-Chancellor of Resources and from their academic instructors. A total of 16 students from China and Taiwan completed the programme. This was a one year Arabic Course held at SULC. Sohar University is very proud of all of these students, and commends them for their hard work. This was an extraordinary experience for them to master Arabic in a total immersion environment. The certificates were awarded by Dr Hamdan al Fazari to all the SULC students and the top students in their group were given special recognition. In addition to that, Sohar University is eagerly awaiting a new batch of Chinese students to join the next Arabic course being offered at SULC.
