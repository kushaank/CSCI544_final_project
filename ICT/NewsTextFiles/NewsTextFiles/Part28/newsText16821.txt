
Research done by Emory found there are only slightly more 1,000 psychiatrists in Georgia. The report says the problem is the worst in rural areas and nearly half of Georgia’s 159 counties do not have a single psychiatrist. Dr. Ben Druss directs the Center for Behavioral Health Policy at Emory’s Rollins School of Public Health.

Druss says one way to boost the number of psychiatrists and the size of Georgia’s mental health workforce is to increase training in community psychiatry.

The University System of Georgia said the state has recently graduated more licensed medical professionals who could assist with the state’s mental health needs, but other solutions are needed to close the gap.
