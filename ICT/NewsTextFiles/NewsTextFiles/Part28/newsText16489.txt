
Bayern Munich defender Holger Badstuber is looking forward to a "new beginning" after enduring an injury-plagued season.

The Germany international has not played for Bayern since suffering a cruciate ligament tear in his right knee against Borussia Dortmund in December 2012.

A recurrence of the same injury 12 months ago forced Badstuber into another stint on the sidelines but a return to training earlier in May offered hope that the 25-year-old could be fit for the start of next season.

"I'll train through now just up to the start of training in July," he told Kicker. "It is an insane joy to be back on the field.

"This time has made me a different person. I am now faced with a new beginning."

Badstuber accepts that there may be doubts over whether he can return to his best form following the lengthy lay-off but insists that he is only preoccupied with recovering full fitness.

"It's logical there were doubts around the club," he added. "We're a massive club but I don't think about what might be planned, only about myself.
