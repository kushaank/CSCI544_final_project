
production, we do not foresee a return to growth until 2018 at the earliest.

Illustrative of challenges faced by the wider metals sector, steel mills will remain under significant pressure, as low output prices squeeze margins. This will encourage consolidation of operations and dampen output growth. We forecast that steel production will post only erratic growth in the coming years, as low prices will continue to bite. We forecast steel output of 42.8mn tonnes (mnt) in 2017, just 0.7% above 2012 output and 11.8% below the 2007 peak.

Three firms dominate steel production in Germany. ThyssenKrupp is Germany´s largest steel maker and will be implementing significant job cuts in 2014. ArcelorMittal has a further 8.0mntpa (mn tonnes per annum) capacity at sites in Bremen, Duisburg, EisenhÃ¼ttenstadt and Hamburg. Due to its proximity to Poland, the EisenhÃ¼ttenstadt steelworks exports nearly half its output to Central and Eastern Europe. The other three ArcelorMittal facilities are reliant on Western European markets for their exports. Salzgitter AG is the third largest steelmaker with plants in Salzgitter and Peine in the middle of the country. Germany also hosts Europe´s largest copper refiner, Aurubis AG.
