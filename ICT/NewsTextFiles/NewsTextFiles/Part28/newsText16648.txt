SANTO DOMINGO. The Water and Sewer Corporation of Santo Domingo (CAASD) announced that starting at 6:00 a.m. this Saturday, 17 May, they will change 60 linear meters of the sewer pipes on the Gustavo Mejia Ricart Avenue, to resolve a "serious" backup of these waters that is affecting the area.

Alejandro Montas, the CAASD director, said that due to the size of the stretch involved, traffic will be diverted for three day on the stretch between Virgilio Dias Ordo√±ez and the Maximo Aviles Blonda streets on the avenue, in the Ensanche Julieta Morales.

Montas said that in order to ease traffic, the CAASD is counting on the support of the Metropolitan Transit Authority (AMET).

He said that the CAASD technicians will substitute 15 inch concrete sewer pipes for 16 inch PVC pipes in order to improve the sewer service.
