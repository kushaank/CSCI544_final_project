
ALGIERS, May 16 (Reuters) - Algeria sent a team of special forces to evacuate its ambassador and embassy staff from Libya in a military plane after a militant threat to its embassy, officials and a security source said on Friday.

Algeria gave few details on the threat, but security in Libya has deteriorated and at least eight foreign diplomats have been abducted in Libya this year by militants seeking to exchange hostages for fighters detained overseas.

"Due to a real and imminent threat targeting our diplomats the decision was taken in coordination with Libyan authorities to urgently close our embassy and consulate general temporarily in Tripoli," the foreign ministry in Algiers said in a statement.

The security source said the midnight operation on Thursday involved a team of Algerian special forces who arrived in Tripoli to escort the diplomats out of Libya. The threat was from al Qaeda, the source said, adding that the ambassador and staff had all now been evacuated.
