Students from schools in the Mid-Western Region will have a better chance of getting into university under a new agreement between the NSW Government and the Universities Admissions Centre.

Minister for Education Adrian Piccoli said the socio-economic measure will be the Family Occupation and Education Index, which was developed by the Department of Education and Communities and is used to distribute needs-based funding to public schools.

“Forty-two schools are new to the list and the total number of schools eligible will expand to about 270, including 155 in regional and remote areas,” Mr Piccoli said.
