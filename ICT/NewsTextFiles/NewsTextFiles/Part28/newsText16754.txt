
TRIBUTES have been paid to Durham University engineering student Luke Pearce after a body found in the River Wear was confirmed to be his.

The rugby-loving 19-year-old, from Hounslow, West London, went missing in the early hours of Sunday, May 11 after drinking with friends in Durham city centre.

After a week of searches of the river and riverbank, including by students who helped look for him, his body was discovered yesterday morning (Sunday, May 18) near Baths Bridge by rowers.

Mr Pearce, who was described by a friend as a “gentle giant”, was a popular member of the 1,200-student St Cuthbert’s Society, one of the university’s colleges.

University Pro Vice-Chancellor, Prof Graham Towl, said he was saddened by Mr Pearce’s death and concerned that he was the second student to die in the river recently.

He added that the university would consider what lessons could be learned from the tragedy.

Prof Elizabeth Archibald, Principal of St Cuthbert’s Society, said:”We are all devastated, very shocked, very saddened and we feel very deeply for Luke’s family and many friends.

“He was a very popular young man. It was only his first year but he had made many friends and was well known and very well liked across the society and across his department.

Prof Archibald said the university and students would consider holding a memorial event or events for Mr Pearce.

A Durham Police spokesman said: “A post mortem was conducted yesterday (Sunday), the results of which will now be forwarded the coroner.

The County Durham Coroner is due to hold the opening inquest on Wednesday (May 21).

A full hearing will be held once investigations into Mr Pearce’s death have been completed.
