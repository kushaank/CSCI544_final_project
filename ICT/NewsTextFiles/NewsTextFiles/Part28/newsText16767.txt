
CEBU, Philippines - Mandaue City Mayor Jonas Cortes has encouraged various stakeholders to continue supporting the initiatives of the Department of Education in a speech at yesterday's launching of Brigada Eskwela in the city.

"Education is a legacy and fortune that we can give them (children) which no one else can take away from them," Cortes said before a crowd composed of city officials and police, as well as representatives from the private sector.

Cortes said he is hoping that more from the private sector will continue to support the initiatives of DepEd through public-private partnership as he believes that the school is the venue where future leaders of the nation are being molded.

The city's Brigada Eskwela this year was launched at the Subangdaku Elementary School because the school has been a two-time national awardee for being the best program implementer in the country.

Brigada Eskwela is a simultaneous clean-up and beautification program in all public elementary and high schools in the whole country. This year's theme is "Ensuring Disaster-Preparedness and Safety in Schools."

All 27 public elementary schools and 22 public secondary schools in Mandaue City are set to conduct a simultaneous week-long clean-up and beautification drive starting yesterday.

Schools Division Superintendent Virginia Zapanta thanked the parents, teachers, government and the private sector for their support which helped make Subangdaku Elementary School a consistent national awardee.

Rosalina Gonzales, school principal, said she just encouraged the parents to do their part in the school programs.

Â "We are not aiming for a grand slam victory but what is important is that there is full cooperation of the parents and (it will be) better if the private sector continue to support us," the principal said.
