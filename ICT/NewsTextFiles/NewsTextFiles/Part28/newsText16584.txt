
HANOVER (AP) — Volunteers at  an exotic animal rescue in southern Pennsylvania are still looking for a  monkey that got loose and ran away during a fire that destroyed the  facility.

The East Coast Exotic Animal Rescue in Adams County  burned down early Saturday. Two residents escaped, and most of the  animals were saved from the fire. Two cats died.

Fairfield Fire Chief Adam Jacobs said the fire was likely caused by a wireless router that shorted out and ignited some papers.

BLAIRSVILLE 10, APOLLO  0: Three Blairsville pitchers combined to throw a two-hitter, and the  Colts amassed 12 hits, including five extra-base hits, to blank host  Apollo in a game that was shortened to six innings due to the mercy  rule.

The Colts scored six runs in the top of the second inning and extended the lead to 8-0 after three innings.
