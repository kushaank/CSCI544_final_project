As part of Callahan�s Karate�s Powerful Words Character Development program, May 2014 is Integrity Month. As part of the program, all students at Callahan�s will be studying, developing and experiencing powerful life lessons focusing on understanding the value and benefit of being a person who is true to yourself, your values, and your word.

"Having integrity is a foundational part of having strong character. In fact, character and integrity are inextricably linked. Character reflects a person�s values and integrity is the grit to uphold them. They must work together to have meaning. After all, what good is gratitude when we are not really grateful? What good is concern when the concern is falsified? We want our children to build genuine character -- and that takes integrity," said Dr. Robyn Silverman, Callahan�s Karate child and adolescent expert, and creator of the Powerful Words Character Development system used at the facility.

Richard Callahan, Senior Instructor of Callahan�s Karate explained: "Here at our studio, we feel that integrity is a major key to success. It�s important to us that our students say what they mean and mean what they say as they become the future leaders of our community. It�s a pleasure seeing our community recognized as a place with Powerful Character, and seeing our students lead the way! As this community�s premier Powerful Personal Development Center, we take this responsibility very seriously. We�re thrilled to help our students and our community to thrive and succeed, and Integrity month is going to help us to do just that."

According to Callahan�s Karate, their strong curriculum and the Powerful Words Character Development system provides students with the opportunities to become unstoppable in life.

"These lessons will remain with our students for life and we're honored to help them achieve the success that they deserve" said Callahan.

Callahan�s Karate owners Richard and Winnie Callahan have helped thousands of kids, teens, and adults to embrace a positive and healthy lifestyle.
