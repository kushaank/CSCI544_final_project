
DENMARK. The first Max Mara boutique at a European airport has opened at Copenhagen Kastrup. The 65sq m store includes a striking 6m high facade. The move is part of a wider expansion of the brand into the airport channel, where Max Mara has ambitions to open 50 stores over the next five to six years.

The new concept, designed by Duccio Grassi Architects, will feature a summary of the best the brand has to offer, said the airport company.

The design includes soft shades and organic materials such as wood teamed with stone and metal. Technology is used to create a sensory experience: in the window display traditional mannequins are replaced by a permanent video installation for example.

Max Mara is expanding into the airport arena and plans to open six stores in the channel during 2014, and 50 over the next five to six years. These will be concentrated mainly in Europe, Asia and the USA. Already confirmed for opening are stores in Madrid (with two Weekend Max Mara outlets), Malaga and Munich.
