
Specialising in classic American desserts, the Four Fat Ladies is the result of a collaboration between three sisters, Sherine, Nira and Heba Shunbo, for whom baking has been a life-long passion.

When the women launched the business, they had a fourth partner, hence the name, but now they say they think of their fourth “lady” as their mother.

All three women come from different backgrounds and careers; Nira worked in public relations, Heba in interior design, and Sherine in architecture.

Starting a business with family was difficult at first, they said.

“Everyone has different opinions and clashes happen, but eventually, once you learn how to communicate with each other, it all falls into place, like a jigsaw puzzle,”they said.

Their food focuses on American classics.

Their famous cheesecake is how is all started, which was originally their mother’s recipe.

Other things on their menu include classics like apple, peach and pecan pie, red velvet brownies, cookies and quiche.

The Four Fat Ladies are aiming at opening a store in Zamalek by the end of the year, but for now, they bake on a per-order basis. Most orders require 24 hours in advance notice so it is delivered fresh, but for more extravagant occasions, such as birthdays and weddings, the ladies like more notice so they have more leeway to deliver high-quality products.

The Four Fat Ladies says what makes them stand out against the competition is their focus on one concept.
