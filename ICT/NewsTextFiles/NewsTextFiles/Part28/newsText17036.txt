
Apparently former New York Times editor Jill Abramson, who has more than three decades of “real world” experience behind her before being ousted by the paper, has more in common with graduating seniors than you might expect.

Abramson’s commencement speech , comes at the heels of a heated media debate over whether pay disparity and gender played a role in her dismissal. According to the New Yorker, Abramson’s starting salary in 2011 was $475,000, compared to her male predecessor’s salary of $559,000.

New York Times Chairman Arthur Sulzberger Jr. has denied that gender and pay were involved in the company’s decision. Sulzberger told Bloomberg the decision was based on her poor management skills.

“You know the sting of losing. When that happens, show what you are made of,” she told the audience.

While she said, “losing a job you love hurts,” she did not seem bitter towards the company that let her go.

Abramson said she was asked by a Wake Forest student Sunday whether she plans to remove the New York Times “T” tattooed on her back.
