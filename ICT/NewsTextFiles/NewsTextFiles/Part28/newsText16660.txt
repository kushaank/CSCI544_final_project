
Algerian runner and the reigning 1500m Olympic champion Taoufik Makhloufi started celebrating before he crossed the finish line for the 800m race, giving Kenya’s Robert Kiptoo Biwott the opportunity to take the win.

Makhloufi sticks his tongue out and appears to be looking at the race clock, not noticing Biwott to his right.

The race took place over the weekend at a Diamond League competition in Shanghai, China.

Biwott ran a personal best, and along with the win, he took home the $10,000 grand prize.

Here’s hoping a lesson has been learned.
