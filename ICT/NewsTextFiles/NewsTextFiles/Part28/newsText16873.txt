
Charter schools vary in academic achievement compared to traditional districts.

�Sue Carey -Because I was not happy with Pontiac school system. The charter schools challenge your child beyond their potential. My son is in 8th grade but reading, doing math at 10th- grade level.

*Ray Solving - If we want to truly empower parents, then we would operate under a voucher system. Parents should get to choose any institution, government run or private, to which to send their children and their money.

*Travis LaFalce - I went to a charter school from kindergarten to 8th grade, and if I had a child, he or she would never set foot anywhere near a charter school.

*Sherry Lazdinsh - We have one charter school in our area and the waiting list is long, There is a lottery system involved and lots of parents are left upset. Obviously charter schools must offer something that the public schools are lacking or they wouldn�t be in such demand.

�Tammy Violette Svenkesen  - I love that my kids attend a charter school. Not only are they pushing my children academically (both test above grade level and were bored in the local school), but I also appreciate the moral standards that are considered a must for every student.

�Vera Christina I worked for a charter school for several years. I watched standards lower and class sizes rise. It�s not what I want for my own children.

Parents across Michigan have pulled 140,000 children from public districts and enrolled them in smaller independent charter schools hoping for better performance.

But it�s difficult to know whether those wishes are coming true.

�Charter schools absent (local) school board oversight have far less accountability for student achievement than traditional public schools.� ,� said Thomas J. Gentzel, NSBA executive director. .... �data indicate that just one in five charter schools outperform public schools in reading and math assessments, according to Stanford University�s Center for Research on Educational Outcomes (CREDO).

Rarely are the Michigan Education Achievement Program (MEAP) scores of charter schools made as public as those of their big sister public school districts.

As the U.S. Senate and National School Boards Association debates the proposed expansion of charter schools this month, reports indicate that charter school academies funded by taxpayer dollars are not necessarily better than public schools.

A survey by Stanford University comparing Oakland County reading scores for charter schools in Michigan is posted on the Michigan Department of Education website.

�Stanford University�s CREDO research center found that 80 percent of Michigan charter schools perform below the state average in reading, and 84 percent perform below average in math,� according to a report from the Education Trust-Midwest report, a nonpartisan research group based in Royal Oak.

For the MEAP fourth grade reading results for the 2013-14 school year, the state average of all Michigan schools indicated 70 percent were proficient and Oakland County, 75.7 percent were proficient.

In Oakland County districts where some  charters operate, the Waterford average was 68.9 percent proficient, Southfield  64.2 percent; Holly 74.7 percent; and Pontiac 30.5 percent.

� Holly Academy 95 proficient;

� Michigan School for the Arts, Pontiac, 40.0;

� Pontiac Academy for Excellence 26.8;

� Sara J. Webber Media Arts Academy, Pontiac, 31.3;

� Oakside Scholars Charter Academy Pontiac, 45.6;

� Taylor International Academy, Southfield 48.8;

�Academy of Southfield, 45.6;

� AGBU Manoogian, Southfield, 67.9;

� Academy of Southfield, 45.6;

� Michigan Mathematics and Science Academy, (moved from Hazel Park to Centerline) 76.9;

� Joseph Pollack Academic Center of Excellence, Southfield, 53.4.

The Education Trust-Midwest advocates for accountability of charter schools and making the universities that operate them to be held responsible for them.

While academic scores are important to parents,  sometimes there are other reasons they send their children to charter schools  including  safe environment, smaller class sizes and special magnet programs, such as arts and science.

For example, Peggy MacMaster has praises for Pontiac Academy of Excellence, which was founded by Oakland Livingston Human Service Agency more than a dozen years ago and now runs from preschool through high school.

�They are  absolutely fabulous,� MacMaster said about the kids, teachers and counselors.

�While you hear about bullying and shootings other places, they really come together at Pontiac Academy for Excellence. The staff is over the top the way they work with students,� she said in a phone call to urge that the school be recognized.

The Education Trust-Midwest advocates for schools that will close the gap in achievement and make education for all students equal.

�What we found is that while some charters ranked high in terms of their performance for low income students, others ranked low,�  according to the Trust report.

The Education Trust-Midwest study referred to in the report compared proficiency averages of a group of charter and Detroit district K-8 schools that met specific criteria. All schools selected for comparison had at least 72 percent of students eligible for free and reduced-cost lunch, explained analyst Sunil Joy.

The charter and Detroit school averages in the study were compared to each other and also compared to overall state averages, state low-income school averages and overall Detroit public school averages.

�Of  40 Detroit public K-8 schools in study - 26  tested below Detroit district average,  and 14 above.

�Of  38 Detroit charter K-8 schools - 15  tested below Detroit district average, and 23 above.
