
ST. MARY’S CITY, Md.—Talented young artists from St. Mary’s County schools have a new, local outlet to exhibit their creative works. The “Young at Art” exhibition, established by the St. Mary’s College of Maryland Boyden Gallery and Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program, represents an expansion in the partnership between arts programs at the college and St. Mary’s County schools. Its purpose is to offer students valuable real-world experience, feedback and recognition from established arts professionals.

“It is not just an exhibition, but an educational opportunity to learn about the other side of the creative process, which is sharing the work created,” said Cristin Cash, director of the Boyden Gallery. “Without such an outlet it is like being a musician and never being able to perform.” Cash also spoke about the county’s shortlist of opportunities for public showcases of youth art, noting that the only other occasion is the county’s annual Youth Art Month.

A pilot of the exhibition—on display now through May 30—is already proving successful. It opened to a well-attended reception held Monday, May 12, in the gallery. Artist and art educator Moriah Morgan of Leonardtown, Md., juried works by artists from Spring Ridge Middle School, Great Mills and St. Mary’s Ryken High Schools. Selected pieces were divided into categories sixth through eighth, ninth through 10th, and 11th through 12th grades and judged on composition, contrast, technique and creativity.

Spring Ridge Middle School Art Teacher Lori Huff explained to her students that the exhibition is “a beginning step to being a serious artist.” “It is important to know about setting up, photographing and displaying their artwork,” she said.

The exhibition, says Cash, is also an outlet for students to share their work with the people they care about and the community. “The best part was watching the students come in the door and see their work and show their friends and family,” she said.
