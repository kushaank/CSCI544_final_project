
A German tourist has been injured in a car jacking incident in Co Wicklow.

She was one of two people in a German registered Mercedes, which stopped to assist at the scene of a road accident at Clara Vale in Rathdrum at around half past 2 this afternoon.

Gardaí said a bus and a black Volvo had collided, and when the German tourists stopped to lend assistance, their car was taken by the four men who had been travelling in the Volvo.

It is believed the Volvo had been stolen and was used in an earlier burglary in Athy, Co Kildare.

Gardaí have since located the German tourists' car in Tullow in Co. Carlow. It has been preserved for a technical examination.

The German woman has been taken to hospital to be treated for what are described as "minor injuries".
