SHIPBOARD SAFETY: Tacoma Preservation Society volunteers Lyn Head, Braden Stockham, Fred Houweling and TAFE SA lecturer Travis Henson with one of the lifeboats on the Tacoma.

CLASS was in on the Tacoma last week as volunteers learnt the ropes of shipboard safety.

TAFE SA ran the elements of shipboard safety course to give the Tacoma's core group of volunteers skills to respond to emergencies on the boat.

A lot of the training was done on the vessel, from survival at sea to using equipment such as fire extinguishers.

Aquaculture and maritime lecturer Travis Henson said running the training on board the Tacoma, using the boat's own safety and emergency equipment, helped the volunteers relate the teaching back to their specific vessel.

Other practicals were held off vessel including a life raft and in-water survival session at the pool and a fire practical at a rural property, where the volunteers had the opportunity to practice extinguishing different types of fires.

Mr Henson said shipboard safety training was not compulsory for vessel crews but it was beneficial, particular for crew on a boat like the Tacoma, which often had paying passengers who would not necessarily have any experience on boats.
