The global launch and unveiling of World Free Zones Organisation, which aims to transform the way in which many economies around the world operate, has taken place in Dubai.

World Free Zones Organisation (World FZO) is a new non-profit entity operating as an association for all free zones around the world.

Established in Geneva, Switzerland and headquartered in the Dubai Airport Freezone, World FZO said it will enhance public and general knowledge and the perception of free zones, and will help to increase awareness of the advantages of free zones in terms of economic and social development, foreign and direct investment.

UAE-based Dr Mohammed Alzarooni will be the chairperson of World FZO, which will also include officials from the Dominican Republic, India and Ireland.

Alzarooni said: “The World Free Zones Organization, which we are excited to be launching today, will promote a spirit of collaboration, dialogue and guidance.

He added: “The creation of such an organization would not be possible without the inspired leadership and vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum. It is his vision that led us to establish the first ever multilateral organisation grown out of Dubai.

According to a recent report from the World Bank, the UAE is the leading Arab country when it comes to ease of doing business. The UAE tops the region in the categories of starting a business, registering property, and trading across borders.
