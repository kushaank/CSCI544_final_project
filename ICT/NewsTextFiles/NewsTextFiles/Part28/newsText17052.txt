
MYSORE:  OBC students of  Maharaja's College were seen running from pillar to post for  examination hall ticket on Monday.

Reason: the college authorities have withheld the tickets of some students, claiming that they had not paid the college fee for 2013-14. But the students want the college to give them a discount in fee.

Quoting rules, the students said that they need to pay only Rs 2,500 per year, and this includes tuition fee and examination fee, while the government would pay the rest. But now, the college is asking for an additional fee of Rs 2,286.

H MBasavaraju, a second year BA student, said: "The college has been asking us to pay Rs 2,286 so that we are given hall tickets. We had paid Rs 2,500 during admission. The college authorities had not informed us about the additional fee then," he said.

The students said that they did get a discount in fee last year without even applying for the same. "But now, they are demanding Rs 2,286 a few days before the start of exams," they said. The exams will begin on Wednesday.

Another student B R Santosh Kumar said: "Following several protests, the college authorities had assured us fee discount. But now, the principal is not issuing hall tickets," he said.

Seeking discount, the students had provided caste certificates and other documents at the time of admission.

Denying the allegations,  Maharaja College principal S N Gayathri said that they had put up notifications on the notice board, asking students to apply for scholarship or fee discount. "But they have failed to do so. Now, the university has directed (UoM-affiliated) colleges not to issue hall ticket unless the fee is paid. If UoM asks us to issue hall tickets, I will allow them to write exams," the principal said.

If their demand is not met, the students said that will stage a protest against the college and UoM authorities in front of the DC's office on Tuesday.
