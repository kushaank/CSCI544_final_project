
MADISON (WKOW) -- The Dane County Medical Examiner's Office has identified the woman killed in an officer-involved shooting in Madison.

She is Ashley DiPiazza, 26, of Madison.

Autopsy results confirm DiPiazza died from firearm-related injuries.

DiPiazza was involved in a domestic disturbance at an apartment in the 1100 block of MacArthur Rd. around 1:20 a.m. Sunday. Police say the woman's boyfriend called 911, telling the operator that he left the apartment after his girlfriend armed herself with a handgun and was threatening him. Police officers responded and they shot and killed DiPiazza after they say she threatened them.

The officers involved were placed on administrative leave, which is department policy. The Wisconsin Department of Justice Division of Criminal Investigation is leading the investigation into the officer-involved shooting.
