
You saw the contest and you listened to the song. Now comes the chance for consumers to eat controversial crooner Conchita Wurst for themselves.

Last week's Eurovision Song Contest winner has been given the ultimate honour by a German ice cream maker, with a sausage flavoured treat created in her name.

It is not the first time that the gourmet ice cream makers in the southern city of Munich, in Bavaria, Germany, have opted for a more unusual brand of ice cream.

A spokesman for the company, Benjamin Koertig, said: "In Munich we have the Weiss Wurst - white sausage - and we also have a white sausage ice cream, so it's not really surprising that we now have the Conchita sausage."

In the past other bizarre variations of ice cream offered by the company include a lemon paprika, a beer flavour, Gorgonzola cheese flavour, and a mozzarella and basil ice cream mix.

The new Conchita sausage ice cream includes a Viennese sausage sticking out of the top to make sure that the message gets home that it's not for the faint hearted. It is described as being "spicy but creamy, flavourful and rounded." And it is already proving to be a hit.

Koertig added: "Heston Blumenthal created egg and bacon ice cream in the UK so it should not be too shocking to open-minded foodies that there is now a sausage-flavoured ice cream on the market. Austrians and Germans are really proud of her achievement and we are struggling to keep up with demand for the ice cream."
