
Under negotiations for a new trade deal between the United States and Europe, the release of a secret memo shows Americans are being pushed to increase oil and gas exploration through the process of fracking and other methods.

Obtained by the Huffington Post, the memo contains the energy   policies that EU negotiators are hoping to see implemented in a   finalized Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).   Among the EUâ€™s positioning is that â€œenergy goodsâ€� â€“ classified as "coal, crude oil, oil products, natural gas, whether   liquefied or not, and electrical energyâ€� â€“ are determined to   â€œautomaticallyâ€� comply with the processes needed to authorize   export.

"Exports of energy goods to the other Party shall be deemed   automatically to comply with any conditions and tests foreseen in   the Partiesâ€™ respective legislation for the granting of export   licenses," the document states.

With the majority of TTIP negotiations being held in secrecy, itâ€™s unclear to what extent the EUâ€™s preferences have been met.   The document was reportedly first sent to American officials in   September.

If implemented, however, the terms would mark a significant shift   in US energy policy. Crude oil exports have been banned by the US   since 1975. According to a recent Wall Street Journal report,   Energy Secretary, Ernest Moniz, wants to consider relaxing the   ban, and officials believe the White House can issue exemptions   to some energy companies in order to allow them to export crude   oil.

As RT noted previously, the idea doesnâ€™t currently   have Democratic support in Congress, but the statements could be   a signal that the US is considering methods to reduce European   dependency on Russian energy in the wake of the Ukraine conflict.

For environmentalists, the position staked out by the EU in the   memo has raised concern over the possibility that fracking â€“   already a controversial process â€“ will be expanded across the US   alongside offshore drilling and natural gas exploration. Not only   would boosting American energy exploration hurt the environment,   they say, it would also slow down efforts to move the world   towards renewable energy.

"Encouraging trade in dirty fossil fuels would mean more   dangerous fracking here in the U.S. and would push more   climate-disrupting fuels into the European Union," Ilana   Solomon, director of the Responsible Trade Program at Sierra   Club, told Huffington Post. "The oil and gas industry is the   only winner in this situation."

Over the last year, fracking in particular has come under fire in   numerous states and on the national level, where the process is   being blamed for record levels of earthquakes in multiple states.   After highly pressurized water, sand, and other chemicals are   blasted into layers of rock in order to free oil and gas, the   wastewater is pumped into underground wells â€“ many of which have   been built along fault lines and cause friction near them.

Notably, the EUâ€™s energy preferences would see fracking rise in   the US while the practice comes under harsher scrutiny in Europe.   Already, France and Bulgaria have barred fracking, while other EU   countries such as Germany are considering similar bans.

The revelation for the EUâ€™s energy preferences also comes as   opposition to the TTIP has grown over the last year. According to   Reuters, the potential trade deal could bring up to $100 billion   in economic activity and up to 1 million new jobs, but concerns   over the environment, even fewer tariffs, genetically modified   foods, and the general secrecy surrounding the negotiations has   brought criticism from both the left and the right.

"The TTIP is going to damage our personal freedoms, our food   safety laws and our welfare protection," Belgian trade   unionist Lazaros Goulios told Reuters. "These are secret   negotiations. Who knows what is happening?"

last i checked we are no longer a colony of Europe.  the best response would be to tell the EU to stick it.

however the bureaucrats will embrace this like they have every other agreement that has damaged the US.
