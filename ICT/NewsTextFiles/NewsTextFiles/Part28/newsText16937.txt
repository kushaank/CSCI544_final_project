
Networking vendor Netgear has announced two new solutions in its ProSAFE business-class wireless family, the WC7600 Premium Wireless Controller, and the WN370 Wall Mount Access Point. Both these offerings are designed for mid-sized hospitality facilities, K-12 schools, colleges, senior centers, assisted living centers, and other multi-tenant sites.

Cheng also singled out a specific segment of the education market for these solutions.

The new ProSAFE WC7600 Premium Wireless Controller supports centralized management for the complete range of Netgear ProSAFE Managed Access Points, including single band and dual band products, with 2×2 and 3×3 options, as well as the newly announced WN370 Wall Mount Access Point. It can support several thousand concurrent clients across 150 access points in a stacked arrangement. An upgrade over the WC7520 controller, it features 900 mb/s speed compared to the WC7520’s 600 mb/s.

The WC7600 will list for $USD 3079 with 2 basic access point licenses.

“We are offering a bundle of 1 controller and 10 high end access points for an $11,500 list price, which is a small discount which gives 10 controllers for the price of 9,” Cheng said.

Cheng said they are also significantly dropping the price of the WC7520.

“Controllers have been expensive but we are adjusting the price of this to go after the standalone access point market,” he said. “It has always been between $2000-$3000 for centralized management, but we are bringing down pricing to affordable, with a street price of around $1200.

The other new offering, the ProSAFE WN370 Wall Mount Access Point with Power over Ethernet (PoE) offers a compact form factor specifically designed to enable wired and wireless connectivity in mid-sized multi-tenant sites, reducing the cost of running multiple Ethernet cables to each room.

The ProSAFE WN370 Single Band 2.4GHz Wireless-N Wall Mount Access Point has a MSRP of $USD 219.

Cheng noted that two additional products, the WNDAP660 Premium Wireless-N Dual-Band Concurrent Access Point, and the WNDAP620 Premium Wireless-N Dual Band Access Point: are going through software enhancement. Previously standalone deployment products, they can now be done with centralized management. Their MSRPs are $USD 829 for the 660 and $USD 715 for the 620.

Finally, Cheng said that Netgear itself provides a free no strings attached consultation with the customer.
