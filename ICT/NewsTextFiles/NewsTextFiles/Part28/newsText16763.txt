PARMA, Ohio â€“ Test results have revealed that no one was exposed to measles at two Parma schools recently, according to the Cuyahoga County Board of Health.

The Board of Health said test results twice came back negative, meaning there is no cause for concern that anyone at Parma Senior High School or Thoreau Park Elementary School was exposed to the disease.

The possible exposure was reported as a precaution, the Board of Health said Monday, because someone exhibited symptoms similar to measles.

The Parma City Schools told parents earlier this month that the exposure might have happened between April 28 and May 2.

The district said earlier this month that it took precautions by sanitizing every school within the district and asking parents to keep any children who show symptoms of measles at home.

Measles, a highly contagious viral disease, has been an issue in Ohio recently . A measles outbreak in the Amish community in central Ohio, which has now infected 83 people, is the largest in the country since 1996. An outbreak of another viral disease, mumps, has infected more than 350 people around Ohio State University recently.
