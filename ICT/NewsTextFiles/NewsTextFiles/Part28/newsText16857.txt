ROCKFORD, MI -  Rockford High School senior Sydney Bogard was one of 21 students statewide to earn the Michigan Department of Education's (MDE) "Breaking Traditions" Award .

The award is given to students for surpassing obstacles and stereotypes to achieve success in career and technical education (CTE) programs.

“The Breaking Traditions Awards recognize high school and college students who have demonstrated success in CTE programs that are nontraditional to their gender,” said state Superintendent Mike Flanagan.

Bogard, 18, the only recipient from Kent and Ottawa counties, received the award with the other students at a ceremony May 14 at the Library of Michigan in Lansing.

Bogard, who has been interning at the Walker Police Department, said she wants to work for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) after graduating from Michigan State University.  She said she received a certificate and plaque at the ceremony.

To qualify for consideration, a student had to meet certain criteria, including exemplary completion of a program considered nontraditional for the student’s gender and being nominated by a school employee. Bogard was nominated by her CTE instructor, Tom Lamica.

Applicants also had to provide two letters of support and write a brief narrative explaining their career obstacles faced, plus key accomplishments.

MDE’s Office of Career and Technical Education oversees high school instructional programs that teach students skills in a specific career cluster. Most programs offer early college credit opportunities to provide a seamless transition to postsecondary education.
