
Back at Namaste we ordered some food and settled in to use the shitty Wi-Fi.  Later that evening Elmi and Emma braved the storm to join us for dinner.  The lightning was incredible. Walking though the storm without a flash-light would have been easy. Every footfall would have been accompanied by a brilliant flash, lighting the way ahead. They had originally wanted to eat at the Rasta Café but we vetoed it based on our experience earlier that day.
