
Judge David Ricciardone announced his verdict and sentence in a jury-waived trial at Worcester Superior Court.

Prosecutors say Nicolas Guaman, 37, was driving drunk without a license when he rolled through a stop sign and hit Matthew Denice’s motorcycle in 2011.  Denice was dragged nearly one-quarter of a mile.

Despite clearing Guaman of second degree murder, Ricciardone found him guilty on all of the other charges he faced, which included manslaughter, motor vehicle homicide OUI liquor, leaving the scene of an accident, driving without a license, reckless endangerment of a child and failing to stop for police.

Ricciardone sentenced Guaman to 12-to-14 years for the motor vehicle manslaughter charge and a concurrent sentence of 9-to-10 years on the motor vehicle homicide charge. Guaman has already served 2 1/2 years while awaiting trial.

The state asked for an 18-to-20 year sentence while the prosecution had asked the judge to impose a 5-to-7 year sentence.

Before sentencing, Denice’s stepfather Michael Maloney said if Guaman had only stopped, Matt would be alive today. Maloney told the court he’s seen no remorse from Guaman.

Matthew’s mother Maureen passed the judge a framed photograph of her son while tearfully addressing the courtroom.

“My world has been shattered and I still struggle to piece it together,” she said.

After Denice’s mother finished her statement, Judge Ricciardone told her in 10 years on the bench, he had never heard a more moving impact statement.

Guaman was living in the U.S. illegally and the death sparked a fierce debate in Massachusetts about immigration enforcement.

Guaman’s lawyer said his client was unaware Denice was pinned under the truck.
