Maybe they thought it was "No Pants Day."

A pair of South Carolina men were busted for disorderly conduct early Saturday morning after they refused to pull up their trousers during a disturbance at a local Waffle House, authorities said.

Andrew Gehring and Donovan Johnson, both 22, became hostile after a security guard at the restaurant "asked them to leave for failing to comply with his request to pull their pants up and not show their boxers," according to the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office report.

The pair continued to be belligerent and used foul language as police officers tried to arrange rides home for them, according to the sheriff's office.

"Mr. Johnson and Mr. Gehring both advised that they were out to have fun and implied they were Wofford students graduating this date and it wasn't their concern that proper decorum was needed in the public domain," according to the report.

Gehring was actually expelled from Wofford College in Spartanburg following a 2011 arrest for burglary and grand larceny, according to The Smoking Gun .
