
Charles Holloway was just 53 and headmaster of Westville House School on Carter’s Lane, Middleton, when he died unexpectedly on January 23, 2013. His death shocked the school community where he had worked since the summer of 1995.

Rosey James, who has worked at the school since the 1990s was appointed acting head teacher following Mr Holloway's death and later became head teacher.

Before she came to Ilkley Mrs James worked as a teacher in Namibia and Zimbabwe where she used the great outdoors and the desert to excite pupils and she used this experience to inspire her plans to create an outdoor classroom in memory of Mr Holloway.

The Holloway Hut as it is named was officially opened by Captain Shaun Brown, of the Army Foundation College in Harrogate. The ceremony was watched by the whole school, teachers and parents.

Mrs James welcomed guests and explained why outdoor education was so important.

“We live in a technological age and children are exposed more and more to a virtual world where they can learn at the press of a button but not touch real things, so outdoor education is vital to counterbalance that.

The school’s parents committee raised the funds for the classroom and chairman of governors Mr Neil Brown thanked everyone for pulling together to make it happen, on time and within budget.

“It is testament to the commitment of Westville and a reflection of the love and affection everyone felt for Mr Holloway,” he said.

Pupil Jemima Jagger thanked Cpt Brown and presented him with a school plaque.
