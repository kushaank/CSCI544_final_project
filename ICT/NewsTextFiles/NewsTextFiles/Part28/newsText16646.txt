
"That turns out to be incorrect. The glaciers of Greenland are likely to retreat faster and farther inland than anticipated - and for much longer - according to this very different topography we've discovered beneath the ice," lead author Mathieu Morlighem, a UCI associate project scientist said in the news release. "This has major implications, because the glacier melt will contribute much more to rising seas around the globe."

"Operation IceBridge vastly improved our knowledge of bed topography beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet," co-author Eric Rignot of UC Irvine and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said in the news release. "This new study takes a quantum leap at filling the remaining, critical data gaps on the map."
