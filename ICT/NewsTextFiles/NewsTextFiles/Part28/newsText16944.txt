The absence of a traffic signal on Williston Road and Southwest 21st Street is a problem to reader Valree Connell.

The street is in the Idylwild neighborhood, which includes Idylwild Elementary School. The school generates heavy traffic with school buses and parents, Connell said in an email.

Tony Falotico, assistant district of traffic operations for the Florida Department of Transportation, said studies of the intersection have determined a light is not warranted because traffic counts throughout the day do not meet the thresholds for a signal.

Roads with schools normally meet the requirements for an hour in the morning and sometimes for an hour in the afternoon, but not for the required eight hours during the day. Placing traffic signals in locations where they are not warranted most often cause additional delay and increased crashes, Falotico said.

Falotico said the removal of the school zone was discussed several years ago but the decision was made to keep the zone, placing the safety of the children above the inconvenience to motorists.

Falotico said the only viable solution is to develop alternative routes to and from the school to reduce traffic from Williston Road.
