
The party, which is making headlines nationally for its call for tight immigration controls and belief Britain should leave the European Union, has not set out a tailored manifesto for Redbridge.

Mr McGough said: "Our candidates all adopt the basic ethos of the party and we would like them to work together, but we expect them to take an independent approach and address what their residents want.

"We want a good representation at a local level to give us a better standing at the European election."

A total of 16 Ukip candidates will stand in half the borough's wards, with three each in Hainault, Fairlop and Bridge.

Explaining the strategy, Mr McGough said: "There is a lack of candidates and we tried to make sure we were fielding at least one candidate in each ward, but instead we're concentrating our efforts in other wards.

"I think we have a good chance of winning in Hainault because our candidates known the territory, and we have a high percentage of members in the area."

Bridge ward candidate Simon Hearn stood as a Conservative candidate in Chadwell in the 2006, but joined UKIP in 2013.

His new party has been plagued with accusations of racism following comments made by some members.

Leader Nigel Farage recently said immigrants from Romania were more likely to be criminals than people from other countries.

But Mr Hearn, a school premises manager at Roding Valley High School in Loughton, believes Ukip is the only party "prepared to address people's concerns".

The 50-year-old said: "I wouldn't belong to a racist party and as you know we do not take members of BNP or the national front.

The main priorities set out by the party include introducing local referendums on major planning applications and service provision decisions.

The party has also pledged to give local people priority over housing, protect green belt land from development and keep council tax frozen.

There seems to be a concerted effort from the media of all leanings to discredit the UKIP bandwagon and the likes of James O'brien hijacking the Farage interview as though he was David Frost interviewing Nixon.

Truth is everyone of all parties are terrified that they will be given a bloody nose by Farage and they probably will as there is no other party willing to address the burden of mass immigration into the UK and the strain this is causing on the country's infrastructure and jobs.

Nah, you've got that wrong Cornbeefur - the real problem is caused by the green toothed lefties on the Orford Road and the children dressed as darleks.

C'mon, if you're going continue to troll this site, you've really got to raise your game!

In my opinion,if people vote UKIP,in the local elections, this will mean,we will end up with a Labour controlled,council.

If residents are happy with Redbridge Council ,it would be a shame to lose hard working Conservative Councillors.

I am proud to be voting Conservative,on the 22-May-2014.

Hopefully,we will have a Conservative controlled Council,after the election on Thursday.

You are the sadder!

As for trolling, you are a fine example!

I rest my case!

But we will never rest Cornbeefur, we will never rest.
