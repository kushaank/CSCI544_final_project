
German stocks fell, after the benchmark DAX Index rallied for a third week, as banks declined and investors weighed equity valuations.

Deutsche Bank AG dropped 1.8 percent after selling about 60 million shares to the Qatari royal family as it announced plans to raise 8 billion euros ($11 billion) in its second-biggest capital increase. Commerzbank slid 4 percent. Adidas AG retreated after Chief Executive Officer Herbert Hainer told Sueddeutsche Zeitung the company may need longer to meet its 2015 sales and profit-margin targets.

The DAX lost 0.7 percent to 9,564.17 at 11:50 a.m. in Frankfurt. The benchmark gauge rose 2.4 percent in the past three weeks amid increased mergers-and-acquisitions activity and the European Central Bankâ€™s pledge to ease monetary policy next month if necessary. The HDAX Index slipped 0.6 percent today.

The DAX Index trades at 13.3 times the projected earnings of its members, higher than the five-year average of 11.9, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The volume of shares changing hands today in DAX-listed companies was 34 percent greater than the 30-day average for this time of the day, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
