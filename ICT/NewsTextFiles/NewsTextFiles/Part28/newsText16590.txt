
Martin Schulz, the centre-left's candidate to lead the European  Commission after EU parliamentary elections this month, has joined calls  for Google's market dominance to be subject to strict regulation.

Two  days ago Germany's Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said a ruling by a  top European court on Tuesday that Internet firms can be made to remove  irrelevant or excessive personal information from the web was a "wake  up" call for digital safeguards.

Germany was considering if firms  such as Google were abusing their market leader position he said. Google  has declined to comment.

"Whoever knows everything about  citizens, firms and politicians achieves a level of power which doesn't  belong in a pluralistic democracy," Schulz, who is president of the  European parliament, told Reuters in Berlin.

Besides concerns  about what data it displays, the world's top Internet search engine  Google has also faced difficulties over anti-trust issues and how it  shows competitors' information.

Google reached a deal with EU antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia in February by agreeing to display  rivals' links more prominently, hoping to end a three-year-old case that  could have led to a fine of up to $5 billion (3.6 billion euros).

Rivals  say Google's concessions do not go far enough and will only entrench  its dominance of Internet searches. EU regulators plan to issue a final  decision after the summer break.

Google recently started receiving  take-down requests after an EU Court upheld the 'Right to be forgotten'  law. The company said it would take weeks to devise a way to comply  with a European Court of Justice ruling that it honour requests to be  "forgotten."
