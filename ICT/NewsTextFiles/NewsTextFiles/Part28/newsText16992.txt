
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- Adelheid "Heidi" Gealt, director of the Indiana University Art Museum since 1987, has announced her retirement. She will assume the role of director emerita once a new director is chosen.

Bruce Cole, Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Art History and Comparative Literature and former chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, will chair the search committee to identify candidates for the new director.

"We thank Heidi for her many years of service as director," said Lauren Robel, provost of IU Bloomington and executive vice president. "Her leadership helped the museum grow into one of the nation’s finest university museums and one of Bloomington’s true cultural gems."

The IU Art Museum’s mission is to preserve, exhibit, collect, research, publish and interpret original works of art to advance the academic goals of Indiana University and to enrich the cultural lives and spiritual well-being of society.

Established in 1941, the IU Art Museum is one of the foremost university art museums in the United States. It houses a wide variety of internationally acclaimed collections, including ancient gold jewelry, African masks and paintings by Claude Monet and Pablo Picasso. More than 40,000 objects from nearly every art-producing culture in human history are under the museum’s stewardship.

Cole served as NEH chairman from 2001 to 2009, making him the longest-serving chairman in the organization’s history. President George W. Bush awarded him the Presidential Citizens Medal in 2008, and President Barack Obama appointed him to the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Commission in 2013.

Beginning in summer 2014, the search committee will launch a national search to identify, recruit and interview candidates for the position of director. Its goal will be to hire a new director who will begin July 1, 2015.
