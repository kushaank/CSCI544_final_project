
SALT LAKE CITY â€” A college degree opens doors, but finding the money to get a degree can be difficult.

Some unusual scholarships may put some fun into the stress of paying for college. Thousands of them are available and many have rarely been used because few people know about them.

If you want college money and have an interest in language, here's the scholarship for you. It's called the Kor Memorial Scholarship from the Klingon Language Institute . You don't have to speak Klingon to win $500 but it might not hurt.

A scholarship from Tall Clubs International will get you $1,000. But it's a tall order. Men must be at least 6 foot, 2 inches tall. Women need to be at least 5 foot, 10-inches.

If your last name is Zolp, you're Catholic and plan to study at Loyola University in Chicago, you could win the Zolp scholarship .

Teens with a flair for fashion and duct tape have until this Friday to enter the Stuck-at-Prom contest. A panel of Duck Brand judges chooses the winning duds made out of duct tape based on a number of criteria: workmanship, use of color and originality. The designs that stick with the judges the most can earn their wearers up to $10,000 in scholarship money.

Finally, students who have the knack for summoning fowl should think about the Chick and Sophie Major Memorial Duck Calling Contest . Held every year in Stuttgart, Arkansas, the top winner flies away with a $2,000 scholarship. It's serious competition. The students have 90 seconds to use four calls.

Experts suggest don't just look for the usual scholarships, but ask school counselors or even search the Internet for non-traditional scholarships that may meet your interests.
