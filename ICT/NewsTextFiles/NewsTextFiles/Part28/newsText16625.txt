
No charges have yet been filed in an alleged sexual assault at a Cross Plains restaurant, more than a year and nine months after it was reported.

District Attorney Ismael Ozanne said he still hoped to review raw video of an interview done with the 42-year-old alleged victim by WISC-TV, despite a judge’s ruling last year that he could not force the station to turn over the video.

The woman told police that she went to pick up a carryout order at the Cinco de Mayo restaurant on Aug. 3, 2012. The restaurant has since closed.

She said her food was not ready, so she was given a margarita to drink, then felt “cloudy in the head” and was taken to a bed in a back room where she said she was raped by several men.

Police in Cross Plains recommended first-degree sexual assault charges against a 23-year-old man, who has since left the area.

In May 2013, then-Dane County Circuit Judge Rebecca St. John ruled that Ozanne had not met his burden under the state’s shield law for journalists to compel disclosure of the video. She wrote that Ozanne had not shown by clear and convincing evidence that information in the video was relevant and necessary and not available anywhere else, or that there was a public interest in its disclosure.
