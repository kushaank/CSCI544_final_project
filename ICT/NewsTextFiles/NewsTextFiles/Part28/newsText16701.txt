
Anti-coup students staged a demonstration on the Ain Shams University campus to protest a presidential bid by former defense minister Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi –  the architect of Morsi's ouster last summer.

A student was injured on Monday when a homemade bomb exploded in Ain Shams University's campus in eastern Cairo during a demonstration by student supporters of ousted president Mohamed Morsi.

The injury of the student was described as "slight," but the blast nevertheless caused panic inside the university and among students.

Anti-coup students staged a demonstration on the Ain Shams University campus to protest a presidential bid by former defense minister Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi – the architect of Morsi's ouster last summer.

Egypt will hold its first post-Morsi presidential election on May 26-27, with two candidates – al-Sisi and leftist politician Hamdeen Sabahi – vying for highest office.

Anti-coup students also demonstrated against al-Sisi's presidential bid at Al-Azhar University in eastern Cairo, Menoufiya University in the Nile Delta, and Al-Azhar University's branch in the Nile Delta province of Daqahliya.

Students chanted against the Egyptian military and flashed the four-fingered "Rabaa salute," which commemorates hundreds of Morsi's supporters killed last August when security forces violently dispersed their protest camps in Cairo and Giza.

Since the beginning of the academic year last September, Egyptian universities have become epicenters of protest against Egypt's army-backed interim authorities, with scores of students having since been thrown in jail for taking part in anti-government rallies.
