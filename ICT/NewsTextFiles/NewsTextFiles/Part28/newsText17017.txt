
Forget the “war on women.” American Enterprise Institute scholar Christina Hoff Sommers says that there’s a “war on boys” unfolding in America’s public school classrooms.

Sommers says it’s past time to make elementary schools more friendly to boys, and she has four ways to do that: turn boys into readers; inspire their imagination; get rid of zero-tolerance policies; and bring recess back.

She noted that boys score lower than girls on reading measures and says they need adventurous content tailored to their interests. She heralded the importance of inspiring the male imagination — something that can be done by embracing the themes they care about.

Boys fall behind, she argues, because schools chastise them for activities and themes they are inclined to care about.

Sommers mentioned the story of a boy who got in trouble for drawing a picture of a sword fight and another child who was suspended last year after chewing his breakfast treat into the shape of a gun to highlight what she says are out-of control policies.
