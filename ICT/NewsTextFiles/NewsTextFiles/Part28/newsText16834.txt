SPRING HILL â€“ On Thursday, residents can find out more about how a small Franklin-based college is reaching out to help Williamson County inmates have a better chance at employment after jail.

Williamson College has partnered with the Williamson County Sheriff's Department and Jail on "The Promise Program" to offer a one-year program of business, ethics, leadership and information technology classes to inmates.

Todd Bradley, vice president of academic affairs and dean at Williamson College, will be the featured speaker at the Spring Hill Chamber of Commerce's monthly luncheon Thursday. Bradley will explain "The Promise Program" and the school's efforts to give back to the community.

The 16-year-old school is a nonprofit, nondenominational Christian liberal arts college that offers associate's, bachelor's and master's degrees.

The luncheon is 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Northfield Workforce Development and Conference Center, 5000 Northfield Lane, in south Spring Hill. Catering will be provided.
