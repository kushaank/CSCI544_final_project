
Twenty students at Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar (WCMC-Q) moved a step closer to realising the dream of becoming a doctor when they completed the college’s Foundation Programme.

The Foundation Programme helps students raise their English-language skills to the level required for the pre-medical programme and medical school, and also provides a strong grounding in the sciences.

The aim is to ensure that the students have the best chance of success if accepted onto WCMC-Q’s pre-medical programme.

The Foundation Programme students, the majority of whom are Qatari, received their completion certificates in front of friends and family members at a special ceremony at WCMC-Q recently.

Dr Rachid Bendriss, assistant dean for Student Recruitment, Outreach and Foundation Programmes, said the students deserved to be proud of themselves. He said, “Despite an infinite amount of homework, an increasing number of tests, math and reading projects, you were patient and persistent and highly motivated to march on to success.

“You all have admirable personal attributes and talents that will contribute to your success in whatever you do in the future.

Dr Bendriss and Dr Marco Ameduri, associate dean for Pre-Medical Education, presented the students with certificates marking their completion of the Foundation Programme.
