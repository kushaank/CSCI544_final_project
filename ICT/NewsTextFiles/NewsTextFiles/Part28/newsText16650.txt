SANTO DOMINGO. The Senate has set a fixed deadline of a month for the report of a special commission which is studying the proposal to declare as law that Loma Miranda is a National Park, following the request of Senator Euclides Sanchez to reject the proposal as the report had not been made in the time laid down as established by internal rules.

The decision was approved by 19 of the 24 Senators after a prolonged debate, with some in favor and some against setting a deadline.

The Senator for La Vega was critical of the fact that the last report the special commission presented was December 11 and they then had 30 days to present their final report, which they did not do. For this reason, it was firstly suggested that the commission be disbanded under Article 282 of the Senate's rules.

Then it was proposed that they were set a two week deadline to submit their final report which was opposed by Senators Prin Pujols, Aristides Victoria Yeb, Jose Rafael Sosa and Ruben Dario Cruz.

Senator Juan Orlando Mercedes warned that at some time they had to resolve the issue as there was a need to put an end to the uncertainty which existed.

On the other hand, the Senate approved in a second session the legal proposal, submitted by the Executive Branch, which authorizes the provisional participation of the State as promoter, principal and/or owner, directly or indirectly, in the activity of the generation of electricity via the Dominican Corporation of State Electricity Companies (CDEEE).
