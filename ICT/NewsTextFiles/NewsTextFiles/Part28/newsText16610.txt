
There is no sell-by date on products such as vinegar and chewing gum. European food ministers now want to see if this can be extended to other foodstuffs.

Dan Jørgensen (SocDem), the Danish Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, and a number of his colleagues in the European Union think that fewer foodstuffs should be marked with a “sell by” date. They will meet today to discuss the options.

The main aim is to reduce food wastage, although the consumer advice bureau Tænk does not think that more products with no sell-by date will make much difference.

However, senior adviser, Camilla Udsen is concerned that if the sell-by date is removed from some products, it will lead to outdated goods on supermarket shelves, thus transferring the question of waste from the supermarket to the home.

“We think that this will mean that there will be older goods on supermarket shelves that will just go off quicker once you get them home. So the problem is the same,” she said.

“It is important that shops have efficient stock management so they sell products before they become out of date,” she added.

However, Udsen agrees with the minister that there are a number of products that keep longer that their stated sell-by date.
