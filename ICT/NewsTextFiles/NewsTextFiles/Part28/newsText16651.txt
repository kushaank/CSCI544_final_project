
Santo Domingo.- As early as today a National District Land Court judge could rule for the State and nullity the titles obtained by hundreds of people who claim ownership of an area nearly 50 square kilometers in the southwest that include seven kilometers of the pristine beach at Bahia de las Aguilas.

Central Dept. 8th Chamber judge Alba Beard Marcos subpoenaed more than 600 people to appear for the hearing at 9am, where Justice minister Francisco Domínguez is expected to take the stand in what’s considered Dominican Republic’s biggest ever land theft case.

Central Dept. Land Jurisdiction prosecutor Fermín Casilla said the State will motion the court to order a criminal trial, after the prosecution complied with all of the judge’s requirements.

There are more than 1,200 questioned titles in the hands of people in the area of Jaragua and Sierra de Bahoruco national parks. The same issued to persons declared as owners of lands between the towns of Enriquillo and Oviedo in Barahona province, and Bahia de las Aguilas, Pedernales province.

600 people!? That's just asking for it!

I guess tomorrow we'll be reading about the riot that ensued.
