
WASHINGTON -- A study conducted by the University of  Massachusetts Amherst and the  University of Washington finds that college students are less concerned with driving  while high on marijuana than driving while intoxicated.

Some 315 college freshmen were asked whether they've used marijuana and driven a  vehicle  in the past month, and how many of them have been in a vehicle with someone who's  used marijuana.

Boston Globe health blogger Deborah Kotz says about half the male students, and more  than a third of female students have ridden in a vehicle with someone who  was high.

Still, there's no effective sobriety test for motorists high on marijuana. According to the study, more college students have been driven by someone  high on marijuana than by someone who's been drinking.
