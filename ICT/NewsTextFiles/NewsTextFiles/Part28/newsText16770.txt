The gun was .38 revolver. There was no ammunition in the gun, Bishop said.

Bishop said no one else at the school saw the gun before police found it. He also said the student had not threatened do anything with the gun.

The student told police he put the gun in his backpack over the weekend and forgot it was there, Bishop said.

"We are still working on that — exactly where it came from and all," Bishop said.
