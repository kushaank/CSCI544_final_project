
FRANKFORT, Ky. (WKYT) - Labor law posters are required to be displayed in every workplace. The posters are available for free through the Kentucky Labor Cabinet, but private companies are trying to profit off those posters. Cabinet officials want employers to save their money and get the posters through their office.

The companies are threatening $17,000 government fines if they are not purchased.

"The Kentucky Labor Cabinet provides them for free on our website," said Daniel Lowry, Labor Cabinet, Director of Communications.

Lowry says the cabinet received hundreds of calls from employers this year. He says it’s always been a problem, but this year it has been exceptionally worse.

Managers at Adelia's Bakery and Café in Frankfort are already covered. Manager Chris Simms says they are contacted two to three times a month by companies selling posters.

"We just throw them away because we don't need them," said Simms.

The state fine for not displaying a labor law poster ranges from $100 to $1,000.
