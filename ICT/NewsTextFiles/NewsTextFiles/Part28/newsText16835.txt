
The Wildwood Early Childhood Center is a school that serves preschool and kindergarten students. Wildwood takes pride in the music program at their school, especially the fact that their students are exposed to the arts as such an early age. The students participate in two performances each year in the winter and spring.

Thaddeus Bell is the music teacher working with the students, who participate in music class once a week for 30 minutes. Children work on basic, foundational skills related to music, such as rhythm and song. There are no instruments formally taught at this age level.

The "Celebrate Wilmington" concert is a performance for kindergarten students only.

All of the children are participating in the concert during two performances. On Wednesday, May 14, students will perform at 9:30 a.m. and 12:45.p.m. Four classes will perform in one show and three classes will perform in the other show.

"The teachers love to be able to teach their students about the town of Wilmington. It is great to be able to begin instilling �Wildcat Pride� in our young students, beginning in kindergarten," said Kristin O�Toole, who teaches kindergarten.

The program includes the following selections: Our World, Our Continent, Our Country, Our State and Our Town. Prior to the concert, students participated in a unit of study in their classroom that covers the town of Wilmington. They learned about the history of their town, landmarks and the various members of the community who help the town run. The teachers also organized a �Mini Town Meeting� for the students. Wilmington Fire Lt. Dan Hurley, Wilmington Police Officer Brian Moon, Town Manager Jeffery Hull, Superintendent Joanne Benton and Woburn Street Elementary Principal Jeffery Strasnick visited the school and told students about their jobs, and then answered their questions.

A list of the song selections for the presentation are: Hello to All the Children of the World, He�s Got the Whole World in His Hands, Seven Continents, You�re a Grand Old Flag, This Land is Your Land, My Country �tis of Thee, God Bless the U.S.A., Massachusetts, Baldwin Apple, Silver Lake, Flat Stanley and How Could Anyone.

Erin Burke, Head Teacher comments, "The �Celebrate Wilmington Concert� is a true, collaborative effort between our entire kindergarten staff, our Music Teacher, and the community."
