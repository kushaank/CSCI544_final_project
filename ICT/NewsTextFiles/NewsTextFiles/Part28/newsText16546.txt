
Erno Rubik's cube consists of 26 miniature cubes all of which are internally interlocked and can be twisted and turned row-wise in the desired direction. Each cubelet cannot be individually moved and has to be worked on in a row. The aim of the puzzle is to ring all the cubelets of a particular colour to form a square on one side of the cube. The cube originally comes with 6 colours: red, white, green, blue, yellow and orange.

The first ever Rubik's Cube solving competition was held by the Guinness Book of World Records in Munich in 1981. Called Speedcubing, the contest was won by a Munich national. The international competitionÂ was held in Budapest on June 5, 1982, and was won by Minh Thai, a Vietnamese student from Los Angeles, with a time of 22.95 seconds.
