
Students at the University of South Carolina Upstate are learning on location for the next 12 days.

Nine students enrolled in the Honors College at the University left May 13 to study in Greece and Turkey, as part of an Honors Program, directed by Dr. Catherine Canino,  professor of English.

The program starts in the ancient city of Athens, where students will visit the Parthenon, the Temple of Athena Nike and the Acropolis Museum. The group will then drive to Delphi for a visit to the Archaelogical Museum, the Temple of Apollo and the stadium.

The group will drive to Olympia, the site of the first Olympic games. Students will also make stops in Epidaurus and Mycenae, before boarding a four-night cruise with excursions to Mykonos, Ephesus, Patmos, Rhodes and Crete.

The following students are traveling with Dr. Canino: Ashley Jordan Moore of Greer, Alexandra Grace Wells of Sumter, Zantrell Harrison of Hueytown, Ala., La’Porscha Smalls of Walterboro, Sherry Kay Kearns of Simpsonville, Erika Renee Montgomery of Taylors, Chelsea Hannah Brown, Esther-Irene Egan of Spartanburg and Connor Gerard Bush of Columbia.

In order to participate in the trip, each of the students had to be enrolled in the Honors College, maintain a 3.25 GPA and complete an essay on what they hoped to learn during this trip.

Upon return, each of the students will make a two-minute presentation on what impacted them most about the trip and share photos of their journey.
