For students in a web authoring class at Wheeling Jesuit University, skills they learned will be showcased via incorporation on the university’s web site.

After a semester of learning many different design elements and ways of coding web pages, the 23 members of Jay Good’s class wrapped up the year presenting their project – a new design of the WJU Community Day photo gallery. Good, adjunct professor of communications, decided to incorporate the expertise of Chris Kreger, manager of WJU web services, and Audra Macri,web services specialist, into the class.

Kreger and Macri also provided the students real world experience to produce a product, rather than the class being solely theory based.

“I believe that Audra and I gave the students an understanding of how to communicate with the client and ask the right questions with the understanding the project was for the university, not them as individuals. We also wanted them to learn how to work on a large project as teams,” Kreger said.

Good said an additional advantage of the course was that each student was able to produce a project that he or she can use as a portfolio piece. The plan is to incorporate some of the photo galleries that were created in the web authoring class into the WJU web site, Macri said.
