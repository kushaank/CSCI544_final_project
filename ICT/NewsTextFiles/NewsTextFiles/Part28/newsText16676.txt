
WORCESTER (AP) -- A man from Ecuador charged with dragging a Milford motorcyclist to his death under his pickup truck has been found not guilty of second-degree murder, but has been convicted of less serious charges.

A judge on Monday found 37-year-old Nicolas Dutan Guaman guilty of manslaughter by motor vehicle in the August 2011 death of 23-year-old Mathew Denice.

Prosecutors say Guaman was drunk and driving without a license when hit Denice's motorcycle. Denice was dragged nearly one-quarter of a mile even as witnesses banged on the side of Guaman's pickup.

Guaman was living in the U.S. illegally and the death sparked a fierce debate in Massachusetts about immigration enforcement.

Judge David Ricciardone presided over the jury-waived trial in Worcester Superior Court.

Guaman's lawyer said his client was unaware Denice was pinned in the truck's wheel well.
