
ADVANCE  -- The Advance R-4 School District is one of five school districts in Missouri proposed by Gov. Jay Nixon for a tornado safe room.

Nixon announced today he has authorized the State Emergency Management Agency to proceed with proposals for tornado safe rooms at schools in Lincoln, St. Charles, Stoddard, Texas and Webster counties.

"Missouri's children are our most precious and important resource, and ensuring that they not only receive a good education, but that they are safe and secure in their schools should be our top priority," Nixon said. "We have seen too often the devastation that tornadoes and severe weather can bring to communities in Missouri and neighboring states, and that's why I'm committed to utilizing available funding wherever possible to help build community safe rooms, particularly in our schools."

The safe room proposed in Stoddard County would be 6,700 square feet. It would shelter about 1,000 people.

Community safe rooms are specially designed and engineered structures built to withstand 250-mile per hour winds, often utilizing 14-inch precast concrete and steel-reinforced doors. Walls and roof sections are capable of withstanding impacts from windborne debris that can act as missiles.
