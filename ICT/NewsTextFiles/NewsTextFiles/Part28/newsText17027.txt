Dear O: You're FREE. Wait. This is going to be hard, but it's the most loving thing to do for yourself, your boyfriend and this relationship. Here's the reasoning - your boyfriend has been your No. 1 source of love and confidence since you were 14 years old. You've done the same for him. He's always been there for you. You've always been there for him. Taking a break means having time to stand on your own two feet as individuals. It's time to figure out who you are and what you want. Don't feel guilty or regretful. But do expect to feel sad, scared and lonely. This doesn't mean you need to run back to him for the rest of your life - it means you need to learn how to love yourself so you can decide if you want him and this relationship for the rest of your life.

Dear Online Student: Tell her to spend less time complaining and more time working. Yes, this professor might be absolutely awful, but hating her will not improve her grade. Your friend needs to understand the comments and criticism and work to address the problem. A horrible professor can be a gift. It makes a student have to deal with real-life situations. Coworkers, bosses and clients are not always agreeable. Encourage her to give her professor permission to be flawed and move forward. If things just don't get better or codes of conduct are broken, she can get a dean or supervisor involved, but she's better off changing her attitude instead of trying to change her professor.
