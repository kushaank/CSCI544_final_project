
Established for nearly 3 years, Harmoni is a one-stop boutique in central Lincoln offering a range of beauty treatments, makeup and fashion.

If you're tired of hectic high-street shopping and are looking for a more unique experience, Harmoni combines exclusive products with personal one-to-one service. Business owner Sharon Wood is a fully qualified beauty therapist and offers a range of relaxing treatments to get you looking and feeling wonderful.

All products have been hand-picked for their quality ingredients or antioxidant properties that help your skin to fight aging and rejuvenate tired features. There's also a wide range of fashion to browse, including Danish brands Masai and LauRie who specialise in beautiful contemporary layering, airy tops, and trousers in various lengths including cropped – just perfect for those balmy summer days. And with sizing from XS to XXL, there's something to suit every shape. Compliment your outfit perfectly with Gracie J's jewellery designs, inspired by the constellations.
