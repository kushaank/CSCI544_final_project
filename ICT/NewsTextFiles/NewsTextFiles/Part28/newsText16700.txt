
Taipei, May 19 (CNA) President Ma Ying-jeou will pledge to provide affordable residence units for young people when he speaks at China Medical University in Taichung Tuesday to mark the beginning of his seventh year in office, a Presidential Office source said.

The choice of a university campus represents Ma's intention to focus on issues of concern for young people during his Tuesday address, including housing prices, salaries and employment, the source said.

As at past anniversaries of his inauguration as president on May 20, 2008, the president will give an address and hold a press conference.

Ma also plans to interact with the school's students and solicit their opinions on current policies through a question-and-answer session.

In his speech, Ma will vow to make Taiwan a place where young people can afford to live. He will announce a series of preferential policies for young and disadvantaged people, including rental subsidies, affordable social housing for rent only, and housing units at 70 percent of market prices, according to the Presidential Office.

The president will also stress the necessity of Taiwan's participation in regional economic integration to maintain its economic development.

He will also introduce a NT$17 billion program to encourage young people to start up businesses, with 2,400 companies expected to be set up within three years, according to the Presidential Office.
