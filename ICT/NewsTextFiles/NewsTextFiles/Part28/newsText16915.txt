
JAIPUR: Admissions in any affiliated college of  Rajasthan University would not be a cakewalk for even those students who score in 90% or above. Owing it to the better results of the state board, the university administration is expecting a slight increase in the cut-offs.

Board officials said number of students scoring in the 90% range has risen by 2% this year, which will eventually shoot up the overall cut-off. For instance, Maharani's College B. Com. Cut-off touched 92.80% last year, which was higher than many Delhi University colleges.

Every year, the number of students is increasing with a rate of 8% making the fight tougher for the students to get admission. In 2013, over 53,000 students applied for the 27,000 seats in the Rajasthan University and its affiliated colleges. No wonder if this year the number will swell to 60,000.

In Maharani's College alone, the number of seats is 2,880 and number of forms sold was around 13,000. "Such is the prestige of this college that students from western UP, Haryana and all parts of Rajasthan are heading here. Our seats are limited and we cannot accommodate all students," said Kanan Bala Sharma, principal, Maharani's College.

Similar is the situation in other colleges. The cut-off in  Commerce College had touched 87% while Rajasthan College was pegged at 85%.The first cut-off in all subjects in Maharaja's College was in the 80% range. It means that students, irrespective of streams, have to get 90% or above to ensure an admission here.

Aware of the high cut-offs, students have started inquiring about the colleges' last year cut-offs. "I am tensed over the high cut-off of Rajasthan University. I am wondering if I get anything below 90% which college will take me. Certainly not any good college," said Ritika Nagar, a class XII student.

The CBSE is expected to announce the class XII result on Wednesday.
