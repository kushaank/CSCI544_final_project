
AHMEDABAD: Prime Minister-designate Narendra Modi's hometown, Vadnagar, has grown into an education hub since he became Gujarat chief minister. It is now going to have a medical college. Modi's hometown was earlier known only as a temple town because of revered Hatkeshwar Temple.

Finance minister Nitin Patel will lay the foundation stone for the medical college at a ceremony near Arjun Bari Darwaza in Vadnagar on Tuesday. Officials said land had been acquired for the college sometime back and now the building for the medical college will be constructed. Sources said the medical college and hospital will cost Rs 118 crore.

"Vadnagar has a referral hospital which will be upgraded simultaneously into a state-of-the-art 250-bed hospital even as the college building is being constructed. The medical college will be attached to a 150-bed hospital," said an official.

Maninagar (in Ahmedabad), Modi's assembly constituency for the past 12 years, also has a medical college. Vadnagar residents say the medical college in their town will be Modi's biggest gift to his hometown.

When he was in college, Modi had to go to Visnagar for higher education. In 2004, as CM he approved CBSE Navoday Vidyamandir. The town has three government primary and secondary schools and one English-medium private school.

After Vadnagar Arts and Commerce College, Vadnagar Government Science College was established in 2012. In this college, 400 students pursue undergraduate studies in pure sciences.

Catering to the demand for a vocational college, Vadnagar Polytechnic College was established in 2009. This college offers diploma courses in mechanical, IT, and Electronics and Communication Engineering.

"Vadnagar has become an education hub in the past decade. Earlier, most students had to go out of the town for higher studies, either to Mehsana or Patan. This has changed. Now children of even poor parents are able to afford higher education," said Sunil Mehta, president of the Vadnagar municipality.
