
The University of Notre Dame awarded University of Iowa President Sally Mason an honorary doctor of laws degree during its commencement ceremony Sunday, May 18.

Mason was among six distinguished figures in business, the church, community leadership, education, engineering, and the performing arts that was honored at Notre Dame’s 169th commencement at Notre Dame Stadium.

“I am thrilled and deeply humbled to be honored by the University of Notre Dame along with so many extraordinarily talented and distinguished men and women,” Mason said.

The release says Mason began her academic career at University of Kansas and became dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences there in 1995. Six years later, she became the provost of Purdue before her appointment at Iowa in 2007.
