The sell-out night claims to offers students the 'best night of their lives'.

Some of the partygoers took a tumble and fell on the cobbled streets as a number of women struggled to stay upright in their heels.

A number of the students meanwhile called it a night at around 4am and poured into local take-away shops.

Police and paramedics were on hand throughout the night and kept a close eye on the event.
