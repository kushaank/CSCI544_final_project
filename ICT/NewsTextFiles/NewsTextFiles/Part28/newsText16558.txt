
The German word for “wicked” is ”böse”, but it looks like I’m going to need the online translation to find the Indian correspondent. That is, because BMW has just launched its all-new 2014 S1000R beast in the Indian market.

The 2014 S1000R is pretty much a semi-naked version of the smashing S1000RR superbike, retaining all the bike’s mean attire, despite the absent evil front cowl and the sleek fairing. Engineered to be a more streetable version of the RR machine, the S1000R has received a retuned engine which can deliver as much as 160 hp at 11,000 rpm, with a peak torque figure in the 112Nm (82 lb-ft) zone, at a lower 9.250 rpm. The torque peak of the S1000RR engine was shifted towards the lower rpm, with the semi-naked beast being in fact more torque under the 7,500 mark, than its racing sibling.

With an obvious focus on daily rides, the comfort was also improved, but Dynamic suspensions have remained an optional feature. Still, there’s plenty of technology present aboard the S1000R to provide riders with both increased safety and solid thrills. The Automatic Stability Control and high-performance Race ABS are stock, and so are the Rain and Road riding modes.

If you feel like you can do better and want to take the 2014 BMW S1000R on the track, then forking out some more money can also get you a Pro riding modem with Dynamic and Dynamic Pro maps to scorch the asphalt. BMW went for roadster-specific ergonomics, and wanted to keep the bike as light as possible, hence the presence of an aluminium tank which takes the S1000R to 207 kg (457 lbs) when full.
