
HAVERFORD, Pa. (AP) — A commencement speaker blasted Pennsylvania college students as "immature" and "arrogant" for protesting another speaker who then decided to withdraw.

William Bowen is former president of Princeton University. He used his commencement speech at Haverford College outside Philadelphia on Sunday to criticize students who campaigned against Robert Birgeneau, former chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley.

More than 40 students and three professors had protested Birgeneau's invitation to speak, objecting to his handling of a 2011 incident at Berkeley in which police used force at a student protest.

The Philadelphia Inquirer reports that Bowen said Birgeneau's withdrawal was a "defeat" for the university.

His address drew a standing ovation.
