
MOSCOW, May 19 (RIA Novosti) – Syria’s deadly conflict has claimed the lives of at least 162,000 people over the last three years, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) announced Monday.

According to a statement published on the organization’s website, 54,000 civilians, 62,800 Syrian soldiers and pro-government militia and 42,700 rebels have perished in the conflict. Thousands of people have been abducted and remain unaccounted for, the OSDH added.

Previous updates on the number of victims in Syria released by the OSDH in April said 150,000 people had been killed in the civil war.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has been maintaining records of violence in Syria since the very beginning of the world’s gravest humanitarian crisis.

Moscow, however, casts serious doubt on the reliability of the information provided by the organization. According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, the OSDH is run by only two people, including an interpreter, and its head and founder Rami Abdurrahman did not attend high school. In one of his interviews, Abdurrahman said that he lived in London where he owned a fast food establishment.

Fierce battles between the Syrian army and Islamist militants, including foreign mercenaries and al-Qaeda-affiliated groups have been ongoing in Syria since March 2011. Over 2.3 million Syrian citizens have been forced to flee the country; and some 6.5 million Syrians have been displaced within Syria.
