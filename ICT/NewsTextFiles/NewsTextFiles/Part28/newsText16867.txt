A proposal for five tornado safe rooms at school in Lincoln, St. Charles, Stoddard, Texas and Webster Counties in Missouri was authorized on Monday, May 19 to proceed.

Gov. Jay Nixon announced the authorization during a visit to Troy Buchanan High School.

In Stoddard County, a proposed 6,700 square foot safe room to shelter about 1,000 people was authorized for the Advance R-IV School. The school's superintendent, Dr. Stan Seiler, says this announcement means more safety not only for students, but the entire community.

Community safe rooms are designed and engineered structures built to withstand 250 mile per hour winds. They use 14-inch precast concrete and steel-reinforced doors. The walls and roof sections are capable of withstanding impacts from windborne debris that can act as missiles.

Missouri currently has 104 completed safe rooms across the state.

The FEMA program provides 75 percent of funding for pre-approved safe rooms projects that meet all design and construction standards. Local grant recipients pay the remaining 25 percent of safe room costs.

The federal share of the projects the governor announced on Monday is about $5.7 million. Local applicants still must meet all federal program requirements.
