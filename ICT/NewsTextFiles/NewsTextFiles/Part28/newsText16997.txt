
With ExxonMobil’s announcement that its joint venture-led Papua New Guinea’s Liquefied Natural Gas (PNG LNG) has started production ahead of schedule, there is officially a new LNG supplier to Asia. The $19 billion plant will supply 6.9 million tons per year (mtpa). Not surprisingly, nearly all this gas has been contracted.

At this point, it looks like the PNG LNG plant has escaped some of these challenges, particularly because of its competitive advantages. The project has substantial booked reserves with high liquid yields from onshore sources with an existing infrastructure base for oil developments, a great location relative to the growing Asian LNG markets, and a fair fiscal regime that is backed by a government that is keen for new revenue streams.

According to an economic impact study completed by ACIL Tasman, when the project is in production it will more than double Papua New Guinea’s GDP and triple export revenues. Harvard’s Kennedy School conducted a study in 2013 estimating that some 20 to 30 billion PNG Kina (the local currency, or about $7.5 to $11.7 billion at May 2014 exchange rates) will accrue to the national government over the projected 30-year operation.

It appears ExxonMobil’s long-term view has proven accurate.
