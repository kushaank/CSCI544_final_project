
FAIRBANKS - Arbor Day began April 10, 1872. It was the idea of Julius Sterling Morton, who thought trees would greatly benefit the Nebraska prairie by binding its soil, and eventually supply a source of lumber, according to Celebrate Arbor Day, a guide released by the University of Alaska Fairbanks Cooperative Extension Service.

On the inaugural Arbor Day more then 1 million trees were planted.

Within the next three years Kansas, Tennessee and Minnesota celebrated Arbor Day, Ohio followed in 1882.

Cultivation of Arbor Day spread fastest in schools, the guide states. In 1885 the National Education Association adopted a resolution asking all schools to observe Arbor Day, it followed a similar proclamation by the American Forestry Congress.

Alaska's Arbor Day was established by state law in 1966, and in 1973 the law was amended to change the date from the first to the third Monday in May. The FADC has been organizing tree-planting events since 1983.
