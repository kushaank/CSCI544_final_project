Bryn Timmis, from Canyon Del Oro High School was recently awarded a scholarship for winning a national recipe contest.  He is just one of three high school students to win this honor, according to a recent release.

The award is from the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) for their Small Plates Super Foods Recipe contest, co-sponsored with the Careers through Culinary Arts Program (C-CAP).

The contest winners all successfully developed appetizers or small plates that met AICR's evidence-based guidelines on eating for lower cancer risk -- highlighting fruits, vegetables, and other cancer-protective plant foods.

To see Bryn's and other winning recipes go online to www.aicr.org/ccap .

"AICR is proud to play a part in helping tomorrow's chefs learn the skills they'll need to create dishes that highlight the variety of tastes, textures – and health benefits – of plant foods," said AICR's Senior Vice-President for Programs Deirdre McGinley-Gieser, in the recent release. "These students were challenged to create delicious dishes that let their ingredients' natural flavors shine through. We're delighted with the results."

2014 is only the second year AICR has awarded scholarships as part of the Super Foods Recipe Contest; desserts were the focus in 2013.
