
NEW MILFORD --  Beef rindsrouladen, a variety of schnitzels, sauerbraten, and spaetzle are among the authentic offerings at a new German restaurant that opened its doors along Bank Street.

"When people come in I want them to feel they are in The Alps," said Manuela Young , owner of The Alpenhaus, which opened earlier this month. "The smell of the food, the pictures on the wall: My goal is to have my patrons experience Germany with all six senses."

Young's husband, Jeff Yenter , remodeled the restaurant that most recently housed 59 Bank, a popular restaurant for more than a decade until it closed in December. The interior exposed brick walls remain with decor touches that are traditionally Bavarian to complete the transformation.

Young, who grew up in Flensbury, Germany, held a soft opening of the restaurant on May 6 with more than 60 guests, including Mayor Pat Murphy , who had lived in Germany for more than nine years during her service in the U.S. Army .

"Eating there really brought me back to Germany, the flavors of the food there," Murphy said, "even the salad dressing had the taste of Germany. And the butter-dipped cheese curds are amazing."

Young hopes to please new customers like Murphy as well as the customer base she created running the Cafe Litte Europe, a Brookfield eatery that closed in 2012. Young said she opened the new restaurant in New Milford with the urging of customers from the cafe.

The Alpenhaus' chef, Stefan Kappes , and Young created the restaurant's menu that includes many of the favorite dishes from Little Europe.

"If there's something special you like, it is possible to make it," Young said. "Say rusty potatoes with your meal. Tell me when you make your reservation and I can have them for you."
