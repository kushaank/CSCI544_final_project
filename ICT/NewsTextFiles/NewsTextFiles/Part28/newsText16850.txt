
Hastings College's 2014 graduating class is ready to tackle the world, and officials say they're an impressive group.

Hundreds of people packed Lynn Farrell Arena Saturday morning, to watch 239 students graduate at the 128th commencement ceremony at Hastings College.

A lot has happened on their campus in the past four years, including three different college presidents, but despite the changes students say they're ready for the next chapter.

And campus officials add that the sense of growth and leadership present throughout this class, it's a class to watch.

Oleg Kalinskiy, a 1998 international student alumni from Russia, delivered the keynote address at Saturday's commencement ceremony, which also honored the graduating class of 1964.
