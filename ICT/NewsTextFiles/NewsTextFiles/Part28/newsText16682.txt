
The Galapagos Islands were named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1978.

The Galapaface I freighter veered off course last week, causing it to be stranded along the rocky shores of San Cristobal, one of the Galapagos Islands. Although recovery teams were able to remove much of the ship’s contents, including 19,000 gallons of diesel oil from the ship’s engine, which could have caused a severe oil spill and disrupted marine life from miles away, there is still room for concern.

The government of Ecuador declared an emergency in the Galapagos Islands, aware that the ship can still severely damage the frail ecosystem of the island chain, which suffered from a sizable oil spill near San Cristobal in 2001 .
