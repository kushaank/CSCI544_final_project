
Weston Middle School has been chosen to receive $1,779 to support its Fuel Up to Play 60 initiative, according to the New England Dairy & Food Council.

Weston Middle School was selected from hundreds of schools across the country that applied for funding to help them jumpstart and sustain healthy nutrition and physical activity improvements.

This nationwide funding program offers schools up to $4,000 to help them increase awareness of and access to nutrient-rich foods and physical activity opportunities for students.

Funds provide support for a variety of activities and tools, such as foodservice materials and equipment, nutrition and physical education materials, student and staff incentives, and staff development.

Funding is provided by New England Dairy & Food Council and the dairy farmers of Massachusetts.

At Weston Middle School, the funds will be used to purchase a blender to incorporate smoothies at the Grab n� Go station during lunch. The smoothies will be paired with granola and veggie sticks, and the goal will be to work up to offering the smoothies two to three times per week.

To encourage student participation, the school will provide incentives during their smoothie kickoff week. Each student who purchases a smoothie during the first week will be eligible to win a Weston Gear T-shirt, which will be given to three lucky winners.

Once up and running, the school is planning to organize smoothie recipe contests encouraging students to apply their nutrition knowledge to create delicious and healthy smoothies to be featured at the Grab n� Go station.

"Approximately half of our Middle School students participated in the lunch program during the 2012-13 school year," said Megan Bettencourt, nutrition analyst and Farm to School coordinator for Weston Public Schools. "We hope introducing smoothies to the popular Grab n� Go station will spark enthusiasm for our lunch program and help increase participation."

The Fuel Up to Play 60 program (FuelUpToPlay60.com) encourages youth to consume nutrient-dense foods and achieve at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day.

"We are very excited that Fuel Up to Play 60 has taken off in Weston," said Jill Read, nutrition specialist for New England Dairy & Food Council. "Our hope is that wellness champions and students in the Weston schools will embrace the program, and these funds will help Weston Middle School do even more."
