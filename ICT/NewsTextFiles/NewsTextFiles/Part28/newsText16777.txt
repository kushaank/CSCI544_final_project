
MILFORD � What could have been a contentious Town Meeting on Monday night will now likely be routine as two of the major articles town officials were divided on were resolved at meetings last week.

The two most controversial of the 38 warrants on the annual Town Meeting warrant included one to place 200 acres of town-owned land into a trust and another to approve $4.6 million to renovate the armory.

At the selectmen�s meeting last week, Selectmen Chairman Dino DeBartolomeis switched his vote on the land trust issue and allowed Selectman William Buckley to put forward a motion to place the�eight parcels of land located off�Dilla Street under Conservation Commission control.

The change came after the Finance Committee and Planning Board voiced their concern over the proposal. The Conservation Commission and Board of Health had voted to support it.

Article 24, which seeks to appropriate funds to renovate the armory on Pearl Street that currently houses the Milford Youth Center, will also likely no longer be a debate at Town Meeting after Buckley, who had opposed it, decided to support it after a Finance Committee meeting last week.

Buckley had raised concerns after the cost of the renovation nearly doubled from initial estimates to $4.6 million. He said he�d rather wait to consider whether the youth center could use space in the soon-to-be-vacant Middle School East building rather than putting money into the renovation.

Selectman Brian Murray and other members of the Armory Renovation Committee presented the plan for the armory to the Finance Committee last week and won over Buckley in the process.

Buckley said he wished their presentation had been available sooner because it thoroughly explained why Middle School East wouldn�t be a suitable home for the youth center. He said he�ll now be supporting the plan.

Town Meeting was also set to consider a $2.9 million planned expansion at Blackstone Valley Regional Technical High School, set to cost the town $16,000 in the first year, that had received a favorable recommendation by the Finance Committee. Five other member towns have already voted down the proposal at their town meetings, so the expansion project will not be moving forward.

Other articles on the warrant include $15,000 to perform a needs assessment for a town-wide geographic information system and $125,000 for the Highway Surveyor to continue working on storm water management compliance and mapping.

Town Meeting will take place on Monday at 7:30 p.m. in Upper Town Hall.
