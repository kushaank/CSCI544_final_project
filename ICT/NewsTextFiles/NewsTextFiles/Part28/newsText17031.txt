NORMANDY, Mo. (KSDK) – All seven members of the Normandy School District Board of Education voted to reject Senate Bill 493 (also known as the Transfer Bill) Saturday during a closed-door meeting.

"Since reviewing the bill, we have serious concerns about our financial future as well as the education Normandy students will receive if their test scores are not counted for five years in the receiving districts that reduce their tuition rates," the resolution reads.

Senate Bill 493 is best known for capping tuition unaccredited districts would pay receiving districts to accept their transfers – and it would also prevent DESE from lapsing Normandy and merging it with another district.

"We were hoping for a concrete solution that would not only address the tuition fees we are forced to pay monthly as a result of the current Transfer law, but also would provide viable supports for the Normandy School District and its students," said William Humphrey, Normandy School Board president, in a news release.

The Normandy School District lost accreditation in January 2013, and has since paid millions of dollars to other districts that accepted students seeking a transfer.
