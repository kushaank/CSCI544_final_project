When the first attempt didn’t take, Melissa hoped to try again in February. But she didn’t ovulate in February, and she began to wonder if she was showing the first signs of menopause. She decided that Llia should make the next attempt. Llia agreed on the condition that Melissa would also try again, since the chance that they would both become pregnant was about 4 percent.

“She kept saying, I’ve never done this before,” recalls Melissa.

“I can’t imagine being the mother of twins all by myself,” Llia adds.

“She (Dr. Slager) has been a huge advocate for us,” Melissa says.

With school vacation just a month away, Melissa is looking forward to being home with the boys for the whole summer. She says she felt a little guilty when she went back to work full time in January, leaving Llia to do all the diaper changing, nursing and rocking from 7 to 2:30. She also missed being there “live” for a few of the boys’ milestones, but thanks to the wonders of technology, she has been able to share the big moments before too much time has passed.

Melissa and Llia haven’t talked much about what they will tell their boys once they’re old enough to ask where they came from. Melissa, being a science teacher, will be able to explain the mechanics. But more than likely, they will focus on the lessons to be learned about life and the power of positive thinking.
