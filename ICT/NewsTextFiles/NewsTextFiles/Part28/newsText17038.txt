Women complained that the number of exclusive transport service for women ‘Tabeer’ is plying only on two routes i.e Route No. 1 and Route No. 7 but their is no facility for women travelling on other routes, adding, the number of women specific van on these two routes is also not sufficient to facilitate them.

Hina Ghani, an employee of a private firm at Blue Area said, it is hard to get a seat from 4.00 pm to 6.00 pm after leaving office due to rush at van stops and same is the situation in the morning.

She said, drivers are not willing to board women on vans except the two front seats reserve for them and these women left with no option than to wait for hours.

Hina further said, number of women specific vans is also quite limited and not plying on all the routes.

She opined that the problem would not solve until and unless the concerned authorities took the matter seriously and revise the women seats in all public transport.

Shumaila Ramzan, a student of a Foundation University said, she lives at Said Pur road Rawalpindi which is not far away from her university but she had to leave home at 6 am to attend the first lecture at the university at 8.30 am.

She said the two seats were reserved almost three decades back and no one bothered to again look into the matter or revise the seats despite daily complaints from women.

She appealed to the Commissioner Islamabad to take the issue seriously as a large number of women are travelling daily between the two cities and for job, studies and other house hold purposes.
