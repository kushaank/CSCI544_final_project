
Deputy Liberal leader Julie Bishop says  there's no place in Australia for the 'confronting' actions of  angry students who jostled and shoved her at a weekend protest.

A similar incident occurred on Monday when former Liberal MP  Sophie Mirabella was forced to leave Melbourne University under  police escort after being accosted by student protesters.

Ms Bishop said she would defend people's rights to express their  views and she understood some budget measures weren't popular, but  physical intimidation went beyond peaceful protest.

The minister had to be ushered by security from Sydney University  on Saturday after being mobbed and heckled by around 20 students  protesting proposed cuts to education in the federal budget.

'I have to tell you it was pretty confronting, having to be  taken past a group of people who were really in my face and pushing  and jostling and shoving,' she told Sky News on Monday.

'There's no place for that in Australian public life.'

Amateur footage taken at the scene showed Ms Bishop being  ushered through the scrum of students in scenes later described by  government frontbench MP Christopher Pyne as 'assault'.
