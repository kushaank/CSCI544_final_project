
A painting that appeared in the 1937 Carnegie International fetched $40,000 during Concept's May 9 and 10 sale. Resembling a modern-day Mona Lisa, the oil-on-wood portrait, titled âHead of a Sicilian Woman,â is signed by Polish artist Ludomir Slendzinski.

A mainstay on the local auction scene announces major changes, while other companies present a mix of online and live sales as the summer auction season approaches.

Dan Pletcher always seems to be on the move. Whether he's conducting sales at Constantine & Pletcher or handling the hammer at local auto auctions, the man never sits still for long.

Now, after 12 years at C&P's location in a former grocery store in Cheswick, Pletcher will shift the company's auctions a few blocks north to the Harmar House on Freeport Road, where bidders can participate in sales and enjoy beverages at a cash bar and catered meals prepared by the Harmar House crew. The C&P staff will set up shop nearby in a former doctor's office, where an on-site studio will be built for photographing items.

After months of planning, Pletcher says the move is just part of the plan for how C&P will do business from now on. Instead of holding uncataloged and cataloged sales every two weeks, the new format will offer just cataloged sales roughly every six weeks. Along with a streamlined schedule, each sale will bring to the block a more concentrated mix of high-end goods.

Behind the scenes, the company plans to improve its inventory, accounting and cataloging capabilities, along with a new look and more user-friendly options for its website. For Pletcher, the overall goal behind the transformation is to provide bidders and consignors with a streamlined, modern auction experience.

To introduce the ânewâ Constantine & Pletcher, which will retain that name, the company will conduct a series of âsoftâ launches, starting May 24, at the Harmar House. By eliminating the uncataloged sales that were long a staple of C&P auctions, all attention will focus on the main event. The first sale features a strong assortment of 425 lots of art, stoneware, jewelry and silver, Asian artifacts, art glass, ceramics, lighting, military paraphernalia and an ample choice of furniture â a category whose presence will lessen in coming months during C&P sales.

Highlights in this test run include an 18-karat yellow gold diamond ring with a center stone weighing in at 1.2 carats, American and European school paintings, Murano glass, World War II U.S. and German uniforms and gear, German bisque dolls and âsecretâ society pins.

Tripp Kline is having an Internet sale of what he describes as a collection of âcoolâ antiques and other items. The online-only sale, which ends May 27, shines a light onan artifact of the golden age of the âboob tubeâ with a selection of vintage TV lamps from the 1950s and '60s. Unlike a traditional lamp with a base and shade, these mostly ceramic lighting fixtures come in shapes of animals and humans that glow when turned on. Among the many forms are grazing deer, an exotic dancer, a gristmill, gold Scottie dog and three-masted ship.

With over 180 lots up for bid, the selections offer a potpourri of categories such as art pottery, 1950-'60s glass barware, Royal Doulton and Lladro figurines, majolica, 1950s wall clocks, an Apollo II space-capsule decanter and other curiosities and odds and ends.

Though bidding is only online, the goods may be previewed from 3 to 7 p.m. May 20 at the Three Rivers showroom on 382 W. Chestnut St., Washington, Pa. Details: 724-222-8020.

Almost from the moment BHD owner Brian Detch posted his May 24 to 29 online sale, one item struck a chord with many buyers: a mid-1930s National Duolian guitar. A favorite with bluesmen because sound resonated louder in the guitar's nickel-plated metal body, the National guitar enabled players to overcome crowd noise in the honky tonks where they entertained.

In generally good condition, the guitar shows a few signs of being well played over the years. As is the case with many of the gems in this sale, the guitar spent many years tucked away in an attic.

It's the same place Detch discovered a stash of 1960s-era Disney character PEZ dispensers made in Austria, still in their original cardboard boxes. He also uncovered a few toys in the attic, ranging from dime-store trinkets to a âjust like newâ vintage Louis Marx electric train with its original packaging.

A glass curved-front china cabinets highlights the downstairs goods, which consist of more recent vintage items such as furniture, china and other household pieces.

One of the bigger collections of crocks hits the market May 24, when Mark Ferry Auctioneers brings 120 churns, jars, jugs, banks and other stoneware vessels of various shapes and sizes to a sale at the Westmoreland Fairgrounds.

This one-owner grouping of hand-painted and stenciled stoneware dates back as far as the 1840s.

In most cases, the vessels bear the names of mostly Western Pennsylvania merchants that sold everything in them from salt and lard to meat and liquor. Built to endure many reuses and not always gentle handling, the jars tend to be in very good condition with little or no signs of damage.

Perhaps the best example of the crocks' sturdiness and artistry is a double-handled four-gallon piece decorated with hand-painted vines, flowers and snakes as well as a stenciled eagle.

Other goods in the sale include a collection of cast-iron âmatch safes,â which housewives would keep filled with matches above their stoves to light cooking fires. Also on the ticket are glassware, some furniture and other collectibles and antiques.
