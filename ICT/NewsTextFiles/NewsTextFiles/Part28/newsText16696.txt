
Climate change fundamentalists are predicting an apocalypse. Human depredation in the form of unbridled materialism is the cause. Any dissent from the fundamentalistsâ doomsday prophesies if their radical prescriptions to save humanity and Mother Earth are not followed is regarded as heresy.

Charge the well-funded climate change âdeniersâ with committing âcriminal negligenceâ for âtheir willful disregard for human life, âsays Lawrence Torcello, a philosophy professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology. After all, heretics must be punished.

Hansen co-authored with other like-minded scientists and economist Jeffrey Sachs, director of Columbiaâs Earth Institute and adviser to the United Nations, a scare-mongering paper entitled âAssessing âDangerous Climate Changeâ: Required Reduction of Carbon Emissions to Protect Young People, Future Generations and Nature.â  The paper, published in December 2013, predicted âmass extinctionsâ of species and demanded âurgent change to our energy and carbon pathway to avoid dangerous consequences for young people and other life on Earth.â The authors moralized that human-caused climate change is on par with the evil of slavery. It represented inter-generational injustice, they said, for which they recommended there be legal remedies.

The doom merchants aim to shove radical economy-wrecking prescriptions down our throats by parading before us their version of the plagues - draught, intense rain storms, floods, fires, pestilence, very warm temperatures and very cold temperatures, all of which they attribute to human-caused climate change. The idea that some natural events may be random occurrences in a universe that far transcends human activity is foreign to the climate change fundamentalists who believe that Mother Earth itself is anthropomorphic.

One problem that the climate change fundamentalists have in persuading the rest of us the sky is falling is that they keep changing their explanations.  For example, the catchphrase âglobal warmingâ was rebranded as âclimate changeâ when their computer models could not account for the fact that average atmospheric temperatures have risen little since 1998.

However, the climate change fundamentalists rationalize that looking at ten or fifteen year trend lines is a waste of time. âIf you are interested in global climate change, your main focus ought to be on timescales of 50 to 100 years,â said Susan Solomon, a climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. Nevertheless, the fundamentalists want it both ways.  Now they tell us that every unusual day-to-day weather phenomenon is a result of human-caused climate change.

Al Gore, one of the original climate change prophets of doom, predicted in 2008 that the entire North Polar Ice Cap would be completely ice free in five years.

Moreover, the hyperbolic rhetoric we hear from climate change fundamentalists does not correspond with what we observe around us ourselves, nor with some relevant empirical data.

Anecdotally, the most destructive river flood in the history of the United States, which began with extremely heavy rains in the central basin of the Mississippi in the summer of 1926, was the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. This occurred more than seventy-five years ago, well outside the most recent fifty year period in which human activity supposedly created the weather conditions of very heavy precipitation and floods cited by the Obama administrationâs National Climate Assessment as evidence of accelerating human-caused climate change here and now.  If the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 is not considered far enough back in time to put the Obama administrationâs Assessment findings in perspective, then consider the Johnstown Flood Of 1889. More than eight inches of rain fell in less than a one day period, resulting in a flood that took more than 2000 lives.

According to data compiled by NOAA indicating the percentage of the land area of the contiguous 48 states that experienced much greater than normal precipitation in any given year starting with 1895, the years 1910 and 2000 were nearly equal. There was no discernible accelerating upward trend line in the last fifty years. 1910 and 2010 had about the same percentage of the land area of the contiguous 48 states where a much greater than normal portion of total annual precipitation came from extreme single-day precipitation events.

None of this is to deny that human activity worldwide contributes to climate change via the cumulative impact of human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases. The questions to be debated are the extent and imminence of the problem, as well as the best measures to deal with the problem without wrecking our economy in the process. This is where the climate change fundamentalists become unglued. They do not want a policy debate. They want immediate action on their terms. Anyone questioning their dogma is blackballed.

Through their excommunication of serious-minded scientists who dare to raise questions and their increasingly strident and dogmatic proclamations, the climate change fundamentalists are turning into Cassandras whose prophesies are being tuned out by the public. Sadly, they drown out more reasonable voices who can contribute positively to the publicâs understanding of the multiple dimensions of climate change and sensible solutions.
