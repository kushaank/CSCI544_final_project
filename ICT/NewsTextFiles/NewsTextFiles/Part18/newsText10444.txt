
A man accused of more than 20 sex offences against young girls in the 1990s and early 2000s has gone on trial in the ACT Supreme Court.

Cameron Flynn Tully, 40, is alleged to have assaulted eight girls over a 12 year period, beginning when he was around 19 years old.

Tully was charged in 2011 when some of the victims went to the police.

Most of the girls were under 10, and one was only aged four at the time of the alleged offences which range from rape to acts of indecency, amounting to a total of 23 charges.

The jury has heard many of the incidents happened at Tully's parents' farm in Cook where the parents of some of the victims would go for church and other meetings.

Prosecutor John Lundy told the court it was not unusual for Tully and his siblings to supervise the children while their parents were at a meeting.

But Tully's lawyer Ray Livingston told the jury his client was barely ever at the farm during those periods because he was working.

He said Tully had very little to do with any of the girls at that time and rejected the accusations.

"The accused has denied ever having molested any of these young girls at any time," Mr Livingston said.

Tully is expected to take the stand in his defence later in the trial.

But the first day of the trial has been delayed, after technical problems meant the evidence from the first victim could not be taken.

Justice John Burns released the jury for the day.

It is hoped the trial will resume on Tuesday.
