
PARENTS, teachers, principals, unions and academics will be called on to help develop a plan to transform Queensland’s education system.

Premier Campbell Newman has told State Parliament of his plans to hold a meeting with key players in the education sector in September in a bid to draw up an education accord.

“The government is proposing an education accord, a formal partnership agreement between the Queensland Government and Queensland’s school education sector,” he told the House.

“To create the education accord, the government wants to work with its partners in school education to reflect on a shared vision so I am inviting those people who will have an essential role in shaping the education system — parents and students, principals and teachers, unions and academics from across the state to take part in this historic event on September 25.

“The education accord will guide the transformation of the schooling system and provide a vision for the future of Queensland’s kindergartens, schools and distance education centres through to 2044.

Mr Newman said invitations would be issued to representatives from key organisations across all education sectors, including early childhood, independent and catholic and higher education sectors, ahead of the September forum.
