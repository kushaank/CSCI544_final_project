The private companies who import raw sugar set their prices lower than the one fixed by state-own mills," he said.

He demanded increasing the import duty on raw sugar to save the state-owned sugar mills as livelihood of thousands of families including mill workers and sugarcane farmers is related with it.

Our Dinajpur Correspondent reports: Several thousand sugarcane growers from different upazilas of Joypurhat staged demonstration in front of the gate of Joypurhat Sugar Mills yesterday demanding their arrear payment of 2013-14 sugarcane crushing season.

Around 14,000 farmers cultivated sugarcane on 10,000 acres of land in the district with hope to get profit but most sugarcane suppliers are yet to get their payment, the growers said at a rally there.

"As the mill authorities are yet to disburse Tk 12 crore arrear dues, farmers regularly visit the mill to get their payment, but they return frustrated," Abu Taleb Chowdhury Babu, president of Joypurhat Akh Chashi Kalyan Samity, said at the rally.

Abdus Salam, managing director of Joypurhat Sugar Mills, said, "There is around 15,000 tonnes of unsold sugar worth Tk 60 crore at the mill. As soon as the stored sugar is sold, the sugarcane suppliers will be paid their dues. Otherwise, the mill has no fund to meet the growers' demand."
