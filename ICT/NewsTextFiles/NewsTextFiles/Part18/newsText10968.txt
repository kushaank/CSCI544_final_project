The activists were taken to the Partyzanski district police station and fingerprinted. The car of one of the activists was searched. All but Kurts were set free without charges.

The food-serving campaign was launched in Minsk in three places eight years ago. The police didn't show interest in the campaign until 2014. Since February, the police detain volunteers, take them to a police station, verify their identification and allow them to go free.
