
Former world number one Victoria Azarenka pulled out of the French Open on Monday as she struggles to recover from a foot injury.

"Unfortunately I will not be able to compete in Roland Garros this year," the two-time Australian Open champion, 24, wrote on her Twitter page.

"Working hard on my recovery and getting back on court," the world number five added.

The 24-year-old Belarus star, who normally would be a main rival to favourite Serena Williams, has not played since a second round loss to Lauren Davis at Indian Wells in the first week of March.
