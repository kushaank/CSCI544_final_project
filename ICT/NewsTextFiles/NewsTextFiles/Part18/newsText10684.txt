
(MENAFN - Kuwait News Agency (KUNA)) Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Sunday advised the West not to "waste" the opportunity to reach a final agreement on Tehran's nuclear program.

"Negotiations were tough, but an agreement is possible," Zarif said on his Twitter account, which was quoted by Iranian media, adding "agreement is possible. But illusions need to go. Opportunity shouldn't be missed again." On his part, Zarif's assistant Abbas Araqchi said "we seek a deal within six months, with a possibility of extension." The comments came after Tehran and the P51 group -- Britain, China, France, Russia, the US and Germany -- ended a fourth round of nuclear talks in Vienna on May 16 with no reported progress. Negotiations are due to resume in Vienna next month.

The six powers want Iran to limit nuclear work in exchange of lifting economic sanctions.
