
A second female Liberal member has been mobbed by angry protestors during a lecture at Melbourne University, just days after Sydney students allegedly "abused" Foreign Minister Julie Bishop.

Former Coalition MP Sophie Mirabella is the latest political figure targeted by the Socialist Alliance, believed to be the same group that picketed a number of cabinet members' appearances last week.

Video of today's incident shows Ms Mirabella struggling to move through a mob of students, voicing their anger at proposed employment and higher education changes - some yelling chants on loudspeakers.

Police officers can be seen pushing some protestors appearing to block Ms Mirabella's exit before ushering her away.

Melbourne University and Victoria Police confirmed Ms Mirabella was escorted off the premises shortly after 10am this morning.

"Approximately 20 protestors were demonstrating at one of the lecture theatres," a police spokesperson said.

A female guest speaker was escorted to her car by police, no one was injured or arrested."

Ms Mirabella was attending the university to give a guest lecture on politics and media.

According to Twitter, she returned to the lecture theatre 25 minutes later.

The incident comes just two days after Ms Bishop was "jostled" and "abused" during a visit to Sydney University.

Sydney University Student Representatives' Council officer Eleanor Morely said around 100 students gathered to protest measures announced in Tuesday's Budget, which could see universities set their own tuition fees for courses from January 2016.
