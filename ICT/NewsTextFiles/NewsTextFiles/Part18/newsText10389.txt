
Received a letter saying she was a 'talentless, fat a**** and unloved b****'

The first female editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, Amanda Wilson, has revealed she was subjected to sexist abuse during her tenure in the newspaper's top job.

Ms Wilson, who is the only female editor in the newspaper's 180-year history, wrote a comment piece for the Guardian a week after Jill Abramson, the first female editor of the the New York Times, was forced to step down from the role.

There has been speculation that Ms Abramson, who held the position for three years, was fired after learning that her male predecessor had been paid more than she was, and asking bosses for a pay rise.

In the comment piece, Ms Wilson wrote that during her time as editor she received treatment she does not think a male editor would have received, including being told by a corporate trainer to 'smile more' and being repeatedly branded as 'difficult' when she exercised strong leadership.

Ms Wilson also revealed that she received an anonymous letter, which she believes came from one of her employees, asking her who she slept with to get the job.

The letter described her as a 'shallow, talentless, fat a**** and unloved b**** with no leadership qualities' and declared it was 'No wonder your partner dumped you early on. He could see what a shallow, evil b**** you are.'

'The best thing you could do would be to resign before you trash that great paper further. If you continue, the hatred might build up to the point where someone might even punch you out in the lift,' the letter concluded.

Ms Wilson told MailOnline that she did not know if the sender of the letter was male or female and says she did not consider the letter as ‘sexism’ but as ‘abuse’.

She added that it was important, if difficult, for women to talk about their experiences of sexism in the workplace.

'I think a lot of women are reluctant to talk about any kind of sexism or gender bias, because they don’t want to be singled out as a whinging quote, unquote feminist because then they fear they might be overlooked for jobs or promotions, because they think they might be perceived as a problem,' she said.

Ms Wilson, who started at the Sydney Morning Herald in 1995 as foreign editor, stepped down from the editor-in-chief position in June 2012, after eighteen months at the helm, when she saw that 'none of her efforts were going to make a dent in the big picture of the Herald's future.'

Ms Wilson wrote that one of the reasons for the departures of women such as Jill Abramson from senior positions at media organisations is that women are often appointed as editors when news organisations are struggling, and publishers hope that women might bring about 'cultural transformation' and save the struggling paper.

'Until recently, no news outfit was rushing to load up the senior ranks with women. The big offer generally comes when senior management are grasping for solutions and want a change agent, so why not give the woman a go?' she wrote.

Because of this, Ms Wilson wrote that the work of female editors is 'akin to Ginger Rogers' famous line about doing everything Fred Astaire did but backwards and in heels.'

Ms Wilson concluded by writing that if the media is going to remain relevant it needs to strive toward gender equality, because female journalists 'understand how to tell stories about and for women, 'day in and day out… and not just around International Women's Day.'

Ms Wilson told MailOnline that writing such a revealing article 'was a very painful thing to do'.

'I really wasn’t planning on doing anything like this… It’s a very personal story,' she said.

However, Ms Wilson felt compelled to write something after reading about the firing of Jill Abramson from the New York Times last week.

'People do get sacked, that’s not a crime, but when I started to read that it was because of her manner and her style and the way she managed people, that’s very personal. It made my blood boil,' she said.

'I don’t want to sit here calling out examples of sexism... I wanted to share what I learnt as editor, about being a woman who is suddenly put into a leadership role,' she said.
