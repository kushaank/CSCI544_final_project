
Brigada ( Russian : Бригада), also known as Law of the Lawless, is a Russian 15-episode crime miniseries that debuted in 2002. It became very popular, but received mixed reviews due to accusations in aestheticization of violence . The miniseries follows the story of four best friends from 1989 to 2000, mainly concentrating on the leader of the group, Sasha Belov, played by Sergei Bezrukov . The fifteen part miniseries were written by Igor Porublyov and Aleksei Sidorov and were directed by Aleksei Sidorov .

The film proceeds in chronological order, apart from the scene at the beginning of the first episode before the opening credits, which was taken from Winter 1997 .

The film begins in 1989 when Sergeant Alexander (Sasha) Belov, (nicknamed Bely, or white) has finished his national service in the Soviet Border Troops , and returns to his home Bedroom District in Moscow . He is greeted there by his three childhood friends, Kosmos Kholmogorov (or Kosmos (Kos)/Space), Viktor Pchyolkin (Pchyola/Bee), and Valery Filatov (Fil/Phil). His return, however, shows that perestroika has deeply transformed the Soviet Union life and both Kosmos and Pchyola have turned to criminal racket on Moscow's markets. They try to lure Sasha to join them, but Belov abruptly refuses and instead has ambitions to attain higher education in vulcanology .
