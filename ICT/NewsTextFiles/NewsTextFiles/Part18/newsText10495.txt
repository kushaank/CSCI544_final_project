The figures tell the story. Last October's draft of Plan Melbourne - the blueprint for the city's future - forecast a population of 6.5 million by mid-century. The final plan now predicts 7.7 million.

Welcome to the reality of a Big Melbourne and a Big Victoria.

The Napthine government's answer,   a 205-page metropolitan planning strategy,   will attempt to set the direction for growth. It is the latest in a long line of plans to grapple with a growth, going back the best part of 90 years.

It has several things going for it. The big picture is the creation of a permanent urban growth boundary - at least until a future planning minister decides to change it. There is also the idea  to encourage growth in regional cities - a ''state of cities''.  At several levels, it tries to look to the future and plan for it.

But it is also a document of hindsight and, in some ways, an election document. The final plan now includes the big contentious transport projects  the government has announced in the lead-up to the election: the East West Link and the Melbourne Rail Link.

As such, it is also a highly political document that could be picked apart at the seams should the government lose power in November.

There was no invitation to the plan's launch for Roz Hansen,  who headed the committee that advised Planning Minister Matthew Guy.

This was always going to be the government's plan, but on Professor Hansen's account, Plan Melbourne may have been an opportunity lost for bigger thinking that might have survived a change in government.
