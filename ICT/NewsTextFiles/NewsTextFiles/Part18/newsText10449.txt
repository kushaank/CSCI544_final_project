
Rupert Murdoch personally supported Prime Minister Tony Abbott's campaign.

The marches are about more than just the budget, though. They are about the political vision the budget represents and the political leadership of Abbott.

Australian-born media mogul Rupert Murdoch is one such person with influence, money, and power. Murdoch personally supported Abbott's candidacy for prime minister and the Australian newspapers owned by his media conglomerate, News Corp, loudly supported Abbott, as well.

It's no surprise, then, that those same newspapers are less supportive of anti-Abbott protesters. What is surprising are the words splashed across the front page of this morning's Daily Telegraph (a News Corp paper).

What a fine way to engage in political dialogue about the future of Australia. "Ferals" is an interesting piece of Australian slang that can refer to hippies, punks, and environmentalists, but that's also used more generally to label people or things as disgusting or wild. And "are revolting" carries a bit of nasty double meaning as well.

Protesters have been quick to hit back against the characterization.

"The ferals are revolting" apparently equals normal folks of all ages and types walking around, carrying signs, being mad about budget priorities and politics, and very, very occasionally getting arrested.
