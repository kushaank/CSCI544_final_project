
Smartmatic, the world’s leading voting technology and services provider,        will make available a fully-verifiable electronic voting solution to        Bulgaria for the European Union Parliament elections to be held on May        25.

The National Electoral Commission of Bulgaria has contracted with        Smartmatic to implement the system. Citizens of Sofia and three other        Bulgarian cities will have the option to use it in the upcoming European        Elections. This event will advance Bulgaria's position within the        European Union as a leader in electoral modernisation.

To guarantee success, the London-headquartered company has custom built        a voting technology platform. It includes touchscreen voting machines        coordinated by powerful software applications, as well as a host of        services, including Smartmatic’s field-tested project        management methodology.

Bulgaria will benefit from having access to a fully-automated, unified        solution which includes vote casting, counting, transmission, tallying,        reports generation, and results publishing. Together with political        parties and electoral authorities, Smartmatic will conduct a        comprehensive series of audits at every stage of the process to validate        the correctness of results.

“We feel honored the Electoral Commission of Bulgaria chose us to        play a role in this new and innovative stage of modern elections in        Bulgaria. We look forward to a long and successful relationship – and        one that results in Bulgaria becoming a digital democracy pioneer, whose        example others within the European Union can follow,” said Alexander        Rakov, Smartmatic Sales Vice president.

Smartmatic is partnering with Bulgarian company, Ciela, forming the Consortium        for Electronic Voting DZZD, to successfully carry out all the        critical processes required for the project.
