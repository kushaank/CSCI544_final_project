
Brussels: Belgium will send an assistance mission to Bosnia-Herzegovina on the request of the authorities in Sarajevo, Belgian deputy Prime Minister Didier Reynders said Sunday, in the wake of recent floods.

Access to drinking water has turned a major problem there following last week’s floods in the region.

The government’s partners supported the decision in the board of Belgian First Aid and Support Team (B-FAST), Xinhua quoted Reynders, also chairman of the B-FAST coordination board, as saying.

Belgian public health ministry has plans to install a water purification unit, while the interior ministry will provide water pumps.

At least 19 people have been killed by floods in Bosnia-Herzegovina, with hundreds of buildings damaged and over 10,000 people evacuated, officials said Saturday. Heavy rain triggered floods, the worst in 120 years in the Balkan state.
