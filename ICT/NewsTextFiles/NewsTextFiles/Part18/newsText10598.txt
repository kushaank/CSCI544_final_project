
Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said he understands the nation's anger against the federal government's budget cuts.

State and territory leaders met in Sydney against the funding cuts to education and health, while protesters demonstrated in weekend protests.

Mr Shorten says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been put on notice to make the budget fairer, saying the Senate is the place to make it happen.

He's told reporters in Melbourne last Tuesday's budget is an unreasonable and unfair attack on pensioners, on the sick, on the needy and on the poor of our society.
