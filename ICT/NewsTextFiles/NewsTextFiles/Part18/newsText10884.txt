
CAMP OLIVAS, Pampanga, Philippines   – Police officers arrested two Bulgarian men for allegedly putting a skimming device in an automated teller machine (ATM) at a mall in Mexico, Pampanga.

Mladenov Emil Stoyanov, 22, and Karnev Lyuven Georgeiv, 28, were arrested after a bank client reported to the mall security guards that the ATM has two pin pads with a card skimmer, said Chief Superintendent Raul Petrasanta, Police Regional Office 3 director.

Petrasanta said before the arrest, the suspects were seen loitering and watching the ATM booth.

The two were held by mall security guards until police officers arrived.

Investigators reportedly found in the suspects’ possession three data cables that matched the ATM card skimmer, a screwdriver and a laptop computer with decoding software.
