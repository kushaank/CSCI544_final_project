“Business events and their legacies help to further NSW’s expertise and growth and we are excited by the redevelopment of Sydney’s Darling Harbour precinct and the new ICC Sydney as these facilities will be key to continuing growth, fostering collaboration and furthering our global connections to fuel productivity,” BESydney chief executive officer Lyn Lewis-Smith said.

A total of eleven events have now been secured for ICC Sydney, due to open in late 2016, attracting industry leaders from nine of the NSW Government’s priority sectors, including professional services, information and communication technologies, international education and research and medicine.

Moreover, BESydney recently won the International Council of Commercial Arbitration Congress, a joint bid by Australia and New Zealand for its 2018 Congress to be held in Sydney, with an add-on event in Queenstown, New Zealand.

The attention to detail and high level of service offered, have made this Emirates flight experience excellent all round.
