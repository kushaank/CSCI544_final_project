
Four Harvey Norman franchisees have been fined thousands of dollars for misleading customers about their warranty rights.

The Federal Court has ordered the Gordon franchisee in New South Wales, as well as the franchisees in Mandurah and Albany in Western Australia, to pay a total of $60,000.

A fourth franchisee in Oxley, Queensland has been ordered to pay $26,000.

The false or misleading representations were made orally by sales representatives or store managers in each of the stores.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) says the stores have also been ordered to display signs correcting the misleading information.

ACCC deputy chairman Michael Schaper the penalties are a warning to all suppliers.

"A number of different Harvey Norman franchisees across the country had led consumers into believing that contrary to the law, they weren't entitled to a refund, a replacement or a remedy for damaged goods," he said.

"[They led consumers to believe] the firm had no obligation to provide any remedy to fix up items that were still covered under warranty and it had no obligation to provide refunds for items.

"These judgments imposing penalties are a clear message to all suppliers, no matter how big or small, that they must not mislead consumers about their rights under the Australian Consumer Law."

A total of nine Harvey Norman franchisees have been fined for misleading customers since proceedings brought by the ACCC began in 2012, with a total of $234,000 in penalties.
