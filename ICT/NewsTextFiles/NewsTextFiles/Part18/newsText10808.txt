
Mechel said that further sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine crisis could affect indebted Russian miner Mechel's US coal business Bluestone.

The situation in Ukraine since Russia' annexation of Crimea has developed into the worst standoff between Russia and the West since the Cold War, prompting Washington and Brussels to impose sanctions on some Russian individuals and companies.

Western governments have so far refrained from imposing sanctions on leading companies, but they have threatened further measures that could target key sectors such as energy and banking if the crisis escalates.

Mechel said that the company could face sanctions affecting its Bluestone coal assets in the United States and that it "cannot assure that such developments (further sanctions) will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects".

The company said that the sanctions already imposed could have the indirect effect of damaging the Russian economy, further accelerating capital flight from Russia and negative investor sentiment towards the country, making it harder for Russian companies to access international financial markets.

The coalminer and steelmaker, controlled by businessman Igor Zyuzin, has been hit by weak prices for its products, forcing it to sell loss-making assets and to negotiate delayed debt repayment with creditors.

Mechel has been looking to sell Bluestone since the H1 of 2013 to lower its USD 8.6 billion of net debt. It had temporarily halted mining at the company in late April because of weak coal prices.
