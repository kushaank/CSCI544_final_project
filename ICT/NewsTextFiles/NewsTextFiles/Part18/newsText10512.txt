
Palmer told the media club he supported deregulation for overseas students, who currently pay full fees while the average Australian student is subsidised for more than half of their degree by the government.

Palmer has also called for the end of the Help scheme (formerly Hecs) which most students use to pay for their degrees, and instead make university free.

“We should be doing everything we can to encourage our smartest Australians to pursue tertiary education and take this great country forward, rather than put barriers in their way such as higher fees and Hecs,’’ he said in a statement.

Palmer said Australia’s best thinkers were being “stifled” and the country was “burying them in debt”.

The government will need Palmer United party support to pass legislation which is opposed by Labor and the Greens when the new Senate sits in July. Palmer has already come out in opposition to the $7 co-payment to visit the GP, the indexation of the pension and increase in the age of eligibility, the indexation of the fuel excise and the deficit levy for higher-income earners.
