
Melbourne's unseasonably warm weather looks set to continue after 10 consecutive days of temperatures up to six degrees above average.

The temperature reached 21.3 degrees Celsius just after 11am (AEST), equalling the record for consecutive May days above 20C set back in 1972.

Richard Carlyon from the Bureau of Meteorology said the warm weather has been caused by a slow-moving, high pressure system over the Tasman Sea.

"Normally we see cold fronts move through every two or three days, giving us fluctuating temperatures," he said.

"This high has been very strong over the last week-and-a-half and has blocked these cold fronts from moving through.

"We've had high temperatures not just in Victoria but in New South Wales and South Australia."

Forecasters are predicting a top temperature of 22C on Thursday.

"It looks as though mild conditions [are] continuing for quite some time, not just in Melbourne but across Victoria," Mr Carlyon said.

"The warm nights we've been having will continue as well.

"We could stretch it out to 12 days. There's no sign of any real cold air to give us average or below average temperatures in the forecast right out to next Monday."

The official start of winter is just two weeks away.
