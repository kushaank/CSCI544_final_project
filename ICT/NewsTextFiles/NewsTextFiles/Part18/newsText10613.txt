
Miranda Kerr has made some rare comments on her faith and spiritual life.

The Australian supermodel told a reporter in New York that she did not subscribe to the Buddhist beliefs of ex-husband Orlando Bloom but was in fact a Christian.

She added, however, that she would describe herself as being more spiritual than religious and that meditating helps her deal with challenges.

"I'm not Buddhist. I'm Christian. I pray every day. I meditate every day and I do yoga. I'm not religious, I'm spiritual," she told The Telegraph Â while promoting her new collection of tea china for Royal Albert.

Her latest comments clarify the long-running belief that Kerr was in fact a Buddhist who practised the religion alongside her former husband Bloom.

In the interview, the former Victoria's Secret model spoke fondly of her childhood and drinking tea with her grandmother.

"And praying is something my grandmother taught me as well. To pray and be grateful, have gratitude, is a big thing for me," she said.

Kerr and Bloom, who have a son together, announced their separation last October after three years of marriage.

There have been other big changes in Kerr's life too recently, after it was announced in April last year that she would no longer be a Victoria's Secret angel.

Instead, she is focussing on other modelling contracts and her own organic skincare line, KORA.

Asked about the support network she has in her adopted home of New York City, Kerr said: "When I have challenges now, I feel like I sit with them, I try to look at things, because there's always a positive and a negative to everything.

"And sometimes I'll speak to friends, and sometimes I'll just meditate and I'll visualise letting it go, or whatever it might be. Meditation and yoga, and having people, as I said, who you trust, who you talk to. But also writing. I like to write, and then I can rip it up or burn it."
