
The company joins more than 160 mostly-European companies who have signed the legally-binding five-year agreement. The move also piles further pressure on Swiss supermarket retailers Migros and Coop to join the pact.

Jyrki Raina, general secretary at global union IndustriALL, said it is "shameful" that both companies, which source textile products from Bangladesh, have yet to become signatories.

UNI general secretary Philip Jennings added: "The Bangladesh Accord was made in Switzerland and Swiss companies should be amongst those leading the charge to save lives."

To date, more than 500 factories have been inspected. By October this year, the Accord aims to have inspected all 1,500 factories used to supply clothing to its signatories.

According to a progress report to mark the Accord's first anniversary, production has been suspended in 12 factories supplying the group of brands and retailers in Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia.
