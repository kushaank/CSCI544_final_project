
Australia's depression research facility Black Dog Institute and scientific research organization CSIRO has developed a web tool to look into millions of tweets in real-time to create a global map of emotions. The tool has been named as WeFeel. The organization is of the belief that the tool will help in obtaining crucial information in order to predict how social, economic and environmental factors impact our emotions.

Black Dog Institute executive director Professor Helen Christensen said that the power of this information must not be trivialized. Christensen said that over five years old population data is currently used by mental health researchers and associated public health programs.

"Should the real-time data gained using this incredible tool prove accurate, we will have the unique opportunity to monitor the emotional state of people across different geographical areas and ultimately predict when and where potentially life-saving services are required", added Christensen.

Around 27 million tweets will be scanned by the tool everyday and with the use of around 600 specific key words, the team will be able to ascertain six key emotions, including love, joy, surprise, anger, sadness and fear.

Amazon Web Services' Kinesis will be used to process big data in real time and displays the emotions in a streamgraph. Also, the data can be sorted out according to region, date and emotion. Professor Christensen also said that this information may also be very useful for developing ways to early intervene in emergency cases, like someone who has developed suicidal tendencies. The tool can bring a revolution in social media by providing much needed help to many people.

The tool is not a perfect one as it is not able to precisely differentiate between sarcasm and sincerity. But, scientists are working to figure out the difference between what people feel and what they choose to share.
