
Etihad Airways has further increased its stake in Virgin Australia, according to a statement on the Australian Securities Exchange.

The announcement said that the voting power of Abu Dhabi-based Etihad has increased to 21.24 percent from 19.9 percent.

Etihad, which originally owned nine percent, has been buying up Virgin shares on the ASX and more than doubled its stake in October last year.

Virgin Australia is owned by Etihad, Air New Zealand and Singapore Airlines and all three shareholders are expected to have board representation from July.

In January, Etihad's chief executive James Hogan confirmed he will personally take up a seat on the board of Virgin Australia.

Hogan, an Australian, is the first boss of three airlines offered a board seat to reveal he would personally take up the position.

Virgin offered Etihad and its other significant shareholders, Air New Zealand and Singapore Airlines, a board seat each after they injected $350m into the Australian carrier as part of a capital raising exercise late last year.

Etihad and Virgin Australia fly 28 times a week from Australia to Abu Dhabi, which will increase to 35 flights in July when Etihad launches a daily Perth service.
