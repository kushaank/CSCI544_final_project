
Dermatologists have issues warning to all Australians against a pimple which looks harmless but is the reason behind hundreds of deaths every year. Delayed diagnosis in cancer patients leads to six times the risk of death.

This cancerous pimple looking nodule is red in colour and is nothing like a dark mole which misleads even skin specialists to believe that it's a harmless form of skin cancer or even just a pimple.

Associate Professor John Kelly, a speaker at the annual scientific meeting of the Australasian College of Dermatologists in Melbourne, however says that this may look like a regular pimple but is extremely deadly and should be removed in a matter of three months.

Just 15 percent cases of melanoma are caused by this red looking nodule but 43 percent melanoma deaths are a result of this little pimple like eruption.
