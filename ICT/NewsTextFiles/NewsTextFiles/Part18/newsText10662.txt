
A teenager accused of exposing himself to a 13-year-old girl in Canberra's north has been charged with seven new offences.

The boy allegedly exposed himself and then tried to grab the girl while she was walking her dog in Evatt last month.

Police allege the boy has now been linked with further incidents and he faces seven more charges of trespass, burglary, and multiple acts of indecency.

He has indicated he will plead not guilty to most of the charges.

The boy did not apply for bail today.

But his lawyer told the ACT Children's Court, a bail application is likely in the next few weeks after police asked for extra time to gather evidence.

The court heard the case will depend on DNA evidence.

The teenager is due back in court in early July.
