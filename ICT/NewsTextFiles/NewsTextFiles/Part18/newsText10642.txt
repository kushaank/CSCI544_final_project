
Former Victorian Premier John Brumby is urging state and territory leaders to make a 'courageous' push for a hike in the GST.

Debate over the goods and service tax has been trigged by  federal cuts to state health and education funding, with the Abbott  government accused of blackmailing premiers and chief ministers  into lobbying for a change.

Mr Brumby, who chairs the soon-to-be-abolished COAG Reform  Council, said GST reform was inevitable and 'looks more and more  like the best option that we've got'.

'The real debate is about the nature of the increase,' he said  in a speech at Melbourne University on Monday night.

'Is it base? Is it rate? Is it both?'

Compensation for low income earners and pensioners also needed  to be considered, he said.

Mr Brumby told Sky News increased state responsilibites combined with $80 billion in proposed cuts to federal funding for health and education produced 'a fiscal outlook for the states that is completely untenable and unsustainable.'

Mr Brumby admitted that lobbying for a GST hike would be a  'courageous' and 'difficult' decision for premiers to make.

'If I was a state premier I think I'd be putting up my hand to  say I'll have the GST, thank you very much',' he said.
