
A wonder drug that saved businessman Ron Walker's life will soon be available to Australian patients with advanced melanoma.

Pharmaceutical company Merck Sharp and Dohme has given Australian patients with stage three and four melanoma access to the drug, known as MK-3475, on a compassionate basis, following a campaign by doctors, support groups and cancer survivor Ron Walker.

Mr Walker had his life-saving PD-1 treatment in the United States as part of a clinical trial in early 2013.

He says MK-3475, which has a 50 per cent success rate, gave him a second chance at life.

"It worked a miracle," he told 7News health reporter Karen O'Sullivan. "In fact the professor said to me: 'Do I believe in miracles?' and I said: 'yes I do'.

"I'm a living example of a drug that actually works because the cancer is gone."

It is welcome news for some of Australia's sickest melanoma patients.

Melissa Sheldon has been battling melanoma for five years, and has become one of the first Australians to receive access to the promising drug under the new special access program.

"There's hope," said Ms Sheldon. "There's hope for patients in my situation. There's so many others out there, so it's fantastic news."

The drug belongs to a new class of cancer treatments where the body uses its own immune system to reject the cancer.

Prof Grant McArthur, of the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, said: "I would not use the term 'miracle drug' to describe any cancer drug, but it certainly is one of the biggest steps forward I've seen in my career."

The treatment will be given to a handful of extreme cases each month.

While there is still limited access to the drug, Prof. McArthur said it could make a difference to the 1400 patients who die from advanced melanoma every year in Australia.
