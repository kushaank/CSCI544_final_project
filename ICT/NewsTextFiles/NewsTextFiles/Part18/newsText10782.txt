
BRUSSELS, May 19. /ITAR-TASS/. Vandals have poured white paint over the monument to Peter the Great in the Royal Park in Brussels, Russian Embassy in Belgium told ITAR-TASS on Monday.

The plinth had been covered in graffiti, some chaotic abbreviations with no political motivation, the embassy said.

A letter has been sent to the Belgium's Foreign Ministry. The Russian Ambassador to Belgium has also requested the mayor of Brussels to promptly put the bust in order.

This was not the first time the monument was vandalized, and the place in general was overtly neglected despite its proximity to the Royal Palace, the ambassador added.

A group of Russians intends to request the mayor to move the monument presented to Brussels by the Russian industrialist Anatoly Demidov in 1856 to a more appropriate spot.
