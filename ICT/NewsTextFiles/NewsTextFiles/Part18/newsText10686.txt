
Austrian border guards were not quite sure where to start listing the reasons to take this transport off the road after discovering a car missing some wheels and carrying two huge diesel filled canisters on top of a two wheeled trailer - and 10 panicked sheep in the car pulling it.

The sheep, car and diesel had been gathered in Germany by Romanian Florin Sarbu, 46, who reckoned he would make a killing on selling the battered car, short haired sheep and diesel once he got it back to Romania.

And although he managed to successfully cross from Germany into Austria, his journey ended when he got to the Nickelsdorf border crossing from Austria into Hungary.

Officers who went to check that the defect estate car was secure discovered it filled with diesel, and the distressed sheep in the car at the front.

Border guard spokesperson Marcus Ehrenhauser said: "The sheep were in a rough shape, they didn't have access to food and water and had already been in the car for five hours when they were stopped at the Austro-Hungarian border. Initially the officers didn't notice them because they were lying down but then they heard them calling. They were handed over to the local veterinary station where a decision will be made about what should happen with them. The car driver was charged and then allowed to continue on his way â€“ without the car on the trailer, or the diesel, or the sheep."
