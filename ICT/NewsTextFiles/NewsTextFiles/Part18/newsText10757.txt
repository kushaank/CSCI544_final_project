
President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev is paying a working visit to Vietnam   from May 18-20 at the invitation of President Truong Tan Sang, which aims to embrace bilateral economic ties.

Establishing diplomatic ties in 1992,  Vietnam  and  Azerbaijan  have enjoyed good political relations on the foundation of the traditional friendship built in the time of the  Soviet Union. The exchange of high-level delegations was resumed in 2010 with a visit by Deputy Prime Minister Hoang Trung Hai.

Last year, Vice Chairman of National Assembly Uong Chu Luu and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Nguyen Phuong Nga also visited   Azerbaijan.

The same year,  Azerbaijan  opened its embassy in   Vietnam.

Both countries have also closely coordinated at the United Nations and international forums.

In 2010, the two countries signed an agreement on   visa exemption for diplomatic passport holders   and a protocol on cooperation between the two foreign ministries.

Their two-way trade reached 325 million USD in 2013, a tenfold increase from the previous year, with   Vietnam   exporting mainly mobile phones, computers, electronics and seafood while importing crude oil and petrol from the market.
