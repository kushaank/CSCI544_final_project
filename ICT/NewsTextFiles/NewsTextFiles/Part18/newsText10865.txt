
ISLAMABAD: The opposition senators, mainly from the PPP, expressed fears on Monday that a 1977-like situation was being created in an attempt to wrap up democracy.

The PPPâ€™s parliamentary leader, Raza Rabbani, warned that the federation would cease to exist in its present shape if attempts to change the democratic set-up succeeded.

The senators also questioned the governmentâ€™s â€œinaction and silenceâ€� over the prevailing situation in the wake of the ongoing fighting between media groups and launching of a movement by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) against the alleged rigging in last yearâ€™s general elections.

â€œThis time, the federation, and not the constitution, is at stake,â€� warned Mr Rabbani while initiating a debate on the political situation.

Without naming the PTI, Mr Rabbani said that in a systematic way and as a first step, elections were being questioned and as a result the entire parliament was being made â€œredundantâ€�.

He said all institutions functioning under the constitution, be it the Election Commission or the judiciary, were being made controversial.

The PPP senator said elections were made controversial in a similar fashion in 1977 and a movement was launched by the then opposition alliance (Pakistan National Alliance) which was later given a religious turn.

â€œToday again, we are facing almost the same situation,â€� he said, reminding the upper house of the imposition of martial law by Gen Ziaul Haq after violent protests by the opposition following the 1977 elections.

â€œWill the federation continue to maintain its geographical boundaries,â€� he asked.

Mr Rabbani said that on the one hand insurgency was going on in Balochistan and, on the other, â€œreligious extremism and sectarianismâ€� were breeding in Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Mr Rabbani said time had come to recognise that Pakistan was a â€œmulti-ethnic state with diversityâ€�. The efforts made to create a â€œforced unityâ€� had not succeeded in the past and would not succeed in future, he added.

PPPâ€™s Saeed Ghani criticised the government for what he called becoming a silent spectator. He termed it a â€œcriminal silenceâ€�.

â€œDid you (the government) investigate who is behind these banned outfits holding rallies and public meetings in support of an institution,â€� he asked.

Mr Ghani also criticised the PTI for expressing no-confidence in the Election Commission and the judiciary. He recalled that when the Supreme Court disqualified former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani through what he called an â€œunconstitutional and illegal verdictâ€�, Imran Khan backed the judiciary, but was now agitating against it only for not taking up his petitions.

MEDIA WAR: About the ongoing controversy following the airing of an objectionable programme on a TV channelâ€™s morning show and registration of cases against it, Mr Ghani said the government had left the matter to be decided by â€˜maulvisâ€™. â€œThey always exploit religious sentiments,â€� he alleged.

Referring to the war of words between the media groups, PPPâ€™s Farhatullah Babar said democracy and parliament would face threats if media became weak. He suggested that a house committee be formed to recommend steps to resolve the controversy, which arose after an armed attack on senior journalist Hamid Mir last month.

He called for learning a lesson from the 1971 East Pakistan tragedy.

Leader of Opposition Chaudhry Aitzaz Ahsan said the PPP would not support a ban on any media group. He criticised the government for not coming into action and putting the lives of employees of the Geo group in danger.

The Senate will continue debate on the motion on Tuesday evening.

They should be ashamed of their performance in their last stint and the current performance in Sindh province. The massive corruption, bad governance, and poor law and order in the country has resulted in loss of faith in democracy in eyes of common people. If they had governed well, people would have had faith in democracy. Though, PML-N is performing relatively better, yet people don't see any benefit in terms of their economic conditions.

I agree , Mr. Rabbani is a person who always oversee , keeping view what happened in 1977 , presently , the present Prime Minister is so strong than establishment. All the nation believe democracy is the best option of public service and it is in the best public interest that democracy should prevail. Media Hoses are fighting for what they brought in our society ,they started new trend to create environment where politicians must fight with each other it is what we saw in past years , Our Media seems limitless , After the arrival of Nawaz Sharif in Parliament , Talibans are fighting internally , Media Houses are also fighting with each other , in my humble opinion , I think Nawaz Sharf is looking blessed cleaning stains of the society.

Indirectly all parties are striving to destabilize present govt for their stupidity. Present drama in the country is staged by agencies and everybody witnessed who is in front, all those blue eyed of agencies are staging the protest and political parties very politely supporting them but remember once this system collapse no one from present slot of politician will get benefit even Imran Khan, he will also be used. Present govt is doing well but they are goof don't know how to handle such situation.... Now time is to stop this otherwise people in disguise of civil society, protesters openly calling military to take over .... if anybody don't understand it is his fault.

@Missing Link . I do agree with you that PML-N is performing better than previous government in all respects. But unfortunately PML-N always come in majority and subjected to down fall  within months what to talk about 5 years, just because they do not respect law from their inner hearts but talk of laws, misuse power of demo-crazy and found of taking personal vendetta.

I don't see any wrong the Presidential System. It can better reflect the mandate of the Pakistani nation. These parties are threatened by change hence calling it threat to the Federation.

Who will be hanged this time. There is no Bhutto around involved in these dirty games. There are  three culprits. The person who became PM thru tained ballots, The person who favors talks with taliban and the one who points fingers towards uniform. Army dont like these three guys.

The PPP is raising the questions now asking what the govt did to contain sectarianism and terrorism when they themselves did not do anything much in their 5 years tenure. They had a whole 5 years at their disposal with a friendly opposition of PML. They had ample time to contain this terrorism.

Better be slave to the army than to be ruled by bunch of illiterates who has done nothing but damaged Pakistani Economy in the past 10 years. PPP should focus on delivering their promises rather than standing next to a channel known for its foreign agenda. The whole corrupt lot on one side and Imran Khan on the other. I will take my chance by standing next to our Patriotic leader Imran Khan.

If democracy is derailed now, the champions of democracy will be responsible for it. These so called champions left no stone unturned to destabilize the same. All parties have played their role especially the one who remained at the helms of the affairs of this country. So please stop shedding crocodile tears. You still have time to undo the damage you have caused to the democracy and the country due to your misuse of power and massive corruption.

As always the elected politicians are creating a situation that will probably lead to a single door exit. It is better to behave good now than pulling your hair later. Peoples that voted you to power are getting desperate at your failure, deliver what you promised in your election campaign.

Mr. Raza Rabbani is raising doubts about wrapping up of ongoing Democtratic process; but at the same time he should stress his party to deliver honestly for at next 4 years. His government in Sind province could not stop land mafia, water mafia, kidnapping mafia. In fact if these are not eliminated u can expect the people will ask the military to take care of them; so please rule the province seriously. More or less same situation are in other provinces also.

Mr.Rabbani, would not you like to refer to Election 1970, the resultant winning party, break-up of East Pakistan to become Bangladesh, "Tum Wahan, Hum Yahan", "Tang Taud Do Gha" Etc.Etc.

It is not Politics for Pakistan, it is the Politics for Power that the Political, Religious and Ethnic Parties are fighting for. In the ultimate analysis it would be, "Na rahey Baans, Na bajey Bansuri". So, keep on trying for means to an end.

I agree with this viewpoint but there is a difference. In 1977 the situation was created over a course of many months which appeared as natural to many. However, this time the heroes have become zero within a short span of 30 days. This really shows the power of the kingmakers and have exposed the future agenda as well. Any wise man shouldn't live in the fool's paradise and should prepare his mind for a massive change in the coming months.
