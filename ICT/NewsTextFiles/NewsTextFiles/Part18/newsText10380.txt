“Melbourne based home builder Mahercorp has appointed Huckleberry Agency to manage the media and digital planning and buying for their residential business, Eight Homes.

Eight Homes is responsible for building distinctive, award winning houses, and offering house and land packages across Melbourne’s suburbs. They offer a collection of sixteen architectural homes that range from single storey, three bedroom homes to two story five bedroom homes in a range of contemporary designs.

Huckleberry presented their media strategy and suite of tools to Eight Homes, who were impressed by the agency’s integrated approach and understanding of the target audience.

The campaign has so far included a sponsorship of the Chrissy & Jane breakfast program on Mix101.1 in Melbourne, including activations and promotions with their street team. An integrated television campaign is currently being planned.

This may take some time.
