Called "Let's be Merciful!", the campaign is aimed at raising money for the families of the disaster victims, AzerTag news agency reported.

"We share the grief of the families and the loved ones of those who tragically died in a mine disaster in Turkey," Azerbaijan Red Crescent Society said in a statement.

The Society had already carried out similar campaigns to help people suffering from quakes in Van, Turkey, and Eastern Azerbaijan, Iran, and poverty in Somalia in the past.

The mine accident in the Soma city of Turkey's Manisa province left 301 people dead and 486 more injured.

Some 25 people have been arrested on charges of criminal negligence in the mine accident.

In total, there are 740 coal mines and 48,706 miners in Turkey.

Over 3,000 people have been killed and over 100,000 injured in mining accidents in Turkey since 1941. Some 10.4 percent of the total number of the work accidents occurs at mines in the country.
