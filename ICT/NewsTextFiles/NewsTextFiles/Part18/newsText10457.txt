
Brisbane Convention & Exhibition Centre (BCEC) was named Australia’s best venue at the Meetings & Events Australia (MEA) Conference in Kuala Lumpur on the weekend.

Operated by leading venue management group AEG Ogden, BCEC won Australia’s major venue award – Meeting Venue 500 Delegates or More – from a highly competitive field of entries in recognition of an outstanding performance in the period under review.

BCEC General Manager, Bob O’Keeffe said being judged Australia’s best was yet another highlight in a year that will culminate in the Centre hosting the world’s most significant business event, the G20 Leaders Summit in November.

“This latest recognition highlights the world class facilities and services of the Brisbane Convention & Exhibition Centre, key reasons why Brisbane was chosen to host the G20,” said Mr O’Keeffe.

“The MEA awards acknowledge excellence, best practice and professionalism in a highly competitive business events industry, qualities which will come under the spotlight when Brisbane and the Centre become the focus of world attention in November,” he said.

Mr O’Keeffe paid tribute to the Centre’s “passionate and professional team” who are responsible for the Centre’s award winning event delivery every day.

The attention to detail and high level of service offered, have made this Emirates flight experience excellent all round.
