TAREE'S UGL Rail Facility could be resurrected after the State Government announced plans to buy $2.8 billion worth of new trains.

According to ABC News, the 65 new trains are perfectly suited for Taree's UGL, with the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union (AMWU) secretary describing it as a great opportunity.

"This is exactly the sort of project that would deliver hundreds of jobs for regional NSW, and I firmly believe the UGL facility in Taree would be a beneficiary of this project," AMWU secretary, Tim Ayres told the ABC.

UGL's Taree plant closed last October.

"We haven't lost hope, what the government said is they want 'off the shelf' trains, we have the capacity to deliver off the shelf trains in NSW."

UGL closed the Taree plant in October last year after months of dismissals and forced redundancies, due to a loss of contracts, and has been on care and maintenance since.

More than 130 employees were affected.
