
A TAIWANESE delegation of investors has had the opportunity to experience what the Gladstone region has to offer.

The party of 46 invited by Lyons were at the company's master-planned community The Sands last Wednesday before they caught the ferry to Heron Island for two days.

It is hoped the visitors will be able to sell the merits of Australia on their return home.

Senior development manager at Lyons Capital Oliver Kent said the investors were eager to see the project their money was going into.

"They really love Gladstone as a region," he said.

Mr Kent said the large lots allow ample space for sheds, boat storage in addition to a dream home.

The Sands is looking at practical completion at the end of the month, titles out in July and the first stage of houses expected to be completed in December.
