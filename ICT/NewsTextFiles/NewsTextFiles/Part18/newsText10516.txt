
SUVA, Fiji: A man appeared in a Fiji court Monday charged with manslaughter over the death of an Australian tourist in a boat collision off the South Pacific nation last week.

Jimi Beti, 33, faces charges of manslaughter, criminal recklessness and negligence over the death of 40-year-old Mark Hardaker of New South Wales state last Thursday.

Hardaker was returning from a fishing trip when a speedboat driven by Beti, a Fijian, allegedly crashed into his vessel, causing fatal head injuries.

The court was told Beti was operating the boat without a licence. He was refused bail and remanded to appear in Lautoka High Court on June 4.
