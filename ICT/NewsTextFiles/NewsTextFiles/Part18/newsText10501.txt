
YOUNG Leeton resident Jayden Collins was officially labelled as a "survivor" at an Australia's Biggest Morning Tea event last week.

JAYDEN Collins receives a survivor sash from Cancer Council community program co-ordinator western NSW Mathew McKenzie at an Australia's Biggest Morning Tea street stall last Friday.

"It's nice to be able to have some good news for Jayden and to give this sash to him."

Organiser Meryl Parker has also suffered from cancer and she too has been told byÂ doctors she is now in remission.

"Everyone is always so generous with us because most people know someone who has been affected by cancer."

This year the Cancer Council hoped to recruit 35,000 generous morning tea hosts to support its work with prevention programs, research and support services for all people affected by the disease.
