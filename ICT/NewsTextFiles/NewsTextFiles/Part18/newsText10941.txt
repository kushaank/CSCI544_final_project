
Next time you're in the Bahamas, be safe and hire a pigeon carrier or something: according to a new report from Glenn Greenwald's The Intercept , the NSA is secretly recording and storing every single cell phone call made on the islands.

The Intercept has confirmed that as of 2013 , the NSA was actively using MYSTIC to gather cell-phone metadata in five countries, and was intercepting voice data in two of them. Documents show that the NSA has been generating intelligence reports from MYSTIC surveillance in the Bahamas, Mexico, Kenya, the Philippines, and one other country, which The Intercept is not naming in response to specific, credible concerns that doing so could lead to increased violence. The more expansive full-take recording capability has been deployed in both the Bahamas and the unnamed country.

The Bahamas and the country that The Intercept is choosing not to name are part of an American government program called SOMALGET, which is a subset of MYSTIC reserved for the two countries (that we know of) that are having entire phone calls stored for up to 30 days. Bahamian cell phone traffic was breached without the country's knowledge by the NSA in conjunction with the DEA.

It's also unknown whether SOMALGET is technically illegalâ€”the DEA seems to be involved because it has an arrangement with the Bahamas that would provide cover for the NSA's surveillanceâ€”but, nonetheless, the American government is once again proving to be highly efficient at making unnecessary enemies simply for acting like dicks.
