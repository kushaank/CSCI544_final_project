
DRIVERS who kill or injure people in serious crashes will have to have mandatory blood tests in Victoria.

Under current laws, only injured drivers have their blood tested for drugs and alcohol after serious crashes.

Police Minister Kim Wells said new laws would be drawn up to make sure uninjured drivers were also required to give blood.

"I'll be talking to the Attorney-General Rob Clark and Minister for Transport Terry Mulder this afternoon to get the wheels in motion to be able to make a change," Mr Wells told Fairfax Radio on Tuesday.

"It just didn't seem to make sense to me that an injured driver was treated different to an uninjured driver."

Victoria Police Chief commissioner Ken Lay had earlier called for the law to be changed to close the loophole.

"People that end up with catastrophic injuries, their lives change forever; I think there'd be a case to say those matters also should be pursued where full blood tests should be done," Mr Lay said.

Mr Wells said laws were already in place in NSW that allowed police to demand a blood test after a serious crash.

"We're going to start following that up and look at the way they do it and try and model what we have here on what they have in NSW," he said.
