
ROLF Harris forced his tongue into the mouth of a terrified school girl, a court heard today.

The 11-year-old felt "repulsed" when the veteran entertainer, 84, told her he "wanted to be the first to give her a tongue kiss", jurors heard.

The woman, now in her 50s, said how she felt "scared" during the incident at a mutual friend's home in Darwin, northern Australia, in 1969.

The woman told Southwark Crown Court that she was off sick from school and came downstairs in her pyjamas when she saw Harris.

It is claimed Harris walked up to the victim, put his tongue in her mouth, slid his hands up both sides of her body and gave her a "tongue kiss".

She said: "It seemed like it lasted forever but it must have been very quick."

She continued: "I was quite repulsed by it. Absolutely repulsed."

The alleged victim said the incident went on to affect her future relationships, leaving her feeling "frazzled" and on the verge of a "panic attack" when her three previous husbands tried to kiss her.

"I told them it's because it's a leftover from when I was a child and this happened to me," she added.

The woman is not one of the alleged victims Harris has been charged with indecently assaulting but gave her evidence as a supporting prosecution witness.

Harris is accused of 12 counts of indecent assault on four separate women from 1968 to 1986.

He denies the charges.
