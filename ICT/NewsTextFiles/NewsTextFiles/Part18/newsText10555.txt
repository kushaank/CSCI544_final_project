AN Albury man on an intensive corrections order over a kidnapping offence has been charged with a series of drug matters.

Josh Beau Sweeney, 25, of Southern View Drive, appeared in custody in Albury Local Court yesterday facing eight charges.

He made no application for bail and the charges were adjourned until June 30.

It is alleged he had possession of a variety of drugs when arrested at Lavington about 2.20am Sunday.

Sweeney faces two counts of supplying methamphetamine.

He is also charged with supplying cannabis leaf, two counts of possessing methamphetamine, possessing cannabis leaf, possessing cannabis resin and possessing LSD.

Sweeney received an intensive corrections order when sentenced in the District Court at Sydney earlier this year over a kidnapping matter.

Judge Martin Blackmore had agreed in December to have Sweeney assessed for the order after being told he had a long-time drug habit.

“This sort of order is very strict. If you breach it ... You go straight to jail,” Judge Blackmore had told Sweeney on December 5.
