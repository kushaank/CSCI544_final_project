
THE budget put an unfair portion of its cost-cutting burden on Tasmania, according to shadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh.

Shadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh, visiting North-West Tasmania today, said the federal government should shelter the state from measures to bring Australia to surplus.

This would save between $10bn and $20bn over four years, he said.

Dr Leigh will visit Caterpillar and youth services in the North-West today.

It would boost productivity by improving confidence in the business sector and among investors, he said.
