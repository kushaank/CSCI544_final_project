
PRIME Minister Tony Abbott fails to understand the immediate impact of his government's federal budget cuts, the Victorian government says.

Victorian Premier Denis Napthine wants a meeting with Mr Abbott to resolve what he says is a misunderstanding about how more than $200 million in federal cuts will affect Victoria's budget.

"Our advice from our senior officials is that there'll be immediate impact in terms of health ... a reduction in concession payments and there'll potentially be immediate impacts in terms of education funding over the first four years of the Better Schools plan," Dr Napthine told reporters on Monday.

However, Mr Abbott has said the federal budget decisions won't impact on the states until post-2017.

He says the cuts won't come for three years so the Commonwealth and states have time to develop a new funding model.

But Dr Napthine says the decisions will affect Victoria in six weeks.

"Clearly, he doesn't understand the immediate impact as of the 1st of July on the Victorian budget and on services in health, on concessions and potentially education."

He said a round table discussion was the only way to resolve the dispute.

Dr Napthine also said there will be no changes to concession payments to Victorians, despite a federal government cut to concession payments by $75 million in the upcoming financial year.

At a meeting in Sydney on Sunday, state and territory leaders rejected the cuts as completely unacceptable and said hundreds of hospital beds would have to be closed across the country.

But Mr Abbott rebuffed a demand from premiers and chief ministers for an emergency meeting with him before the end of July, saying he speaks regularly to state and territory leaders.

State Opposition Leader Daniel Andrews accused the premier of mock outrage.

"I don't know that someone who's presided over the longest waiting list in Victoria's history has a lot of credibility on health cuts," he told Fairfax Radio.
