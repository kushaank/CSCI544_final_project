
Australians in Thailand should steer clear of protests and "exercise a high degree of caution" following the declaration of martial law, the federal government says.

"You should pay close attention to your personal security at all times and monitor the media for information about possible new safety or security risks," the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in its latest advice for the Southeast Asian nation popular with Australian tourists.

"You should follow the instructions of local authorities and avoid any protests, protest sites and political events."

The army says it has imposed martial law to restore order following months of violent anti-government protests.

It follows the dismissal earlier this month of prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra, in a controversial court ruling that sent tensions soaring.
