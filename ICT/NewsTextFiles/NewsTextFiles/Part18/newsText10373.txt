
A researcher from the Sydney University is hoping a new study will end speculation about a possible link between autism and vaccines.

The issue is still a topic of debate in areas such as Mullumbimby, where childhood vaccination rates still hover at around 50 per cent.

Associate Professor Guy Eslick says he reviewed available data from around the world, involving one-and-a-quarter million children.

He says there was no evidence proving a link between autism and vaccines, or their components.

"We've reviewed every study that's been conducted that had controls as well as cases, and these studies were followed up for on average nine years to assess individuals in the studies to see if they'd determined autism or autism-spectrum disorder," Prof Eslick said.

"These are sort of important factors that we feel make this hopefully one of the definitive studies.

"Just because you're looking something up on the internet, doesn't mean you should be taking it as gospel, that's for sure.

"Of course you can always take information you've got off the internet to your GP and ask questions.

"I think it's important to question things.

"I mean as a parent with three kids of my own I think you'd be silly not to question any procedure that your child's undergoing, no matter how small.

"But it's important to make sure that you've got the right information, that you're well informed."
