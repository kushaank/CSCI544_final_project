
CYBERJAYA: Measat Global Bhd expects to see a 37.4% increase in revenue to US$136 million (RM437.9 million) from US$99 million, bolstered by its soon to be launched new satellite worth US$350 million.

Measat-3b is scheduled to be launched on May 29 in French Guiana and has a lifespan of 15 years.

Measat Satellite System Sdn Bhd chief executive officer Paul Brown-Kenyon said even before the launch, the company has already leased out 50% of the new satellite’s capacity.

“For Measat 3b, we have already signed two long-term contracts ranging from 10 years to 15 years,” he told a media briefing yesterday.

The contracts were signed with Astro’s Measat Broadcast Network System Bhd and Australia’s NewSat.

Measat-3b is the company’s largest satellite and expands Measat’s direct-to-home broadcasting and telecommunications satellite capacity in Malaysia, India, Indonesia, and Australia. With the addition of Measat-3b to its fleet, Measat will have a total of six satellites in orbit.

Measat-3b has 48 transponders each providing 36 megahertz of bandwidth, bringing the company’s Ku-band satellite capacity to 84 transponders from 36 currently.

Brown-Kenyon expects Measat-3b’s capacity to be fully leased out by year-end.

“By end-2015 or early 2016, we will launch another satellite, Measat-3c. This brings our 2017 revenue forecast to US$260 million,” he added.

He noted that Measat-3b and the upcoming Measat-3c satellites will co-locate with the existing Measat-3 and Measat-3a satellites at the company’s orbital hotslot at 91.5 degrees east.

“This will create Asia’s most robust and reliable satellite orbital location,” he said.

Today, the company operates capacity across five satellites with a network reaching 150 countries, representing 80% of the world’s population. The satellites offer services ranging from telecommunications and broadcasting to broadband.

Brown-Kenyon said the company will continue to launch one satellite every one or two years.

“Besides Measat-3c, we are already planning three new satellites, namely Measat-2a, Measat-3d and Africasat-1b,” he added.
