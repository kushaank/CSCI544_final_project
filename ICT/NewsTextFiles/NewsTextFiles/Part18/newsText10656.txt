
The State Government has allocated $50,000 to help support programs to protect one of Queensland's most endangered animals.

The money will be used to fund activities to support to the long-term conservation of bilbies.

Queensland Environment Minister Andrew Powell says the State Government is committed to working with organisations like the Save the Bilby Fund, to safeguard the future of the threatened species.

The fund was first started 15 years ago in Charleville.

The fund's co-founder, Frank Manthey, has also announced his retirement from the foundation and will finish next month with a bilby show in Charleville.
