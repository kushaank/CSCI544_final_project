
A US court has found the radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri guilty of supporting terrorism.

The Egyptian preacher, whose fiery sermons before and after September 11 attracted extremists to his London mosque, was accused of conspiring to aid organisations like Al Qaeda and helping the kidnappers of 16 tourists in Yemen in 1998 including Sydneysider Andrew Thirsk, who was killed in the attack.

Al-Masri was also accused of trying to build a terrorist training camp in the US state of Oregon.

The 56-year-old had denied the charges but now faces a possible life sentence.
