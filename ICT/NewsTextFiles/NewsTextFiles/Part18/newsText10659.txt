
WELL that’s awkward.

British chef and Masterchef Australia judge Marco Pierre White’s Steakhouse Bar & Grill has been given a zero rating for food hygiene by the Food Standards Authority.

Known for his firey temper and high expectations from contestants on the popular Channel 10 cooking show, the rating will no doubt be a shock for Pierre White, which sees his 2011 establishment join 140 other restaurants in the area which have been zero-rated by the FSA.

The restaurant, located on the 25th floor of new establishment The Cube in Birmingham, was given the lowest grade possible due to “either poor standards of hygiene, structure, confidence in management — or a combination of these factors,” reports the Birmingham Mail.

“Marco Pierre White was informed their FSA rating would drop and it has been published on the FSA website,” a Birmingham City Council spokeswoman said.

A spokesman from the restaurant has confirmed “that we received a visit from the Environmental Health Department of Birmingham City Council earlier this year. The feedback was provided in an informal manner by the EHO with some recommendations.

The man himself is yet to comment on the zero food rating.
