
Striking fuel-tanker drivers will head back to the picket lines after failing to reach a settlement with Toll Carriers.

First Union members went on strike at the beginning of the month after more than three months of bargaining with the Australian company for a collective pay agreement.

The union says the company has refused to match industry rates, which are up to $10 an hour more than what the drivers are currently paid.

The latest discussions between the parties on Friday afternoon bore no fruit, with the industrial action now continuing.

First Union said the drivers and their supporters were organising five pickets at BP stations in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.

"We are genuinely surprised by the lack of co-operation here," First Union organiser Jared Abbott said.

"The company's stance appears to be driven by pride rather than costs."

Toll was already struggling to retain its staff, with almost 30 drivers leaving BP's Northland contract in six years, Abbott said.

"BP and Toll must have been aware of the problem before now and have done nothing about it," he said.

"BP has got to take more responsibility for what goes on in their supply chain."

The first picket is scheduled for tomorrow at the Waterview BP Connect store in Auckland.

Toll and BP did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
