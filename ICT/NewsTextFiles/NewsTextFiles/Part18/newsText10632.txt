
A Brisbane mother will face court next month on charges of       supporting terrorism after being arrested while trying to       leave Australia with her four young children.

The 29-year-old woman was charged as a result of a       counter-terrorism operation that focuses on foreign       incursions, an Australian Federal Police spokesman told AAP.

Detectives from the NSW joint counter-terrorism team stopped       the woman at Sydney airport on May 3 as she tried to board an       international flight with her children.

The woman is believed to be the wife of Mohamed Elomar, who       is reportedly fighting in Syria.

She was living in Brisbane at the time of her arrest but her       husband is believed to be from Sydney.

She's due to appear before Sydney's Downing Centre Local       Court on June 2.

Mohamed Elomar's uncle, also named Mohamed, was jailed for       plotting to blow up a Sydney army base and his brother Ahmed       is due to be sentenced for his role in the 2012 Hyde Park       riot.
