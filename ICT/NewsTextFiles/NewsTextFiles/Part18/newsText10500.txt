
The Duchess of Cornwall left behind a wealth of good feelings in north-end Dartmouth after an intimate event there during Monday’s royal visit.

The province’s protocol office didn’t want the whole visit to be spent in Halifax, said Community Services Minister Joanne Bernard, who represents Dartmouth North in the legislature.

The duchess did the rest, said Bernard.

“She was very specific about who she wanted to talk to, and women leaving violence was top of the list,” said Bernard.

At about 12:40 p.m., Camilla arrived at the tiny Northbrook Community Centre on Chapman Street, near the intersection of Victoria Road and Symonds Street.

More than 100 people were waiting, some wearing tartan and carrying streamers.

She has asked for similar meetings during visits to other countries.

She also met Alice Housing’s staff, board and corporate sponsors, including Atlantic Lottery Corp., Labatt and Turbine Fashion, and encouraged the sponsors to keep up their support, said Bernard.

Afterwards, Camilla visited a children’s fair that had been set up in the gym because of a forecast for rain. She laughed and politely declined to have her face painted but spoke to many in the crowd.

John Watters Jr.’s six-month-old daughter caught the duchess’s attention, and he told her she was named Elizabeth.

“She said, ‘That’s a pretty name for a beautiful little girl,’” said Watters Jr., 24.

Outside, Camilla spent half an hour doing an unplanned walkabout and speaking to more than 50 people who lined up to meet her.

Twins Shanlisscia and Nastiasscia Thompson, 29, said they couldn’t wait to upload their photos and video to Facebook. It meant a lot that the duchess visited the heart of the neighbourhood, they said.

“It’s close. It’s convenient,” said Nastiasscia.
