
PETALING JAYA : Data from the missing MH370 flight will be provided to the public soon.

Acting Transport Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin said that he has instructed the Malaysian Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) to discuss with Inmarsat on the release of the aforementioned data for public consumption, in light of the MH370's next of kin's recent demand for the Inmarsat “raw data”.

"This is consistent with our stand for greater transparency and prioritizing the interests of the family members of those on board MH370," he said this in a press statement.

Hishammuddin added that as the team entered into the tenth week of search operations, the authorities have now started moving into a new phase, which involves deep-sea search requiring specialised expertise and assets.

"As deliberated in the Tripartite meeting in Canberra, a team of hydrographic experts from Malaysia, China and Australia, met over the weekend and agreed that an extensive bathymetric survey of the areas provided by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau will be carried out in the Southern Indian Ocean," he said.

He pointed out that the survey will be conducted by the Chinese navy vessel, Zhu Kezhen (872), which is scheduled to sail for the survey area on Wednesday if weather permits.

"On a similar note, a team of technical experts had convened in Canberra to discuss and refine the satellite data, calculations and analysis which have been made available by Inmarsat," he said.
