
The ECOWAS Commission on Monday strongly condemned Saturday’s violent incidents that led to many deaths in Kidal, Mali.

A statement issued by the Commission’s Spokesperson, Mr Sunny Ugoh, said in Abuja that the incidents followed clashes between Malian armed forces and rebels opposed to the visit of Malian Prime Minister, Moussa Mara.

The statement said that the rapid deterioration of political and security situation had resulted in several casualties on Saturday and Sunday nights.

It also stated that the President of the Commission, Mr John Mahama, had reiterated ECOWAS commitment to the June 18, 2013 Ouagadougou Preliminary Agreement.

It noted that this included elections and inclusive peace talks, in particular the core principles relating to the territorial integrity, sovereignty, and secular character of the State of Mali.

It also stated that the ECOWAS President had called on all parties to exercise maximum restraint and to seek mutually acceptable sustainable solutions to the crisis through peaceful means.

To this end, Mahama called on all stakeholders in Mali to return to the guidelines of the Ouagadougou Agreement, the release stated.
