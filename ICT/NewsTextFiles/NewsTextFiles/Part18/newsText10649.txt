
ABOUT 116 school students at Ratu Meli Memorial School can now enjoy water, sanitation and hygiene facilities thanks to the Australian Government, Education Ministry, Live and Learn Environmental Education and UNICEF Pacific.

Included in the $72,000 project were renovations to school buildings and classrooms and boarding dormitory including sanitation facilities there as well.

The aid was part of a $3million investment by the Australian Government as part of its WASH program to improve sanitation facilities in 15 disadvantaged schools in the country.

"It is very encouraging to know that the 116 girls and boys at Ratu Meli Memorial School will have access to clean water, proper child friendly sanitation and hygiene facilities while pursuing their studies in school," Australian High Commission first secretary Pamela Larkin said at the handover event last Friday.
