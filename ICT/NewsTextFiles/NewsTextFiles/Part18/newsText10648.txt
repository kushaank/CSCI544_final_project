
JOHANNESBURG – A man has been arrested for allegedly assaulting a pupil at the Stanwest Combined School in Standerton, Mpumalanga.

A video of Thursday’s attack was leaked to the Standerton Advertiser, despite reports the school allegedly told students to delete any footage or pictures of the incident.

The video shows a man, who appears to be a worker at the school, attacking a male pupil with a broom.

The boy is hit over the head and knocked to the ground before being hit several more times before the broom breaks.

The video has since been shared on social networking sites.

The man was arrested on assault charges on Friday and appeared in court on the same day.

The matter was postponed to Tuesday.

It’s still unclear what led to the incident and the Department of Basic Education in Mpumalanga says it’s investigating the incident.
