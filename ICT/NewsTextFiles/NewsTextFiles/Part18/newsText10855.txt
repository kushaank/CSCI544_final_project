
The relatives of a boy, who died some time after being taken to Hizla Upazila Health Complex in Barisal yesterday, beat up a doctor accusing him of delaying to begin treatment.

Isharul Shikdar Dhruba, 13, son of Dulal Shikdar from Guabaria, was brought to the hospital with high fever around 9:15am and admitted immediately, said Hizla police.

The attendants were asked to collect medicines from the hospital store or outside.

But the condition of the child deteriorated within a few minutes; he vomited and then died before his treatment could be started, said Subhangkar, upazila health and family planning officer.

Following the death, the boy's elder brother Yunus Shikdar and cousin Alamin Mridha attacked the doctor. Subhangkar denied the accusation, saying the boy collapsed and died due to extreme temperature.

He sued the attackers.
