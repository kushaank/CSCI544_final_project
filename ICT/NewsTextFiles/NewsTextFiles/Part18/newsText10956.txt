
NASSAU, Bahamas - A court in the Bahamas has rejected an effort by environmental activists to halt dredging off Bimini that is part of a resort development for the cluster of islands near Florida.

The Court of Appeal declined in a 2-1 decision Monday to grant the injunction sought by the Bimini Blue Coalition. The coalition argued Resorts World Bimini lacks proper permits for dredging that the group says is harming underwater habitat.

Resorts World Bimini is dredging off North Bimini to build a terminal for its Miami-based cruise ship. The unit of Malaysia-based Genting Group has opened a casino on Bimini and is building a hotel.

The company says it has the required permits and is minimizing environmental damage. Spokeswoman Heather Krasnow says the pier is scheduled to be finished in July.
