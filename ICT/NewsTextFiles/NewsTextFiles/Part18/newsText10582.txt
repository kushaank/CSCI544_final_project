
An Australian woman hit a young girl on 7 May in Port Moresby but kept on driving to the bank’s offices before reporting the incident.

“Clearly this was a terrible situation and our staff member’s wife reacted in exactly the way she was taught by PNG security experts,” the bank said in a statement to SBS.

“All companies operating in PNG instruct their staff and dependents not to stop when involved in road accidents due to the significant risk of violence and to report the matter as soon as practical to police.

A spokeswoman for Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs told SBS said they were aware of the incident but had no involvement in the repatriation.

Australian Federal Police stationed in PNG were pictured assisting the child in photos on front page news reports by the country’s Post Courier newspaper.

The girl’s family has been offered assistance by the bank.

The ANZ says their employee and his wife are “available at any time to provide any further assistance to PNG police”.
