A PROPOSAL to excise  74,000 hectares of forest  from World Heritage listing  was hampered by a hostile  former Tasmanian Labor- Green government, according  to Liberal senator  Richard Colbeck.

His comments came after  the International Union for  the Conservation of Nature  on Saturday advised the  World Heritage Committee  to reject the government's  bid to delist the area.

The former state government  would not release data  needed to support the federal  Coalition's proposal for  delisting, Senator Colbeck  said.

Data showing previous  logging activity within  parts of the 74,000 hectares  would strengthen the federal  government's argument  that sections of the  area were degraded, he  said.

However the IUCN advised  the WHC that 85 per  cent of the area proposed to  be excised was natural forest  and 45 per cent was old  growth, and dismissed the  government's proposal.

"The new proposal would  impact negatively on the  outstanding universal value  of the property," it said.

Senator Colbeck said the  government would continue  to propose the changes and  take its case to each of the  21 member nations of the  World Heritage Committee.

Meanwhile, Environment  Tasmania has called on the  federal government to drop  its proposal.
