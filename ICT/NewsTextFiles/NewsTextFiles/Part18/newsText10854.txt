
A court here on Sunday sent eight teachers of Shaheed M Mansur Ali College to jail, rejecting their bail prayers in a case filed for attacking the principal of the college.

The accused are Md Abdus Samad Khan, Md Ajgar Ali, Farhad Hossain, Golam Main Uddin Khan, Ashraf Ali, Md Manjil Alam, KM Motiur Rahman and Md Nazrul Islam.

On April 20, a gang swooped on principal Md Abdul Mannan, 52, and stabbed him when he was going to a court in the district town.

Immediate after the incident, police arrested one of the teachers of the college Md Jalal Uddin and Md Tufan, a local criminal, in connection with the attack.

The victim then filed a case with Sadar police station, accusing 16 people, including the eight teachers.

On Sunday afternoon, Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Abu Saleh Md Salauddin passed the order after they were produced before the court.

In November last year, Principal Mannan was suspended on charge of misappropriating Tk 7.51 lakh from the college fund, said sources.

“When the principal came under the attack the teachers were on duty in the examination hall”, said Md Rafiqul Islam, a teacher of the college.

The students of the college formed a human chain on the campus yesterday, protesting filing of the 'false' against the teachers.

They the teachers had earlier filed a complaint with Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) against the principal. Angered by this, he lodged a 'false' case against them, they added.

They also threatened to launch a tougher agitation programme if the teachers were not released immediately.
