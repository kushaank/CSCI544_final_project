
Azerbaijan's Emergency Situations Ministry has sent humanitarian aid to Serbia for flood relief operations. Two planes with humanitarian aid were sent to Serbia on May 19.

The assistance was rendered upon Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev's instructions, ministry's official Amal Teymurov told media on May 19.

Teymurov said another plane with humanitarian aid will be sent to Bosnia and Herzegovina this evening. Dozens of people were killed and thousands were left without houses as a result of the floods in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The death toll in Serbia from the worst flooding seen in 1,000 years has risen to 17.

Serbia declared a state of emergency on May 15, after record rainfall triggered floods that killed at least five people in one day. More than 24,000 have been evacuated and some 7,000 homes left without electricity, Predrag Maric, the head of the Serbian Interior Ministry's emergencies unit, has recently said.

Russia, the European Union, the U.S., Turkey and Belarus have sent helicopters, planes, rescue units and life-saving equipment. The government has also mobilized psychologists to assist people at shelters.
