Hours before the Ritz-Carlton, Rancho Mirage, beckoned guests to rediscover one of Southern California’s most scenic havens, VIPs and hospitality leaders tipped champagne-colored flute glasses to toast the milestone opening.

Now completely renovated, its $500 million metamorphosis under a new set of developers complete, the facility once� held up to ridicule as a costly albatross that would never reopen held a grand opening� Thursday, May 15. It is the first Ritz-Carlton property to open in the United States since 2010.

The 244-room property, which includes 16 suites, is positioned on a 650-foot-bluff overlooking greater Palm Springs. Besides its commanding view, the resort offers a two-story luxury spa, three restaurants and swimming pools, 23 fire pits and classic ambiance.

Uncluttered, it is minimalistic décor with a splash of class.

Herve Humler, president and chief operations officer of Ritz-Carlton, told about 140 dignitaries gathered for the ribbon-cutting event and reception in the State Fare Bar & Kitchen that Rancho Mirage has long been a great supporter of the brand.

Rancho Mirage Mayor Iris Smotrich said she is confident Ritz-Carlton will create breathtaking memories of a special paradise for residents and the valley’s guests.

Sidestepping past the many financing hurdles developers faced to get to this point, along with the incentive that the city created to ensure the Ritz-Carlton flag remained, Smotrich commended New Age Rancho Mirage and Kam Sang Co. for taking the project to the finish line.

When The Ritz-Carlton opened the original property in Rancho Mirage decades ago, it was the seventh hotel. Today, there are 86 Ritz-Carltons around the globe.

Ted Weill, a council member, said the property’s opening is great for Rancho Mirage and tourism. It is also inextricably linked to Sunnylands at the Annenberg Retreat.

Geoffrey Cowan, president of The Annenberg Foundation Trust at Sunnylands, the ceremonial first guest, sees a wonderful symbiotic partnership between the properties.

When Chinese President Xi Jinping traveled to Rancho Mirage to attend a Sunnylands summit in May, he stayed at the Hyatt Regency Grand Champions Resort & Spa in Indian Wells, Cowan said.

“That kind of thing will happen here,” Cowan said, noting the probably that Ritz rooms will be booked when royalty, diplomats and other high-caliber guests from around the globe attend Sunnylands Rising Oceans summit with Prince Albert II of Monaco in the fall.
