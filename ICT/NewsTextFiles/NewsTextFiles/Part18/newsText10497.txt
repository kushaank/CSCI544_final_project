UNPLANNED pregnancies among teens and young women can pose many problems but a free program  is helping to ease some of the stresses of early motherhood.

UNPLANNED pregnancies among teens and young women can pose many problems but a free program is helping to ease some of the stresses of early motherhood.

Bump is aimed at those aged 13 to 23.

Samantha Fulton, 22, of Brighton-Le-Sands, has used the mentoring service for six months.

"My mother died three months before my baby was born," she said.

"The pregnancy was unplanned and I felt so alone when my mother died. It's the time you think of your mother the most. You want her to tell you that you are doing a good job."

Her mentor, former school teacher and mother-of-three Christina Scala, 62, is like "a big sister".

"She knows what you have been through and she gives you the chance to talk more personally about the past. I can open up to her," Ms Fulton said.

Bump includes weekly mentoring and monthly workshops. The young mothers receive a TAFE certificate after a year.

Ms Scala said the program helped her give something back to the community.

"I listen and chat and hope I give sensible advice. There's respect on both sides," she said.

"I want Samantha to achieve her goals. It is actually inspiring."

The inaugural program in Sydney in 2009 had 13 graduates. Last year the 101 graduates came from the metropolitan area, Wyong on the central coast and Melbourne's north.

Mentors undergo 16 hours of accredited training at the TAFE NSW Northern Sydney Institute and working with children checks.

Mums can refer themselves or be invited by community members. The program in this area is run in the Bay City Care building, Arncliffe.
