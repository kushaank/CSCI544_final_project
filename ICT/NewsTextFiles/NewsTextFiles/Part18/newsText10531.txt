California Gully resident who left industry due to dodgy dog breeders welcomes ALP announcement.

CHANGES: Adrian Finlayson Smith with puppies.

A FORMER dog breeder forced from the industry says he welcomes a proposed crackdown on puppy farms.

The state Labor Party announced new measures to support animal welfare at the weekend.

If Labor is elected, the RSPCA will be given an extra $5 million to fight puppy farms, female dogs will be restricted to having five litters, and pet shops will only be able to sell dogs supplied by a registered breeder, shelter or facility.

California Gully resident Adrian Finlayson Smith, who had bred Staffordshire bull terriers for about five years, said he had left the industry due to "dodgy" breeders.

“It’s something I don’t want to be associated with,” he said.

“I left mainly due to the people doing the wrong thing.

Mr Finlayson Smith said it was a case of “the few ruining it for the many”, but said the proposed changes could force the issue further underground.

“It’s something that’s a bit hard to manage,” he said.

More than 100 dogs were rescued from wire cages at a Pyramid Hill puppy farm last August.

Member for Bendigo West Maree Edwards said the government had walked away from a proposed crackdown on puppy farms.

“If a person is breeding dogs, they should be constantly in touch with their vet to ensure animals are looked after,” she said.

“What we know is there are rogue breeders out there who are breeding puppies in extraordinarily horrid conditions.
