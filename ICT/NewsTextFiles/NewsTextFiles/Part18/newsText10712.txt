This is quite surprising. I think that the existing generation in Azerbaijan must know Russian to communicate with neighboring countries, and English to communicate with our farther neighbors. Both languages bear much importance throughout the world. The Russian language will never fall short of significance. This language is especially important in terms of cultural integration”.
