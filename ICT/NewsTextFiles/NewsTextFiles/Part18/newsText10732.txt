
Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev started his official visit to Vietnam on May 18.

A guard of honor was arranged for President Aliyev at Noi Bai International Airport in Hanoi.

The Azerbaijani president and his spouse Mehriban Aliyeva were met by senior state and government officials of Vietnam.

Then a brief protocol talk took place.

Azerbaijani-Vietnam cooperation is fast developing. Azerbaijan opened its embassy in Vietnam last December, while the Azerbaijan-Vietnam inter-parliamentary friendship group was established in Hanoi in November 2013. The group includes six members of Vietnam's National Assembly.

In October 2013, Vietnam simplified the visa regime for Azerbaijani citizens, making it possible for Azerbaijani citizens to obtain a visa upon arrival at Vietnam's airports. According to the new rules, Azerbaijani citizens only need to provide the relevant documents given by the Vietnamese travel agencies regarding their trip in order to get a visa.
