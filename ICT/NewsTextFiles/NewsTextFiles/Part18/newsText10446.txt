
It is still unclear when many Canberrans will have access to the National Broadband Network (NBN).

NBN Co changed its rollout maps after the Coalition Government was elected last year.

The Federal Opposition says up to 110,000 ACT homes and businesses do not know if they are still going to be connected.

NBN Co's chief operating officer Greg Adcock fronted a Senate Committee in Canberra and told committee chair, Labor Senator Kate Lundy the old maps were not realistic.

"The people that you refer to of the ACT are in the same boat as many, many people who had expectations set on information that was aspirational to say the least," he said.

Mr Adcock says new rollout plans for the region are currently being formulated.

"The basic position is that it would be improper for me to speculate what technology, high speed broadband would be delivered to Canberrans at this point in time,"  he said.

Senator Lundy says the evidence provided by NBN Co has revealed very little about the status of the service rollout.

"There are a still a lot of questions that that need to be answered," she said.

"I am disappointed that NBN Co could not provide more information for Canberrans."

"What we have learnt however is that the rollout of the NBN in Canberra has slowed to a snail's pace under the Coalition."
