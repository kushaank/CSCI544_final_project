
Tehran, May 19 (TruthDive): Mohammad Javad Zarif, foreign minister of Iran says settling an absolute nuclear deal with world powers is still “possible” in spite of a tough round of talks this week.

Zarif said the final nuclear deal is within reach still. The latest and the fourth round of nuclear talks between Iran and six world powers – Britain, China, France, Russia, the US and Germany – in Vienna last week ended with little progress.

Zarif said on Twitter, “Agreement is possible. But illusions need to go. Opportunity shouldn’t be missed again”.

The talks in Vienna were ruined on Friday with informal statements from both sides.

An unnamed Western representative told huge gaps remain between two sides. More realism is needed on the other side and they had expected a little more flexibility.

The West blames Iran of trying to construct a nuclear weapon. Britain, China, the United States, Germany, France and Russia – known as the P5+1 group want Tehran to thoroughly scale back its nuclear undertakings permanently to make sure that assembling a nuclear weapon could be impossible.

Iran says all its nuclear energy activities are for peaceful purposes entirely such as medicine and power generation. Israel and the West suspect it is a shield for obtaining the capability to make nuclear weapons. On July 20, an interim agreement under which Iran had curbed uranium enrichment in return for the lifting of some Western sanctions is due to expire.

Abbas Araghchi, senior Iranian nuclear negotiator, was reported as saying by the IRNA official state news agency that the next round of nuclear talks between Iran and six world powers will take place in Vienna from June 16-20.

In one another development, an Iranian media reported that an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) delegation would visit Tehran on Monday to discuss Iran’s nuclear work.

Tehran is pursuing to lift of all Western and UN sanctions, which are crippling its economy.
