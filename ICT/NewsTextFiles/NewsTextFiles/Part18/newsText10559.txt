
In the face of sporadic terrorist attacks, hundreds of tourists have cancelled their trips to Kenya and scores have hurriedly left the country. The US, UK, France and Australia issued travel advisories against visiting Kenya, especially the coastal city of Mombasa.

The Kenya Tourism Federation estimates the tourism sector will lose about Sh5 billion due to these cancellations. Coming at a time (mid-July to October) when Kenya receives the majority of tourists, the cancellations have hit the sector and the economy hard.

While we cannot bury our heads in the sand and pretend that the occasional fatal explosions are not a security threat, Kenyans must not give in. We must not allow those who mean harm for us to win, by stopping the work of nation building. Businesses, schools, hospitals and Government operations must go on even as we step up security surveillance.

It is time for Kenyans to show unity of purpose and tackle the terror threats. The recent explosions have demonstrated a cowardly enemy targeting anyone irrespective of age, class, tribe, religion or geographical area. The masterminds of terrorism are targeting Kenyans in an effort to sabotage their daily efforts to win war against poverty.
