
Disaster Management and Relief Minister Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya has set off for Thailand amidst growing demands for his resignation. Maya has faced much criticism since his claim that none of his family were involved in Narayanganj 7-murder. His son-in-law dismissed Army officer ex-Lt Col Tarek Sayeed Mohammad, also a former Rab officer, was arrested earlier this week for his suspected involvement with the multiple murders. The minister left for Thailand on Monday afternoon to attend an international conference on disaster management there, the ministry’s public relations officer Omar Faruk Dewan said. A joint secretary of the ministry is accompanying Maya on the visit. He is expected to return on May 22. Maya did not attend Monday’s cabinet meeting for the third consecutive time, according to bdnews24.com.
