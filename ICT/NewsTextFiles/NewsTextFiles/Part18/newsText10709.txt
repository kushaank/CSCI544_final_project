
The implementation of the Trans-Caspian gas pipeline will be a good opportunity to diversify the energy supply to EU countries, Malena Mard, head of EU Delegation to Azerbaijan told journalists on May 19.

She said that given the high demand for gas, the EU would like to import gas from Turkmenistan.

"The EU supports the Trans-Caspian gas pipeline project," Mard stressed.

The negotiations between the EU, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan on the Trans-Caspian gas pipeline began in September 2011.

A framework agreement on cooperation in deliveries of Turkmen natural gas to Turkey and further to Europe was signed between the governments of Turkmenistan and Turkey in July 2013 after the high-level talks in Ashgabat.

The project envisaging the laying of around 300 kilometers long gas pipeline under the Caspian to the shores of Azerbaijan is regarded as the optimal option for delivering Turkmen resources to European markets. Further, the Turkmen fuel can be delivered to Turkey which borders with European countries.

Ashgabat believes that for laying pipes under the Caspian Sea, the legal status of which has not yet been determined, the consent of both Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan and those territories covered by the project, is sufficient. Azerbaijan expressed its readiness to offer its territory, transit opportunities and infrastructure for the implementation of the project.
