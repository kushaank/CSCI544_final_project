
VietNamNet Bridge â€“ President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev is paying a working visit to Vietnam from May 18-20 at the invitation of President Truong Tan Sang, which aims to embrace bilateral economic ties.

Establishing diplomatic ties in 1992, Vietnam and Azerbaijan have enjoyed good political relations on the foundation of the traditional friendship built in the time of the Soviet Union. The exchange of high-level delegations was resumed in 2010 with a visit by Deputy Prime Minister Hoang Trung Hai.

Last year, Vice Chairman of National Assembly Uong Chu Luu and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Nguyen Phuong Nga also visited Azerbaijan.

The same year, Azerbaijan opened its embassy in Vietnam.

Both countries have also closely coordinated at the United Nations and international forums.

In 2010, the two countries signed an agreement on visa exemption for diplomatic passport holders and a protocol on cooperation between the two foreign ministries.

Their two-way trade reached 325 million USD in 2013, a tenfold increase from the previous year, with Vietnam exporting mainly mobile phones, computers, electronics and seafood while importing crude oil and petrol from the market.

The Vietnam National Oil and Gas Group (PetroVietnam) opened its office in Azerbaijan in 2011 with the aim of enhancing links with local partners. Vietnam is seeking to participate in some oil and gas projects in Azerbaijan.
