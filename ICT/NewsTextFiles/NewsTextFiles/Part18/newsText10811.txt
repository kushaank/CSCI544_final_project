According to the Russian official, President Putin ordered the defence minister for withdrawal of the troops to their permanent bases in Western Russia near Ukraine border, Xinhua reported.

Rasmussen also claimed Russia's action caused a negative effect on Ukraine.

"Russia's aggression against Ukraine has challenged right of states to choose their own path," he said.

Talking about the upcoming Ukrainian presidential election, he stressed its importance in accordance with international laws and standards.

"This is the vote that counts for Ukraine and the international community," he said.

Ukraine will hold early presidential election May 25, which the eastern regions of Donetsk and Lugansk have refused to recognise.
