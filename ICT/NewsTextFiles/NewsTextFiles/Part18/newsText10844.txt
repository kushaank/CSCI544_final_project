
Bangladesh has become the member of an Asian forum that works to enhance cooperation for peace, security and stability in the region.

The foreign ministry on Monday said all 25 members had “unanimously” decided to accept Bangladesh as a “full member” of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures (CICA).

The membership will be formalised on May 20, a day before the beginning of its fourth summit in Shanghai.

Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali will leave Dhaka on Monday, leading the Bangladesh delegation.

The foreign ministry considers the membership “strategically important” for Bangladesh.

It said, being one of the largest political entities in Asia, the forum had the potential “to create impact upon the politics of this continent”.

It also pursues multilateral cooperation in the fields of peace, security and stability in Asia, said a media release.

CICA can also facilitate trade expansion among the member states, particularly with Central Asian countries.

The foreign ministry said Bangladesh would try to promote trade and investment relations with the CICA member states.

Bangladesh, which had been an observer of the forum since 2010, would use it to project the country, it said.

The forum is based on the belief that there is close link between peace, security and stability in Asia and in the rest of the world.

Apart from members, the forum has 12 observers, including four organisations – UN, OSCE, Arab League, and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Turkic Speaking Countries (TURKPA).

Kazakhstan hosts the forum secretariat.
