SOUTH Australian abalone divers could soon be part of an international strategy to improve efficiency in abalone harvesting, including using technology and sharing electronic data about harvests.

South Australian Abalone Industry Association president Jonas Woolford said he recently attended a meeting in Adelaide with Abalone Council Australia members, along with representatives from the five abalone producing states of New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia as well as New Zealand.

Mr Woolford said the two-day workshop explored technological innovations for the industry and shared how research could help with compliance, management and harvesting.

He said one of the most exciting things they discussed was using an electronic logging system to enter catch information and provide computerised records of fishery data.

The industry is also exploring using tracking units on divers to follow where and how far they go.

Mr Woolford said there would be multiple ways for the technology to be applied, but the main hope was that it would allow the industry to become more efficient and the industry planned to work together to develop strategies to share information.

Mr Woolford said it could be some time before the efficiency initiatives were in place across the industry, but said South Australia's South East zone could implement some of the new technology alongside traditional data collection methods as a case study to determine cost benefits.

He also said it was good to see the collaboration between the five states and New Zealand.
