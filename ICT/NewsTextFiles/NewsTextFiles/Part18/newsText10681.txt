
VIENNA, AUSTRIA – Bearded drag queen Conchita Wurst has given her first public concert since her Eurovision victory this month, performing in Vienna on Sunday. She was greeted by thousands of fans, including gay couples. Many waved rainbow flags or wore fake beards.

Earlier, the Austrian was received by Chancellor Werner Faymann, who thanked Conchita for promoting tolerance. However, the concert was criticised by the conservative People’s Party, which is part of the coalition government.

Conchita Wurst was received by Chancellor Werner Faymann, who lauded her message of tolerance. Mr Faymann said it was an honour to have Conchita perform in Austria. “You showed a message from our country, from Europe, in a direction that is known as tolerance, love and lust for life,” he said.

Mr Faymann’s Social Democrats are hoping that Conchita’s win in Eurovision will spur on their coalition partners, the conservative People’s Party, to advance gay rights in Austria, including equal marriage rights, the BBC’s Bethany Bell reports from Vienna.

One senior conservative politician accused Mr Faymann of taking advantage of an artist for political gain, our correspondent adds. However, the People’s Party has said it will discuss gay rights issues by the summer.
