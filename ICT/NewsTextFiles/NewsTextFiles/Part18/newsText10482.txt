
KUALA LUMPUR: The authorities involved in the ensuing search for the missing Malaysian jetliner have agreed that the Chinese survey ship ‘Zhu Kezhen’ will conduct a bathymetric survey in the Southern Indian Ocean.

This was agreed to by the Malaysian, Australian and Chinese authorities who met over the weekend.

It said the bathymetric survey, involving an extensive mapping of the seabed, would be carried out in the area identified by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB).

“Zhu Kezhen is scheduled to sail for the survey area on Wednesday, weather permitting,” said JACC.

Bathymetric survey is one of the main priorities given in the search for the ill-fated Malaysia Airlines (MAS) flight MH370 which is now in its transition phase that prioritised ocean floor search. Other priorities include reanalysing the data to verify a more accurate search area as well as identifying and deploying relevant towed and autonomous underwater vehicles required for the terrain.

Beijing-bound Flight MH370 with 239 people on board vanished from radar screens on March 8 while over the South China Sea, about an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur.
