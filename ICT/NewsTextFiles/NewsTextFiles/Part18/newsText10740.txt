
Iran will export 10 billion liters of fuel oil and diesel in the current year.

Iranian deputy oil minister, Abbas Kazemi, said importing gasoline is economically justified, Iran's Mehr news agency reported on May 18.

Under the international sanctions, three petrochemical units produced gasoline, he said, adding that the domestically produced gasoline was mixed with octane boosters and was supplied to the market. But, there is no longer need to produce such gasoline.

He added that the expansion of CNG stations can prevent from excessive gasoline consumption.

The Iranian solar year starts on March 20.

On May 17, Iran's Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said the country will export gasoline in the next year once the Persian Gulf Start refinery's gasoline production unit comes on stream.

He added that once the Persian Gulf Start refinery's gasoline production unit comes on stream, the country no longer needs to import gasoline, Iran's ILNA news agency.

The facility will come on stream next Iranian calendar year.

Once the refinery comes on stream, the country's gasoline output will rise to 34 million liters per day. So, we can meet the domestic need and export about 15 million liters of gasoline per day, he said.

As we are planning to import premium gasoline as well, we may export a portion of the domestically produced gasoline, which is lower in terms of quality, he explained.

On May 11, Managing director of National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company (NIORDC), Abbas Kazemi, said Iran currently imports 5.5 million liters of gasoline per day.

He added that the average figure was around 3.5 million liters previous year, Iran's Tasnim News Agency reported.

"If the country's consumption rises, we need to import more gasoline," he explained.
