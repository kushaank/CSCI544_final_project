Tony Abbott and Queensland Premier Campbell Newman were among thousands who turned out to farewell the cattle identity near Rockhampton on Monday.

Mr Acton died on May 9, a week after he was critically injured when he fell from a horse while competing in a campdrafting event in central Queensland.

He was 62.

"To meet Graeme Acton once, just once, was to know him for life," The Morning Bulletin newspaper quoted Mr Abbott as saying.

"The hat, the voice, the face, the walk, marked him out as almost an iconic Australian.

"`I don't have small dreams', he once said."

Mr Acton's son Tom told those who attended the funeral that he'd known from a young age that his dad was someone special.

"Over the last couple of days and weeks, I've had much time to reflect on dad's life and his accomplishments," he said.

"It's been confirmed to me that he was certainly one of a kind."

Tom Acton said his father formed a love of riding horses and working the land when he was just a boy.

Mr Newman has described Mr Acton as an outstanding character who was loved by all.

"A hard-working Queenslander, he devoted his life to the land and growing the cattle industry in this state," he said earlier this month.

Mr Acton's funeral was held at his Paradise Lagoons property near Rockhampton, which is host to an annual campdraft event - a sport Mr Acton loved.

He headed Acton Land and Cattle - one of the country's largest farming operations.

The company owns 180,000 head of cattle on properties spanning about 1.58 million hectares.

Mr Acton is survived by his wife Jennie and their children Tom, Hayley, Victoria and Laura.
