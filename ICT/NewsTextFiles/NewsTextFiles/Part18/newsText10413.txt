
An executive at an Andover nursing home has worked out a correction plan with state officials after allegations of patient abuse.

The Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services fined Victoria Falls Skilled Nursing Center more than $155,000 for failure to meet regulations. The investigation of abuse and neglect targeting at least one resident receiving care, began in January.

Dennis Bush, CEO, said he did not learn specifics about the investigation until March. One employee was fired at that time, two other were suspended. Details about the allegations have not been released.

"We are continuing our own investigation as well one that will be ongoing until all of our questions and concerns are answered," Bush said. "We are working diligently to gather all of the facts and make any adjustments that may be necessary to ensure safety for our residents."

Bush declined to talk about the facility's plan of correction.

The Butler County district attorney said one employee has been charged with mistreatment of a dependent adult. The defendant is expected to appear in court June 16.

The facility will continue to be fined $1,000 per day until it becomes fully compliant. The nursing center will be allowed to take in new patients during that time.
