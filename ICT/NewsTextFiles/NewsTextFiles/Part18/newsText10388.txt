
Tata Global Beverages (TGB) has bought, through its overseas subsidiary based in the U.K., the entire stake in the equity capital of Bronski Eleven Pty Ltd., Australia.

TGB said that the Australian company was engaged in the roast-and-ground (R&G) coffee, and coffee in pods (single service portions) segments under the MAP brand in Australia.

The investment is in line with TGB’s strategic vision to become a leader in the good-for-you beverage segment in Australia, the company said in a stock exchange filing.

The buy also helped Tata Global Beverages expand its portfolio to include high-growth, contemporary single-serve business, it added.

The company, however, did not disclose the amount involved in the transaction.

A few years ago, Tata Global Beverages, then known as Tata Tea Ltd., embarked on a strategy to gradually defocus its plantation business and position itself as a beverage company.

It spun off its tea estates in Assam, West Bengal and in the South into separate companies, and started concentrating on the good-for-you beverage segment.

Over the last few years, it has made a string of purchases in the beverage segment.

It is now a global company, with 65 per cent of its revenue coming from outside India.

It said that 90 per cent of revenues come from sale of branded products in 40 countries with the remaining coming from the plantation and extractions.

The beverage positioning has been driven mainly by acquisitions, with two of its flagship brands – Tetley and Eight o Clock Coffee coming through that route. Besides tea and coffee, TGB is marking a major presence in fortified water segment too.
