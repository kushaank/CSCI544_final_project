
 NEW DELHI, May 19  Confusion prevails over the release of ULFA general secretary Anup Chetia, as Bangladesh suddenly handed over his family to Indian authorities two days back.

Sources said that the release of Anup Chetia is unlikely in the near future as there are several legal formalities to be completed by the Bangladesh government. Furthermore, the Bangladesh government is also monitoring the next move that the new Indian government takes towards Dhaka.
