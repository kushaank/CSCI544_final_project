
Borealis and Borouge, leading providers of innovative, value-creating plastic solutions for the automotive industry, have worked closely with the Renault-Nissan Alliance to develop a new range of polypropylene (PP) materials that meet the designated "Alliance Specifications" (AS). These specifications have been defined in accordance with the Renault-Nissan product portfolio strategy with the aim to apply them globally on all new cars. This follows the trend of using a focused PP product portfolio on common global OEM platforms such as the "Common Module Family" (CMF), the engineering architecture that covers Renault-Nissan Alliance vehicles for the global compact and large car segments to bring the cost-performance ratio to the next level. Borealis and Borouge support these efforts with their cutting edge PP materials.

 easy processing resulting in increased production efficiency;

 high scratch resistance;

 excellent surface aesthetics.

"At Borealis and Borouge, we are committed to developing cost-competitive and cutting-edge material solutions in line with the automotive industry's drive for cost efficiency, weight reduction and environmental performance," comments Harald Hammer, Borealis Vice President Application Segment Engineering Applications. "We were able to support the Renault-Nissan Alliance, the CMF C/D segment modular platform in particular, by aligning our strategy and putting in place the necessary resources to support the Alliance in key regions including the EU, Morocco, Russia, Brazil, India, Japan, China, as well as North America in the near future."

"The strong, worldwide cooperation between Renault-Nissan and Borealis and Borouge has enabled us to apply cutting-edge technology and develop this exciting new global portfolio of AS grades for the Renault-Nissan Alliance," adds Jost Laumeyer, Marketing Manager, Borealis Engineering Applications.

Franck Lagoutte, Global OEM Manager, highlighted: "Our PP materials deliver maximum value and optimum performance for the Nissan Qashqai, and will also be used on other vehicles from the CMF modular platform in the coming months such as the new Nissan X-Trail. Borealis and Borouge strive to provide weight and costs savings to the Alliance with new generations of dashboard, bumper and other structural parts, such as our FibremodTM family of PP reinforced fibre materials used in various structural applications such as front end modules, air intake manifolds and tailgate structures. These innovative PP grades offer new potential for sustainable auto parts, helping to make vehicles lighter, leading to improved fuel economy and lower CO2 emissions."
