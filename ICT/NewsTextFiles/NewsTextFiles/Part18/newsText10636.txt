
A DARWIN fisho has hooked more than he probably bargained for when he reeled in this massive Queensland ­groper on a trip to Shoal Bay over the weekend.

Reader Ash White sent this incredible picture of her mate Ray to the NT News.

She reckons the fish, which was released, is the biggest she’s ever seen.

NT News’ resident fishing expert Dave Krantz estimated the monster fish could weigh at least 100kg.

The giant groper, or Queensland groper, is one of the largest species of bony fish in the world. They can grow to a length of 2m and weigh up to 400kg.

Groper live on reefs and can be found around the Australian coastline from NSW to WA, and are common in the Territory.

It’s not the first time a massive specimen of the species has been caught – two were caught by schoolboys at Mandorah jetty last year.

In May, Grey Hiram and a group of friends were fishing with a 45kg leader and queenfish bait when they hooked up.

“My mate Luke was bringing the line in ’cause he thought he had lost his bait,” he said.

In October, Darwin High School student Rhys McAway had to call on the help of his friend Andy Moller to reel in another whopper.

Read the story you professional whingers, caught at shaol bay not dragged up to the jettty, it may be protected so what is the fisho to do? shake him off the line? You people dont like fishermen then you are living in the wrong part of the world.

Watch this 86 find its fate in an Armco fence.
