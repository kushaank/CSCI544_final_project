
A SUNSHINE Coast company that sold allegedly faulty circuit breakers that caused at least 70 burnouts in rooftop solar panel arrays has gone bust, leaving tens of thousands of homeowners at risk of electrical fires.

Advancetech went into receivership on Friday, only four days after Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie ordered an immediate recall of 27,600 Avanco-branded DC solar power isolators imported and sold by the company.

On its website, the company said it rejected findings by the State Government's Electrical Safety Office that two of its Avanco-branded DC isolators were faulty.

The devices, including PV Power-branded DC isolators from another company, have been blamed for causing more than 50 fires.

Authorities say the devices need to be switched off immediately and replaced.

A spokesman for Mr Bleijie said yesterday that the circumstances of Advancetech going into receivership were being investigated.

He told ABC Radio the company's receivers had to continue to replace the devices.
