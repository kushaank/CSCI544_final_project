
Albania plans to auction off 13 exploration blocks—12 onshore and one offshore block—to local and foreign companies. The auction follows a discovery in November by Royal Dutch Shell and Petromanas Energy Inc of good quality oil and gas in test flows from their first well in Shpirag, southern Albania. Last September, there was a regime change in Albania following the botched privatization of state-owned Albpetrol. The new Socialist-led government’s Energy and Mining Minister, Damian Gjiknuri, said they would no longer be negotiating contracts one-on-one with foreign oil companies due to the “much higher interest over the past several months.” For interested parties, OP Tactical has a localized network on the ground in Albania and full due diligence capabilities.
