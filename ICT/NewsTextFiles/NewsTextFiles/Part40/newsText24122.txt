
Mexico City-based VivaAerobus formally launched its fleet transition to A320 aircraft after the airline started operating its first three Airbus A320 aircraft in April. The low cost carrier will receive an additional two A320s before the end of 2014. The A320s, powered by IAE, are configured in an all economy 180 seat configuration, 32 additional seats for a 22 percent increase in capacity as compared to VivaAerobus’ existing fleet of 737-300s.

The A320s will bring VivaAerobus improved fuel efficiency, performance and range, allowing the airline to ultimately expand its network service throughout Mexico and beyond. The aircraft will be based in the airline’s Cancun hub and fly to Mexico City, Monterrey, Veracruz, Tuxtla Gutierrez, Reynosa and Torreon. Additionally, the aircraft will operate from Mexico City to Reynosa and from Monterrey to Mazatlan.

By the end of 2016, the airline will have completed its fleet transition from 737-300 to become an all-Airbus operator. In October 2013 VivaAerobus signed a purchase agreement for 52 Airbus A320 Family aircraft (40 A320neo and 12 A320ceo), representing the biggest Airbus aircraft order by a single airline in Latin American history.
