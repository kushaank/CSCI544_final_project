
STURGIS, Mich. (AP) – A southwestern Michigan prosecutor has called for the firing of a state trooper who pulled a gun on an 18-year-old woman he’d stopped for speeding.

The Kalamazoo Gazette  says state police asked St. Joseph County Prosecutor John McDonough to investigate the April 15 traffic stop on U.S. 12 near Sturgis.

Authorities say the woman was driving 77 miles per hour in a 55 mph zone and stopped about 35 seconds after the trooper activated his lights and siren. They say she was rushing home because her home had been burglarized.

A video shows the trooper leaving his cruiser with gun drawn, then handcuffing the woman.

The trooper says he was thinking about the 2013 fatal shooting of Trooper Paul Butterfield II during a traffic stop. He’s on paid leave.
