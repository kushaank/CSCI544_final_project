THE controversial Watermark open-cut mine near Gunnedah has been recommended for approval by the NSW Department of Planning.

The Chinese-owned project has been the object of substantial opposition from environmentalists and from farmers in the Liverpool Plains area.

Reports posted on the department’s website  say its ‘‘benefits outweigh its residual costs, and that it is in the public interest and should be approved, subject to stringent conditions’’.

Caroona Coal Action Group spokesman Tim Duddy said Watermark was being recommended for approval despite big questions over its impacts on the Namoi River and alluvial aquifer.

Watermark will now be reviewed by the Planning Assessment Commission before a final decision by the state government.
