
Thailand's army has declared martial law throughout the country, but denies it's part of a coup.

The development comes days after the head of the army issued a stern warning for protesters to avoid violence over political tensions.

Lieutenant General Nipat Thonglek has told CNN the move is not a coup, and they're still working out the precise restrictions they'll impose under martial law.
