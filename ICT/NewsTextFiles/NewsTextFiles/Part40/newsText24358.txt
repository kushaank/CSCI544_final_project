U.S. Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.), a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, and U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), a veteran of the Iraq war and a member of the House Armed Services Committee, introduced the Servicemembers Insurance Relief Act (H.R. 4669) yesterday. The bill is expected to be referred to the House Financial Services Committee.

The bill aims to make the state-based insurance regulatory system more accommodating to service members who currently have to change auto insurance policies every time they relocate across state lines.

“This bipartisan legislation makes a simple but meaningful change to current law that will lessen the burden on service members and their families during times of transition,” said Rep. Royce.
