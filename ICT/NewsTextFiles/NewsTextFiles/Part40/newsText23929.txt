
The centre is located at Logic Media’s headquarters just outside Frankfurt and is aimed at providing local support for existing and future customers in Germany.

The service centre will handle Nevion’s full suite of media transport and broadcast solutions. These are increasingly based on IP technology and are designed to help broadcasters and service providers transport media over any network from acquisition to home.

“We’re helping customers on the journey towards an IP future as managing and transporting professional quality audio and video reliably in real-time is challenging, so it’s important that we can offer strong local technical support” said Kjetil Bonde, Nevion senior vice-president of sales for Europe.

Nevion and Logic Media will exhibit at ANGA COM in hall 10.2, booth L33.
