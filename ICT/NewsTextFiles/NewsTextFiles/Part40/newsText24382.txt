
JAMMU: The army has recovered half-a-dozen Pakistan-made landmines and other equipment along the  LoC in Khour area of Akhnoor sector in Jammu district. The recoveries were made during search operations carried out after a jawan was killed and two other soldiers were injured in the area in firing from across the border on Sunday.

"In an incident near Akhnoor yesterday a patrol of the Army was targeted by mines and small-arms fire by a group of unidentified armed personnel," PRO Defence, Jammu, said in a statement. "[Our] own troops returned effective fire and the group fled back across the LoC towards a Pakistan Army post." Sepoy Bhikale Uttam Balu died in the firefight, while the two other soldiers suffered splinter injuries and gunshot wounds.

"Search of the area yielded Pakistan-made mines and other equipment, which clearly suggests the involvement of Pakistan and terrorists from across the LoC," the army statement said.

A senior Army officer told PTI it was possibly an attack by Pakistan's Border Action Team (BAT). "We're investigating into it," he said.

BAT, which is a mix of Pakistani special forces personnel and terrorists, had killed two Indian soldiers last January, one of whom was beheaded, and killed five personnel along the LoC in Poonch sector seven months later.
