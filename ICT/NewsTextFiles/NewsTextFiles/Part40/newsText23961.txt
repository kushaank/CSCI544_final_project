
U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran's adult children said they're shocked someone apparently tried to use their mother's debilitating dementia for political purposes as their father seeks re-election.

Conservative blogger Clayton Thomas Kelly was arrested Friday and charged with exploiting a vulnerable adult after authorities said he photographed bedridden Rose Cochran in a Mississippi nursing home and posted a photo online as part of an anti-Cochran video.

In a statement the Cochran campaign released first to The Associated Press on Monday, Clayton and Kate Cochran said their mother has lived at St. Catherine's Village for 13 years.

"It is amazing and humbling to see how devoted our dad has been as mother has progressed from early dementia, to complete loss of language to her current state of hospice care," they said.
