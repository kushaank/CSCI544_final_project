
U.S. fresh potatoes are now allowed into all of Mexico.

The Mexican government has implemented its final rule to allow U.S. fresh potatoes to enter all of Mexico, according to a joint news release from the National Potato Council and the United States Potato Board.

This action, effective May 19, is part of a bilateral agreement that facilitates trade in fresh potatoes between the two countries, according to the release.

Previous to this, U.S. potato exports were limited to a 16-mile zone south of the U.S./Mexico border. Because of the expanded market access, potato industry sources believe the value of annual fresh potato exports from the U.S. to Mexico could jump from $30 million to $100 million under the new agreement.

“The NPC and USPB support this bilateral trade agreement as it will benefit potato growers in Mexico and the United States, as well as the processing industries and consumers in both countries,” the release said. The Mexican market has room to grow, according to the release, as per capita potato consumption in Mexico is lower than the U.S..

The USPB will conduct market development programs in Mexico to increase demand for all potatoes in Mexico, according to the release.
