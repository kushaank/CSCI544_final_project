
An RAF spy plane sent by David Cameron to help find hundreds of school girls kidnapped in Nigeria by Islamist militants has broken down en route.

In an embarrassing setback, the Sentinel aircraft suffered a technical problem after it took off from RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire.

The planeâ€™s five-man crew decided to push on rather than turn back but eventually had to land at an air base in Senegal.

The technical problem is being investigated but it is unclear when the reconnaissance aircraft will be given the green light to resume its rescue mission.
