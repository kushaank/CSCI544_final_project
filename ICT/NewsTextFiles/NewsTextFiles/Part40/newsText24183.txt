
The Indonesian Navy says it is investigating a possible violation of Indonesian territory by Malaysia on Tanjung Datuk Island, which is located on the border between Indonesia's West Kalimantan and Malaysia's Sarawak.

Unconfirmed reports on Monday said that the Indonesian Navy in the regional capital of Pontianak had received information about the alleged border violation from Pontianak’s Navigation District Office on Saturday.

According to the information, a signal light is being installed on Tanjung Datuk by Malaysia and the country has violated Indonesian territory in the area.

The Navy has sent a ship to the island and a Navy aircraft has taken aerial photographs of the activities in the disputed area, the Antara news agency reported.

As of Sunday, activities to install the signal light were continuing on the island.

The Navy headquarters in Jakarta also reportedly confirmed that it had sent a Navy ship to the location in order to verify the allegations.

A Navy official in Pontianak, who refused to be identified, confirmed the Navy is still investigating the issue.
