
PITTSBURGH (AP) ― Billionaire media mogul Richard Mellon Scaife says he has an untreatable form of cancer.

Scaife is the publisher of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review and owner of Trib Total Media. He said in a column published Sunday that he learned of his diagnosis recently.

The 81-year-old Scaife is an heir to the Mellon banking fortune and is a notable backer of conservative causes. He serves as the vice chairman of the board of the Heritage Foundation.

Scaife says some who dislike him may “rejoice” at the news of his diagnosis, but he “can’t share their enthusiasm.” He went on to say none of the causes he’s supported give him such a great sense of accomplishment as the newspaper business.

Last year, Forbes estimated Scaife’s worth at $1.4 billion.
