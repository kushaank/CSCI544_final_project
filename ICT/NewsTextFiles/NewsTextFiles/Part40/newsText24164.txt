
Nogales police and the fire marshal are investigating a fire at a Bowman Street home Friday evening that left a mother and daughter homeless.

Investigators collected evidence at the scene that will now be examined at a crime lab, said NPD Lt. Carlos Jimenez, who offered no additional information.

The Nogales Fire Department received the initial call at 7:57 p.m. on Friday after the fire started in a vehicle parked next to the home, NFD Chief Hector Robles said. The flames jumped to the eaves of the structure, and it took firefighters approximately an hour-and-a-half to douse the fire.

“The guys did an awesome job in containing that to just some roof damage and part of the eaves,” said Robles, who couldn’t immediately provide a dollar estimate for the damage.

The Southern Arizona Chapter of the American Red Cross Disaster Action Team said it provided lodging, food and clothing to the mother and daughter who were displaced by the fire.
