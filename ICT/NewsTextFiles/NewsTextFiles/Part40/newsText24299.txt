WASHINGTON — The Pentagon announced May 16 that it has passed on a request to Congress for a sale of 3,335 Humvees to Mexico in a deal that would be worth $556 million.

Sources familiar with the FMS case tell Defense News the sale would involve new vehicles manufactured by South Bend, Indiana, Humvee maker AM General, as opposed to coming from excess stocks no longer used by the US Army or Marines.

Most foreign military sales (FMS) deals to long-term allies like Mexico are quickly approved by Congress, and the deal would be good news for AM General, which has publicly worried about its manufacturing facilities now that the Army and Marines have discontinued buying new Humvees.

Both services do plan to upgrade and service thousands of Humvees for years to come, however.

The company also is one of three in the running for the follow-on Joint Light Tactical Vehicle program, which would replace many of the Humvees in use by the Army and Marines.

Just last week, the Pentagon announced another potential sale of 200 Humvees to Iraq.

The Mexico deal would include the new vehicles along with associated equipment, parts, training and logistical support, according to a statement.
