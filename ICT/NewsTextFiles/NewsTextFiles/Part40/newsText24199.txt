
MANILA, Philippines - The Air Force is ready to provide a plane and technical personnel for the government’s cloud-seeding operations as part of the efforts to mitigate the impact of El Niño phenomenon.

Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Enrico Canaya said the Bureau of Soils and Water Management (BSWM) have sought the help of their technicians who know how to conduct cloud-seeding.

“We have personnel who have background on how to conduct cloud-seeding so they requested our personnel to join,” he said.

Canaya said for now, those involved in the cloud-seeding are using the aircraft of the BSWM.

The Air Force, Canaya said, is ready to provide a Cessna LC 210 plane if necessary.

“We also have aircraft. The Air Force is willing to provide requirements to mitigate the effects of the drought or El Niño, through cloud seeding,” he added.

The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) has said the El Niño would bring below-average rainfall in the last quarter of this year until the first quarter of 2015.

Officials have urged the public to conserve water even as they maintained that the government is ready for the effects of the dry spell.

The Agriculture department has expressed readiness to conduct cloud-seeding over farm areas that have not received rainfall for seven to 10 days.

Agriculture regional offices have been ordered to monitor the situation in their respective areas and to coordinate with the BSWM if cloud-seeding operations are necessary.
