Thailand’s army declared martial law early Tuesday “to restore peace and order” after months of antigovernment protests, but stressed that a military coup was not underway.

Soldiers entered several private television stations in Bangkok, the capital, after a predawn statement signed by the army chief, Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, which said that ongoing political rallies “could impact the country’s security and safety of the lives and properties of the public,” the Bangkok Post reported on its website.

Many people went about their daily lives following the declaration of martial law in Thailand, with some snapping 'selfies' in front of military troops.

The Thai army has staged 11 successful coups since 1932.

The move threw the Southeast Asian kingdom into further political uncertainty amid months of protests and political maneuvering by supporters and opponents of the beleaguered government. More than 20 people have died in seven months of protests that have occasionally paralyzed Bangkok.
