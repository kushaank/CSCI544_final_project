
HOUMA, La. (AP)  Officials say the search to replace longtime Fletcher Technical Community College chancellor Travis Lavigne could take up to a year.

Lavigne's 42-year tenure will end in mid-June, and recently appointed Interim Chancellor Earl Meador will then take over the position until a permanent replacement is found.

"This is an excellent decision by the board to appoint someone familiar with this region and who has an established record of successful leadership for the technical colleges in this community," Lavigne said.

"The interim will most likely be the acting chancellor throughout the next school year," Thornton said.

Quintin Taylor, executive director of media relations for the Louisiana Technical College System, said search time varies by institution and finding the right fit for the college weighs heavily on the time of year the search is conducted.

"For a search on an institution like Fletcher, we can't place a time on that," Taylor said. "I think the most important thing is finding the right person to fill those huge shoes that Travis is leaving behind."

He noted that typically, the most optimal time to perform a chancellor search is during the spring semester, which will give students, faculty and community members as well as the search committee enough time to get to know the candidates.

Performing the search during spring also gives potential candidates enough time to decide if they will make summer vacation plans or seek other opportunities, he said.

"Summer really isn't the best time because faculty really isn't around, the bulk of your students aren't around and when you look at the national scene, there are also potential candidates who may be on vacation or preparing for the start of the fall semester," Taylor said.
