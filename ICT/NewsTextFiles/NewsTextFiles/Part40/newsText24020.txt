
The DPRK's official Korean Central News Agency has reported a "serious" building collapse at a construction site in the country’s capital. Government officials have offered a rare public apology.

Earlier, we spoke to Rafael Wober, a senior video journalist with the Associated Press in Pyongyang. He told us about what he learnt there, and the significance of the rare move.

Just over 24 hours since this news first came out....It was an announcement from state agency KCNA, and really since then, there has been no other source...said the accident took place last Tuesday...the report focused on the apologies from senior officials...there’s been no further detail, in terms of casualty numbers...not possible to go to the site to see what happened there...It was a surprise that this kind of news appeared in DPRK state media for the first time in anybody’s living memory here. However, it’s important to emphasize that very careful control is being maintained....that still a very strong way of maintaining of news control here."
