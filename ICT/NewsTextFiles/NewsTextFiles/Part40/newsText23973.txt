
The anti-Islam group American Freedom Defense Initiative has a new ad campaign that will be seen on Washington buses this week showing Adolf Hitler meeting with Muslim leader Haj Amin al-Husseini.

According to the Washington Times , the initiative was created by  conservative activist Pamela Geller and the picture will be displayed on 20 Metro buses for a month.

The ad advocates an end to U.S. foreign aid to Islamic countries and comes as a response, she says, to ads placed on the bus system last month by American Muslims for Palestine.

"My intent is leapfrog over a media that is not even-handed, that is advancing the propaganda against the Jewish state," the newspaper quotes Geller as saying. "Many folks are supporting the ad. I've gotten hundreds of emails in support of the ad. Let's be even-handed."

According to the Jewish Daily Forward , the ads show a photograph of Hitler and the grand mufti of Jerusalem with the line "Islamic Jew-hatred: It's in the Quran."

Nihad Awad, national executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, has denounced the new ads.

"This is a propaganda campaign designed to incite hatred against American Muslims, and this campaign has been based on false information, taking things out of context from the Quran," he says, according to the Washington Times. He is also considering offering free copies of the Koran in response.
