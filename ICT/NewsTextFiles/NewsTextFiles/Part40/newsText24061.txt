
Anybody in the market for a home lately knows the story. If only I had bought last year.

The graphic to your right tells the tale. The city of Dallas expects property values to peak this year at just above $91 billion.

That’s good news for the city obviously and for people who invested in Dallas in the lean years.

The figure comes from the city’s latest budget briefing, which puts the gap between expected revenue and expenditures at $30 million.

Based on many years covering City Hall, this is not the sort of figure that gets me worked up. When the gap crests $100 million, let me know. The real day I will be shocked is when city management comes to the council with a budget in May and says, guess what, we are planning to spend less then we expect to bring in. Not going to happen.

No, the important figure here isn’t the $30 million, it’s the $91.1 billion. I actually expect that figure will grow by the time we pass the budget (may I not be forced to eat those words).

Dallas has made some very good investments in its future. We need to acknowledge that. There are corridors of the city that are restored and revived. But we still have a long, long way to go. Yes, parts of Dallas are very valuable. Bigger parts aren’t. That’s where my focus is generally.

But right now, I’m going to celebrate the city’s growth.

The Dallas Morning News Editorial Board was the first editorial board in the nation to use a blog to openly discuss hot topics and issues among its members and with readers. Our intent is to pull back the curtain on the daily process of producing the unsigned editorials that reflect the opinion of the newspaper, and to share analysis and opinion on issues of interest to board members and invited guest bloggers.
