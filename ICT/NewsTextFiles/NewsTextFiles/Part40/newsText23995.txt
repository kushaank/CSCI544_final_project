
If the rumours are to believed, then Google’s YouTube has reached a deal to acquire the video game streaming platform Twitch for more than $1 billion.

If this deal is completed,this acquisition would be the most significant in the history of YouTube, which Google acquired in 2006 for $1.65 billion.

Twitch’s PR Director said on Twitter that “Twitch doesn’t comment on rumors.” Google hasn’t made an official statement yet either, but the report claims that the deal should be announced soon.

According to reports in February,Twitch had ranked fourth in peak internet traffic in the U.S., which put it ahead of Valve, Facebook, Hulu, and other huge internet companies. It accounted for 1.8 percent of peak internet traffic.

Twitch was launched in June 2011 by co-founders of Justin.tv Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, and has subsequently become the go-to space for user-generated streaming and an integral part of the vision behind next-gen hardware.
