
The Russian Defense Ministry is in talks to create several naval re-supply and maintenance bases in the Middle East, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly Antonov said in an interview with Kuwait's KUNA news agency on Monday.

"We consistently develop our military cooperation with Middle East countries. Naturally, Russia is interested in having re-supply and maintenance bases for our navy in several states in the region. And we are engaged in talks on the issue with certain states," the agency quoted Antonov as saying.

Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said in February that Russia may create a network of bases abroad, in countries that include Vietnam, Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua, the Seychelles, and Singapore. Moscow currently has only one naval base outside the former Soviet Union in Tartus, Syria, but the fate of this naval facility is uncertain because of the ongoing civil war in that country. Post-Soviet Russia closed a large naval base in Vietnam and a radar base in Cuba in 2002 due to financial constraints.
