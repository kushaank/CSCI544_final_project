
New Mexico lost 4.8 percent of its construction jobs in the 12 months that ended April 30, putting it near dead last among the states and the District of Columbia in terms of growth in construction jobs, the Associated General Contractors of America said Monday. Only New Jersey was worse, losing 6.8 percent of its construction jobs over the same period.

Over the year, the state lost 2,000 construction jobs, and as of April 30 it had 39,800 jobs, 33.3 percent below the peak of 59,600 in May and June 2006, and the lowest number of construction jobs since the recession, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics .

Over the month, New Mexico lost 1,100 construction jobs for a 2.7 percent decline â€” a 50th place rank, the ACG said.

Mike Beck , executive director of the Associated General Contractors of New Mexico, said the state has seen a â€œtremendous dropoff in the amount of funding for highway construction at the state and national levelâ€� since the recession.

Congress has yet to approve a new Highway Trust Fund bill, and if it doesnâ€™t take action soon, the state could run short of highway construction money in early July, Beck said.

The New Mexico Department of Transportation has an $850 million budget, but only about $150 million to $200 million goes to road projects, Beck said. The rest goes to running the department and paying off bonds that were bought to finance previous road projects.
