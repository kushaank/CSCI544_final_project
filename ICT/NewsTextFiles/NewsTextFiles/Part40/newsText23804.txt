
Roanoke native Jason McNeil was once a freelance columnist for the The Roanoke Times, contributing to the rotating lineup of “The Front Porch” in the now-defunct Neighbors section.

His next role draws on the horrors of real life rather than fantasy. He portrays legendary rock producer Terry Melcher in the forthcoming film “House of Manson,” a new look at murderous cult leader Charles Manson and his followers, known as the Manson Family. Over two days in 1969, Manson and his followers massacred seven people in Los Angeles, including actress Sharon Tate, who was pregnant.

Melcher, who produced such hits as The Byrds’ “Turn! Turn! Turn!”, met Manson the year before the murders and considered giving him a record contract, but ultimately declined, alarmed by Manson’s behavior. Melcher later sublet his house to Tate and her husband, Roman Polanski. The Manson Family killed Tate and four friends on Aug. 9, 1969. One of the cult members later testified in court that the murders were intended to terrify Melcher.
