
An analysis from GovTribe has found that the Army is the top protested Defense Department agency over the past 18 months, with 891 protests, according to Nextgov .

The Veterans Affairs Department tops the list as the most protested non-defense agency, with more than 400 protests. GovTribe says the Army had a 7 percent protest rate and VA had a 6 percent rate. Some awards are protested more than once and not all protests are public, so the statistic may be misleading. In all protests between September 2012 and May 13, GAO dismissed 65 percent and sustained 2 percent. In the remaining cases, agencies likely took corrective action on their own, causing GAO to dismiss the protest.
