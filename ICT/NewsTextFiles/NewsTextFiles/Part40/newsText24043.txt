
The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has said none of its facilities was affected by the fire explosion that occurred on Sunday near its jetty in Okirika local government area of Rivers State.

This is as the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) claimed responsibility for the explosion which killed no fewer than seven persons while scores of others were severally injured.

The executive director, Services, Port Harcourt Refinery Company, Mr Ralph Ugwu, told newsmen at Alesa-Eleme, that none of the company’s staff was killed or injured.

Ugwu explained that contrary to the claim in some quarters, only a boat belonging to a group of oil thieves was affected by the explosion, pointing out that operations at the jetty and the refineries were not affected.

On why permission was not given to the media to get to the scene of the incident, the executive director explained that the explosion took place in the creek, adding that it was not possible for the company to open the gate for everybody in a state of uncertainty.

However, MEND in an online statement signed by its spokesman, Jomo Gbomo, claimed that the explosion was a deliberate act of sabotage in tandem with what the militant group themed ‘Operation Hurricane Exodus’.
