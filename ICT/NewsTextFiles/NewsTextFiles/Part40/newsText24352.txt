
TEL AVIV (JTA) — Dozens of Israeli reserve soldiers protested settler violence outside the West Bank settlement of Yitzhar.

Yitzhar was the site of a settler attack against an Israeli army patrol last month. Earlier this month, Yitzhar Rabbi Yitzchak Ginsburgh blamed the Israel Defense Forces and the Israeli government for provoking the attack.

In recent weeks, a spate of “price tag” attacks intended to exact a price for Israeli government policies seen as detrimental to the settlement enterprise have been carried out in Israel and the West Bank.
