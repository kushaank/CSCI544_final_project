
KARACHI – Former president Pervez Musharraf was exempted from appearing before the court on Monday to attend proceedings of the murder case of Akbar Bugti, a former head of the Jamhoori Watan Party.

The court summoned Musharraf on June 16, and ordered guarantors of the former ruler to ensure his presence during future hearings. Musharraf, who has been indicted by a special court for treason, has been on bail in three other major cases dating to his time in power, including one relating to the 2006 assassination of Akbar Bugti during a military operation.

Bugti led an armed campaign to press for ‘provincial’ autonomy and a ‘greater share’ of profits from natural resources of Balochistan. His murder sparked deadly protests besides an armed insurgency in the province.
