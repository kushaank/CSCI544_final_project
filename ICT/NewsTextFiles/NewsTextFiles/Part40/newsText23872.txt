
This refers to Ayaz Amir’s article, ‘Course correction for Pakistani democracy’ (May 16). The writer has once again emphasised that our rulers should wake up to ground realities and keep away from self inflicting wounds. While deliberating on the FIA inquiry report that formed the basis of Musharraf's treason case, the writer has rightly summed up by saying that “chances are he (judge) would recommend eggs and tomatoes in a public square for the authors of this inquiry. Such is its high calibre”. The writer has rightly criticised Ch Nisar who used sectarian clashes in Rawalpindi to divert the attention of the public and opened the treason case without going into the merits of the case.

Things are piling up again, the media stands badly divided, political parties are not on the same page. The prime minister needs to come out of his kitchen cabinet and see for himself the dangers that are looming over his head. The writer’s word of caution is timely and must be taken seriously by the government if things are to improve.
