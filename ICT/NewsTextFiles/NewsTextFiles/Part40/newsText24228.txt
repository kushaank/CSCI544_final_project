
LAHORE: The treasury in Punjab Assembly on Monday scuttled an opposition move to present a pro-army resolution, by immediately drafting their own that too showed solidarity with the institution but with a different undertone.

PML-Q Parliamentary Leader Moonis Elahi on a point of order sought permission from the chair to present a pro-army resolution but Deputy Speaker Sher Ali Gorchani who was in the chair said he would allow it after the Question Hour.

On the speakerâ€™s refusal to entertain the request, the Q members stood up and kept repeating their demand.

The speaker, meanwhile, started the Question Hour. The house remained out of order for 20 or so minutes and eventually the opposition (PML-Q, PTI and Jamaat-i-Islami) boycotted the proceedings against Mr Gorchaniâ€™s attitude.

The speaker sent three members from the treasury to bring the opposition back to their benches with the â€˜promiseâ€™ that it would be given time to present its resolution.

As the opposition returned to the house, Moonis again sought permission to table the resolution. He also offered the treasury to table a â€˜joint resolutionâ€™ after mutual consultation.

The speaker said the treasury wanted an â€˜amendedâ€™ resolution. As Rana Sanaullah did not invite the opposition for consultation, Moonis said it seemed the treasury was taking time because it had to take â€˜directionsâ€™ from Raiwind (a reference to the Sharifs).

Meanwhile, Rana Sanaullah also got prepared a pro-army resolution that was different in details from the PML-Qâ€™s. The speaker, instead of allowing Moonis, asked Rana Sanaullah to present the treasuryâ€™s resolution.

AT this, Moonis reminded Mr Gorchani of his â€˜promiseâ€™ to allow the opposition to present its resolution.

â€œI had asked you to wait till Question Hour for presentation of your resolution but you did not agree. Now I cannot give you time for it,â€� replied the speaker.

This prompted the opposition parties to stage another boycott of the proceedings, and in their absence Rana Sanaullah read out the resolution that was adopted immediately.

A PTI MPA pointed out the quorum but the speaker said he was late for this.

Though both resolutions were pro-army, the Qâ€™s demanded only condemnation of those involved in defaming the institution, whereas the Nâ€™s also rapped the attempts to achieve â€œvested interestâ€� under the cover of showing solidarity with the army.

Moonis Elahi regretted the speakerâ€™s attitude, saying Mr Gorchani should have shown impartiality.

â€œAt least the PML-N which was earlier distancing itself from the armyâ€™s support had to adopt a pro-army amended resolution on our pressure,â€� Moonis claimed.

Earlier, the session began two-and-a-half hour behind its schedule. Treasuryâ€™s working out a strategy vis-a-vis the Qâ€™s resolution reportedly caused the delay.

I feel by bringing pro army resolutions and people coming on streets with pro army slogans, are indirectly encouraging and inviting army in the politics. It is not in the national interest to involve army in any political matter and need not bringing either resolutions or coming on streets, as we all love our army and respect them but that should be restricted to their security job.

Oh, What a rubbish comments of Hammad about Mr. Moonis Elahi. The family of Mr. Moonis Elahi is the most respectable family in Pakistani politics. He is a noble man and allegations against him are baseless.

Moonis Elahi is only leader who bring the pro army resolution in the Punjab Assembly, Blocking the resolution clearly shows malice and enmity against army and also against the Pakistan as well. Great Moonis Elahi!

I am not a political supporter of PML-Q but I must admit that the family of Chaudhry's is very noble, respectable  and honest. So please don't put the foolish comments about Moonis Elahi and his family.
