
Israeli Messianic leader Moti Cohen recently traveled to neighboring Jordan with a group of fellow Jewish and Arab believers to provide aid to the over half-a-million Syrian refugees who have gathered there.

He is also quick to point out that the classic “good guy – bad guy” dichotomy does not exist in Syria. “Both the Islamic rebels and Assad’s army kill everybody in their way,” says Cohen, after meeting with countless refugees, many of them children.

But the unbelievably tragic situation does have a silver lining, as Cohen and his associates were able to share and pray with many of the Syrian Muslims, as well as present a very different face of Israel from what most Syrians are taught.
