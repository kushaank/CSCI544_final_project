
IDF officials are expressing concerns over the train line to Sderot because much of the route is exposed to incoming rockets in the event of an attack. IDF officials realize the train traveling between Ashkelon and Sderot may be targeted by Gazan terrorists.

Military officials report terrorists in Gaza are observing the line, which in some areas is only hundreds of meters from the border. It is explained that a video of the train’s operations was found in the possession of a senior Hamas terrorist recently taken into custody.

Israel Railways officials’ and IDF commanders have been meeting to address the issue and decide what measures must be taken. The military has suggested a number of fixes but they are expensive, in the area of tens of millions of shekels. The IDF has passed its recommendations to the government which will have to decide how to handle the matter.
