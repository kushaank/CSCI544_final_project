
DALLAS--( BUSINESS WIRE )--The world’s leading breast cancer organization today announced the        launch of a national, online, bilingual Breast Cancer Education Toolkit        for Hispanic/Latino Communities.

This free resource will provide Susan G. Komen, its global network of        Affiliates and community organizations nationwide with culturally and        linguistically relevant breast cancer information to reach        Hispanic/Latina women.

This large and fast-growing population, which accounts for about 50        million Americans, is disproportionately affected by breast cancer. An        estimated 17,100 cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in        Hispanic/Latina women in the U.S. in 2012, the latest year available;        and 2,400 were expected to die of the disease. Breast cancer is the most        commonly diagnosed cancer in Hispanic/Latina women in the U.S.

Compared to non-Hispanic white women, Hispanic/Latina women are more        likely to be diagnosed with more advanced, larger and/or more        difficult-to-treat breast cancer tumors. This difference has been        largely attributed to longer intervals between mammograms as well as the        lack of timely follow-up of an abnormal mammogram.

However, even when Hispanic/Latina women are diagnosed at a similar age        and stage as non-Hispanic white women, they are more likely to die of        breast cancer, likely due to differences in access to care and treatment.

To address this disparity, Komen and its longstanding partner, the        Mexican Embassy, sought to create an educational resource that could be        utilized by the Ventanillas de Salud (Windows of Health) program        and far beyond, with opportunities for use extending to Komen’s nearly        2,000 community partners across the country and to educators and        organizations around the U.S.

The Toolkit augments more than $89 million in research that Komen has        invested in understanding and addressing breast cancer disparities.

The Toolkit offers resources to both experienced and novice breast        cancer educators working in the Hispanic/Latino community, providing        culturally-specific communication resources including tips, sample        talking points, breast cancer statistics, methods to address barriers to        care as well as overview videos in English and Spanish.

Educators can register in either English or Spanish at komentoolkits.org .
