
An online blogger, influenced by White Widow terror plotter Samantha Lewthwaite, is reportedly urging British woman to marry jihadi -fighters in Syria.

According to the Daily Star, using the name "Aishah" on social networking site Tumblr, the 20-year-old Muslim has picked up a cult -following since she started writing about her life six months ago.

An ardent fan of Osama bin Laden, the woman says that she got married two or three after her arrival in Syria and urged 40-plus single women in Britain to find a husband among Muslims fighting President Bashar al-Assad's regime.

In her posts, the woman particularly talks about the need for Muslims to renounce their self-indulgent lives in the West and join the Syrian uprising.

Aishah, who has boasted she is pals with fellow Brit female -jihadi Umm Layth, told followers they should waste no time in joining her in Syria, regardless of age or gender, the report said.
