
The new Autism Awareness license plates will be available online May 27th.Â  The license plate fee is $30.00 every two years in addition to the regular motor vehicle registration fee. The plate is available to the general public and there are no special requirements for acquiring the plate. A portion of the fees collected will be used to support the mission of the South Carolina Autism Society.

We wish to thank Mr. James Anderson of Spartanburg, Representative Donna Wood of Spartanburg, and the South Carolina General Assembly for their support in making the autism awareness plate a reality.
