Josefina's Artworks seem to be born together with the virtual space that surrounds them. They own the same inner vital energy of ancient pyramids, they are conveyors of  collective memories of humanity. The virtual walking is a process whereby some kind of magic takes place.  Watching it, you feel on a journey aimed at the unknowable. In the casual visualisation we can perceive an order that is given by the perfect harmony of the creations shaped by the Artist. She plays with the continuous force of opposition of the materials. On one side, stand the lightweight paper sculptures, which seem to be the transposition  of thoughts, or light and pure spirits of Nature. On the other side, in the heaviness of metal, she's able to gather the mystical force that gives to her sculptures the valence of ancient divine symbol. Unique pieces that  appear to be survived beyond centuries and unknown populations. The smaller creatures of nature becomes precious sculptures to adore. Her Artworks are a fusion of natural elements, manual skills and mental imagery, enabling  the creation of another elevated reality as she allows the object to evolve as it may. The spectator is so focused on the paintings that he seldom notices the different  between interior and exterior. Actually, it appears as a fluid passage as between one  dream and one other, and the sinuous gentleness of this passage let the imagination reach wonderful resources inside 3D.The sculptures remarkably enhance the three-dimensional environment: with their brightness and singular textures, become as touchable as reality. "This Virtual Exhibition is a confessional, a waking dream where  is possible both to view and experience the state of reality,  and, at the same time, it is something  coming from very deep inside minds".

Galerie Beckel Odille Boïcos and GV Art gallery, London present David Heathcote: Beyond Horizons David Heathcote (born 1931) is a contemporary English painter, whose work spans over 60 years. Today, he lives and works in Kent, though his art has led him to reside in Zimbabwe, and in Nigeria where he spent more than a decade. David trained at the Canterbury College of Art, and later at the Slade School in London, under Claude Rogers and Keith Vaughan. David's imagination as a painter was fired when he encountered Cubism at the Slade, and later by the African arts he encountered during his time as an art historian at Ahmadu Bello University, Nigeria. While in Nigeria David studied, photographed and collected the embroidered dress of the Hausa people on which he wrote his doctoral thesis. These rare, richly embroidered fabrics, which have also inspired his work, he has since donated to the British Museum. David's vivid, often highly abstracted painting explores the themes of construction, colour and space. The work is drawn from his memory and imagination rather than studies or directly from life. He says, 'For me, creativity is a journey where one is constantly meeting the unexpected, and there are always many challenges on the way to achieving the visual poetry I aspire to.' David has used a wide range of media in his work, from oil and acrylic paint, to collage, assemblage, clay and stone. His subject matter varies from delicately drawn bucolic landscapes of South England to Surrealist assemblage and collage and vividly patterned abstract canvases inspired by African light and fabrics. The variety of styles and themes in his oeuvre reflects his English roots (the Kent landscapes), his generation (the English Romantic and Surrealist styles of the 1940s) and his experience of living, teaching and studying in Africa in the 1960s and 1970s. His lasting love of France and his culture began with his first visit to Paris in 1948. Galerie Beckel Odille Boïcos is honoured to host David Heathcote's first exhibition in Paris following the major retrospective of his work held in London at GV Art in 2010. We most particularly hope that the French public but also the British and Commonwealth communities in Paris will have the opportunity of discovering the work of this uniquely poetic British artist.

"The Father Project" will consist of over thirty abstract works that reflect various positions on fatherhood from a father's perspective. Through several conversations and interviews with a diverse group of fathers Taylor developed a conceptual body of work inspired by their personal thoughts about fatherhood. Taylor was able to capture the true essence of these emotional stories and reveal the true energy of real life experiences while exercising the power of imagination.  This exhibit is a series of abstract art pieces created from the emotions, ideas, and thoughts of various men on fatherhood. Rather than focusing on the perspective of a son and his relationship with the parent this project explores the perspective of the father and his relationship with the child. Too often we hear about the negative stories and the impact broken relationships leave on children. The fact of the matter is that there are various reasons for failed results often times out of the father's control. It's time to hear the duality of those situations and be inspired by the fathers that are hands-on and sacrifice for the development of their families. Fatherhood is something that should be exhibited to the world from a positive perspective to inspire individuals to be and continue to be better parents. The process of analyzing ourselves is therapeutic and also allows us to understand others. This conceptual body of work is a collaboration of many life experiences that are an important part of the creative process. Welcome the The Father Project.
