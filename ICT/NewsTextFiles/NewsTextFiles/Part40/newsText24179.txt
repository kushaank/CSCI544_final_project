Alternattiva Demokratika chairperson Prof. Arnold Cassola has described public accountability and transparency in Malta as having become a grave concern.

“While the ombudsman has taken the initiative to investigate complaints with regards to promotions in the Army, Minister M<anuel Mallia is trying to stop him from doing so on the grounds that it is not the Ombudsman's remit to initiate the investigations.

Cassola also cited the refusals by energy minister Konrad Mizzi to refusing to publish the ElectroGas contract, and justice minister Owen Bonnici in blocking the publication of the Henley citizenship contract.

“Prime Minister Muscat has been negotiating secretly in Brussels to moor a gas tanker 12 kms away from Malta whilst telling us in Malta that this is impossible… we are witnessing a real attack on openness and transparency. Transparency and disclosure are the hallmarks of a vibrant democracy,” Cassola said.
