CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — A Dragon cargo ship owned by California-based Space Exploration Technologies ended a 28-day stay at the International Space Station yesterday, parachuting into the Pacific Ocean.

Space-station commander Steven Swanson used a robotic crane to release the Dragon capsule at 9:26 a.m. in orbit 266 miles above Earth.

About 5 1/2 hours later, the capsule splashed down about 300 miles west of Mexico’s Baja California peninsula.

The capsule, built and operated by the company commonly known as SpaceX, returned with 3,500 pounds of samples for analysis on Earth. Dragon is the only supply ship capable of returning items to Earth.
