
Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, patron in-chief of the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), has called upon the ‘real’ journalist community to get united to cope with the ongoing media war terming it as ‘madness’.

Bilawal wrote on Twitter on Monday that media houses were accusing one another of committing blasphemy just two weeks after the murder of Rashid Rehman, the lawyer and human rights activist representing a blasphemy accused in a Multan court.
