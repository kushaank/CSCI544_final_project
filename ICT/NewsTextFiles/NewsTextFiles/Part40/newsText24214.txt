
CACI International has won a $21 million task order to help the U.S. Army integrate data networking and connectivity tools for the branch’s tactical command infrastructure.

The potential two-year contract also covers research and development, prototyping, logistics, systems engineering and software support services, CACI said Monday .

The Army uses the battle command system to manage C4I operations (command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence) and to achieve interoperability with other U.S. and coalition members’ C4I systems.

“This work directly aligns with a key objective of our customer to develop new and emerging network interoperability technologies and apply them to the battlefield,” said  Ken Asbury , CACI’s president and CEO.

CACI booked the contract during the third quarter of the company’s 2014 fiscal year.
