
We not only thank our veterans for performing the highest call of duty by serving our country, but we also invite them to put their military skills to use in the civilian workforce by owning a travel franchise and making vacation dreams come true.

CruiseOne®, the nation’s leading home-based and military-friendly travel franchise as part of World Travel Holdings, celebrates Military Appreciation Month this May with the launch of its third annual Operation Vetrepreneur: Become Your Own General contest, which begins on Monday, May 19, 2014 and continues until Friday, Aug. 8, 2014. Five deserving U.S. veterans will each receive a CruiseOne home-based travel franchise , a total value of $63,500.

“We not only thank our veterans for performing the highest call of duty by serving our country, but we also invite them to put their military skills to use in the civilian workforce by owning a travel franchise and making vacation dreams come true,” said Debbie Fiorino, senior vice president of CruiseOne.

There will be three rounds of judging as part of this contest. First, candidates will participate in a phone interview with a CruiseOne franchise development specialist. Semi-finalists will be required to submit a franchise application, business plan, and resume, all of which will be scored by the CruiseOne executive team. Final candidates will be invited to participate in follow-up phone interviews before winners are selected.

Five grand prize winners will be announced in August 2014. Valued at $12,700, each grand prize includes a complimentary CruiseOne franchise with a waived $9,800 initial start-up fee and monthly service fees. The new recruits will report for active duty in October, when they participate in a week-long franchise training at CruiseOne’s state-of-the-art world headquarters in Fort Lauderdale. Winners will be reimbursed up to $500 for their travel and provided with complimentary accommodations during the training program. Once their training is completed, winners will be armed with all the tools and knowledge that they need to start up their own CruiseOne franchise.

A member of VetFran, CruiseOne offers many military veteran incentive programs including a 20 percent discount off the franchise fee and additional discounts for hiring former members of the U.S. military or active-duty military spouses as associates. The company aims to have 25 percent of its travel franchise system consist of veterans and their spouses by December 2014.

CruiseOne’s Vetrepreneur program will aid military veterans in finding work that will separate them from their past lives while still using the disciplinary skills they have acquired. This opportunity will enable military veterans to rise to success in the travel franchise industry while still granting them time to also relax and vacation anywhere in the world.
