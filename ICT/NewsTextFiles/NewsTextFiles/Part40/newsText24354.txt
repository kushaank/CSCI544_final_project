
KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia Airlines (MAS) clarified that it has not "abandoned" the families of the missing flight MH370's crewmembers who had sought legal help.

In a statement issued Monday, the carrier explained that certain crewmember's families had retained foreign lawyers to represent their interests.

"These foreign lawyers directed that MAS cease any further direct communication with their clients, and that MAS direct all further communications regarding these crew member families to them," it said.

MAS noted that it had been in contact with family members without legal representation via the family support centre, and had been providing them updates from the Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) and the Malaysian Government.

"MAS would like to reiterate that it will continue to offer the same assistance to all families of crew members, but communications with families represented by foreign lawyers will be through their appointed lawyers as directed," it added.

It was reported that the family members of seven Flight MH370 crew claimed that they had been "abandoned" by the carrier for seeking legal advice.

The plane with 239 people aboard including 12 crewmembers vanished on March 8 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
