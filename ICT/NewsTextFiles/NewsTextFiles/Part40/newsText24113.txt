
MEXICO CITY  Seven years passed before the world would hear that some adrenaline addicted speleologist divers and a team of international experts had discovered Naia, the oldest skeleton ever found on the continent and one which strengthens the hypothesis about the Siberian origin of the first Americans.

The historic find occurred in an underwater cave in the southeastern Mexican state of Quintana Roo, with scientists Alberto Nava Blank, Alejandro Alvarez and Franco Antonelli leading the way.

It all began in 2007 when the speleodivers set out to explore the La Virgen cenote (a deep natural well or sinkhole) in dives to different depths.

Each time they dived deeper through the tunnel until they reached a depth of 10 meters (33 feet) and 1,200 meters (3,000 feet) inside the cave, Mexican archaeologist Pilar Luna told Efe.

Upon reaching that depth there was no more ground to be seen under them, they were very surprised... because the bottom dropped away as if they were in an emptiness filled with water and in total darkness, something like outer space and for that reason they dubbed the place Black Hole, Luna said.

With their dive lights they studied the walls and came upon bones of very large animals, and at one point found... the skull and humerus of a girl 15 to 16 years old with a height of almost 1.5 meters (4 feet, 7 inches) who had been very thin, Luna said.

The explorers got in contact with Mexicos National Anthropology and History Institute, or INAH, and organized the Hoyo Negro Aquatic Archaeology project, Tulum, Quintana Roo, Luna said.
