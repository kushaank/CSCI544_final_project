
The Museum of Military Memorabilia at Naples Municipal Airport invites the public to celebrate Memorial Day, Monday, May 26, at the museum, which plans two special activities. The museum is located in the Commercial Airline Terminal at the south end of the airport along North Road.

The museum will open at 9 a.m. with extra displays in the airport terminal.

At 12:45 p.m., Ragnhild Sunde and her family will donate a U. S. Navy ship brass bell, which will be rung and put on display at the museum.

At 1 p.m., the three finalists in the Toastmaster Academy patriotic speech contest will speak on three categories: military/veterans/history, freedom/equality and human experiences. Each speech will last seven to 10 minutes.

The Museum of Military Memorabilia, founded in 2006, has collected more than 10,000 pieces with the goals of honoring the veterans who have and are protecting the cause of freedom, preserving artifacts associated with military history and creating a greater understanding of military conflicts among present and future generations. More than 13,000 people visited the 900-square-foot museum last year.
