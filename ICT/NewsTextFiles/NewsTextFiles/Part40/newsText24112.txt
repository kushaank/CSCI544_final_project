MEXICO CITY--Mexican stocks opened lower Monday, pulled down by shares of America Movil (AMX, AMX.MX) after AT&T said it will sell its stake in the Mexican telecommunications company.

The benchmark IPC index was recently down 0.8% at 41581 points on volume of 67.8 million shares worth 1.2 billion pesos ($93 million).

America Movil shares were down 4.1% at MXN12.68. AT&T, a long-time investor in America Movil, said it plans to unload the $6 billion stake to facilitate regulatory approval of its $49 billion purchase of DirecTV, which competes with America Movil in pay television in Latin America.

America Movil declined to comment on the decision late Sunday, or say whether it will buy back the stake.

Shares of broadcaster Televisa (TV, TLEVISA.MX), which is Mexico's biggest pay television provider, were up 0.4% at MXN86.98. DirecTV has a minority stake in Televisa's satellite TV service Sky Mexico.

The Mexican peso was little changed against the U.S. dollar, quoted in Mexico City at MXN12.9060, according to Infosel, compared with MXN12.9005 at the close Friday.
