
GROUDED: Thick Fog grounded four flights this morning and cancelled one at Hamilton International Airport.

Flights out of Hamilton Airport have been cancelled and delayed this morning as thick fog blankets the region.

The clear, cool and still weather has played havoc with scheduled departures over the past two days.

The 7.30am departure to Wellington has been cancelled and 8am flights to Wellington, Christchurch, Palmerston North and Auckland have been delayed for at least 45 minutes.

Yesterday the thick mist affected all flights from 7am and resulted in one cancelled flight and four on the ground ready to go when the fog cleared.

MetService spokesman John Law said conditions would remain grim in the Waikato until around 11am and the scenario is expected to play out today.

Thick fog shut down Hamilton International Airport twice in one week in June last year.
