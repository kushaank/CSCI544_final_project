
The CEO of Polish RPG specialists CD Projekt RED has been giving developers tips on how to make the most out of working with big publishers.

In running The Witcher devs Marcin Iwinski has gained plenty of experience in working with publishers, especially Atari and Bandai Namco and he warns other developers not to be meek and passive when working with the big boys.

Iwinksi went on, “You have to learn it, and then you can use external support when you know how it works. Because then you can judge what they’re doing. You won’t be buying their crap, or their lousy work, and you’ll be able to make a more fruitful, useful and meaningful cooperation. Don’t be like a sheep going out there: ‘Do everything for me.’ They don’t understand your game. You’re the passionate one. You’re the creator.

CD Projekt RED are currently working on The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt which is due out on PC, PS4 and Xbox One in February of 2015. They also have a new sci-fi RPG Cyberpunk 2077 on the way as well.
