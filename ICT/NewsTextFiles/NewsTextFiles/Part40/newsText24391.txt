
MANILA: A suspected explosives expert of the Al Qaeda-linked Abu Sayyaf extremists blamed for a series of bombings in restive Mindanao has been arrested, the military announced on Monday.

Captain Maria Rowena Muyuela, the spokesman of the military’s Western Mindanao Command (Westmincom) based in Zamboanga City, said the suspect, identified Nujir Ahidji alias Abu Jomar, did not resist when a team of soldiers and policemen arrested him based on orders by a regional court where he was facing various criminal charges.

Muyuela disclosed Ahidji went into hiding in a “barangay” (village) literally a stone’s throw away from the Westmincom’s regional headquarters in Zamboanga City.

As a result, Muyuela said security officials wanted to ascertain whether Ahidji was planning to make as his next target the Westmincom headquarters or was merely using the proximity of the military camp to conceal his presence in the area.

Muyuela added the raiding team confiscated from Ahidji blasting caps, electrical wirings, tapes and a cellular phone which explosives experts would usually use in producing remotely-detonated improvised bombs.

The arrest of Ahidji arose from the decision of the military and the police to renew their campaign against criminal elements and arrest members of the Abu Sayyaf who gained local and international notoriety through a spate of abductions involving foreigners and Filipinos.
