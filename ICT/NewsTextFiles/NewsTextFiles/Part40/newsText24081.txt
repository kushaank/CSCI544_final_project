In a primary race where few issues separate the candidates, money will predict the outcome.

Nine times out of 10, the candidate with the most money wins, and the Democratic gubernatorial primary in Pennsylvania is shaping up to be no exception. The question heading into Tuesday’s primary isn’t whether self-funded candidate Tom Wolf will win, but by how much.

Wolf’s spending advantage has proven particularly useful in a primary where few issues divide the candidates. Wolf’s TV ads left his rivals with little wiggle room to stake claims on voters, and heading into primary day they’re slated to suffer because of it. The most recent poll from Muhlenberg College gave Wolf a 23-percentage-point lead over Philadelphia-area Rep. Allyson Schwartz, while state Treasurer Rob McCord and former state Environmental Protection Secretary Katie McGinty trailed farther behind.

The only variance is that Wolf used his deep pockets to get his message out first, and more voters know who he is because of it. His money allowed him to hire top-tier Democratic consultants like the media firm Shorr Johnson Magnus, which produced ads for President Obama’s 2008 campaign and for Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s in 2013.

Singel, a Wolf supporter, highlighted one example: His candidate was the only one with ads running during the heavily watched Winter Olympics in February. “Wolf caught them right when they were just forming their opinions,” Singel said.
