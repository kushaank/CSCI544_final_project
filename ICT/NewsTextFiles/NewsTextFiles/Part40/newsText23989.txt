
Billionaire Lee Kun Hee, chairman of Samsung Electronics Co.

“All test results for chairman Lee Kun-hee showed he is stable,” the Samsung Medical Center said in a brief statement.

Lee, who has been spearheading  tens of Samsung Group affiliates since 1987, was hospitalized after he had a cardiac arrest on May 10 that left him unconscious.

A spokeswoman for Samsung Group declined to comment on whether Lee had regained consciousness, only confirming that prior to today’s move,  Lee had been under the hospital’s intensive care unit. The hospital wasn’t immediately reachable for more comment.

Since Lee became ill earlier this month, local media and industry observers have been closely tracking the health status of the tycoon, South Korea’s richest man, to see if this would bring about any rapid changes in leadership at Samsung Electronics, Korea’s biggest company by market capitalization.

Lee built Samsung Electronics, the flagship of South Korea’s largest conglomerate Samsung Group, into a global brand that sells everything from semiconductors to televisions and household appliances. Samsung is currently best known as the largest seller of mobile phones. While Lee is less involved in day-to-day operations at Samsung as it is currently run by three co-chief executives, he is believed to have a final say in key strategic decisions.
