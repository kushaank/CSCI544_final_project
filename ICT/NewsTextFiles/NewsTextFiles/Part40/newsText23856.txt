
The Association of Spanish Newspaper Publishers is pushing for new legislation set to be introduced to parliament that would prevent news aggregators from reproducing othersâ€™ content without payment, according to WAN-Ifra.

Under the new legislation, the original publisher will be compensated even for the reproduction of headlines and snippets of text. Written permission and a greater fee will be demanded if an aggregator wishes to reproduce the whole article.

If the law passes, it would be the first major ruling on aggregation.
