
MEXICO CITY May 19 (Reuters) - Mexico's national oil company Pemex plans to launch exports of extra light Olmeca crude to the Cressier refinery in Switzerland beginning in July, the company said in a statement on Monday.

Pemex will send Olmeca crude shipments of between 300,000 and 500,000 barrels each to the Cressier refinery over a six-month period, a Pemex official told Reuters.

The official did not say how many such shipments would be made over the six-month period.

The crude exports to Switzerland are part of Pemex's strategy of diversifying its export markets away from an increasingly self-sufficient United States, which has for decades been the destination for most of Mexico's crude oil shipments.
