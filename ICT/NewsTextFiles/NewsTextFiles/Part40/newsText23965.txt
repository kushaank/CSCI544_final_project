
SPRINGFIELD (WREX) - An administrator with the Illinois Department of Transportation has resigned in the midst of an investigation into his time at the agency.

IDOT spokesman Guy Tridgell said Monday Carmen Iacullo retired on April 30, right around the time Tridgell said the department turned over information on Iacullo's tenure to the Office of the Executive Inspector General. Tridgell declined to elaborate.

Iacullo served as assistant to the district engineer at the Schaumburg district office and made $113,000 last year.

Tridgell said the investigation is not connected to an IDOT scandal in which up to 200 people were hired without following rules against political hiring decisions. That incident is part of a federal lawsuit.
