
RIVERSIDE, Calif. – Charlotte Jennings, 311th Expeditionary Sustainment Command alcohol and drug control officer, conducted Unit Prevention Leader training on the March Air Reserve Base in Riverside May 4 through May 9.

The Army Drug Testing Program is a command program composed of the Soldier, the commander, the Unit Prevention Leader, the Army Substance Abuse Program staff, the Forensic Toxicology Drug Testing Laboratories, the Medical Review Officer and the Staff Judge Advocate.

The program’s intent is to deter Soldiers from abusing drugs, give commanders access to security, military fitness, good order and discipline of their commands and serve as a basis to take appropriate action, adverse or other with a Soldier based on a positive test result.

Nineteen personnel were trained over five days to learn the minimum and maximum testing rate, the proper way to take and label samples and how to ensure the samples are sent to the proper testing authority.

Smart Testing is defined as the process where biochemical testing is conducted in such a manner that it is not predictable to the testing population. Commanders must use an effective reliable random selection method to identify soldiers for testing.

“Once these leaders graduate from this training they are the Commander's Subject Matter Expert and expected to assist the commander with the program,” Jennings added.

In a classroom environment, the trainees were given instruction and also completed an online course. Once they passed an online exam, they were certified and given a UPL card.
