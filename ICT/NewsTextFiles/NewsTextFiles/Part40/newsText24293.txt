
A city is a relatively large and permanent settlement . Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town within general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative , legal , or historical status based on local law.

For example, in the U.S. state of Massachusetts an article of incorporation approved by the local state legislature distinguishes a city government from a town. In the United Kingdom and parts of the Commonwealth of Nations , a city is traditionally a settlement with a royal charter . Historically, in Europe, a city was understood to be an urban settlement with a cathedral .

Cities generally have complex systems for sanitation , utilities , land usage, housing , and transportation . The concentration of development greatly facilitates interaction between people and businesses , benefiting both parties in the process. A big city or metropolis usually has associated suburbs and exurbs . Such cities are usually associated with metropolitan areas and urban areas , creating numerous business commuters traveling to urban centers for employment . Once a city expands far enough to reach another city, this region can be deemed a conurbation or megalopolis .
