
A 12-year-old girl was located in Mexico and reunited with her mother five years after her father allegedly abducted her.

According to the New York Daily News , a tip led authorities to a remote mountainous area in Hidalgo, Mexico where they found Jodie Borchert’s daughter, Cara Cox.

The Daytona Beach News-Journal reported that after the discovery Cox’s father, Aaron Cox, was apprehended immediately and flown Miami. He will be extradited back to Volusia County.

On Saturday, the young girl was reunited with her mother, who posted a heartfelt message last week on Facebook about how much she missed her daughter.

Authorities said that the girl’s father used a court-ordered visit to allegedly abduct his daughter in 2009.

The U.S. Marshals Service team is continuing to investigate the case.
