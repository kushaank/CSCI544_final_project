
St. Louis, Missouri, May 19, 2014 – Healthcare workers throughout Greater St. Louis will be cleaning out their closets this month to give back to those in need. Today through May 31, healthcare uniform retailer, Life Uniform is holding a scrub trade-in event giving Greater St. Louis area customers the opportunity to donate clean, gently worn uniforms to The Salvation Army of St. Louis, which serves adults, families and children in the community, in need of rehabilitation, housing, help due to homelessness, and disaster relief. Scrubs & Beyond and Life Uniform locations in St. Louis, Creve Coeur, St. Peters, Kirkwood and Fairview Heights, Illinois will serve as a collection site for the donations. Customers receive 20% off any regular price scrub item as a thank you for the donation of a clean, gently worn scrub item.

The Salvation Army utilizes its Family Stores to sell donated goods and generate revenue to transform lives at its Adult Rehabilitation Centers, veterans affairs services, prison ministries, elderly services, hunger relief efforts, housing and homeless services, Christmas assistance, and youth camps and recreation.
