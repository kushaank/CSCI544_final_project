The media is invited to attend this event at the Vermont Welcome Center.We are welcoming all media outlets to these locations.

Troopers, Sheriffs, Municipal Police Officers and Motor Vehicle inspectors will participate in this kick-off event. Local and State dignitaries will be present to help support the efforts of law enforcement to encourage drivers and passengers to buckle up for Every Trip, Every Time-Day and Night. Following the kick-off on May 19 officers from throughout the state will be conducting saturation patrols and safety checkpoints to raise awareness for the need to use all of the safety equipment. But it starts with you, using your safety belt and making sure that child passenger car seats are installed properly.

The campaign will continue for two weeks. We hope that this good habit will last forever,
