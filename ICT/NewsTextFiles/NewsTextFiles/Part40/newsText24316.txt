A Catholic high school in Brooklyn that has doled out scholarships in the name of a fallen 9/11 fire captain since 2001 is set to close in June, and the man’s family — and state AG’s office — want to know what’s happening to the fund’s leftover money.

“It’s heartbreaking,” Cathy Brunton, the widow of FDNY Capt. Vincent Brunton, told The Post.

“I understand the school is closing, and I’m sad for that, but all the people in the neighborhood gave up blood, sweat and tears to give money in [Vincent’s] name for the scholarship fund.

Over the years, the Captain Vincent Brunton Scholarship Fund has given eight full or partial scholarships to students to cover the $9,000 annual tuition at Bishop Ford HS in Windsor Terrace, sources said.

Vincent and his two brothers graduated from the school.

Among those seeking answers is state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, whose office is looking into the fund, according to a source.

A spokeswoman for the Brooklyn archdiocese said the archdiocese has no control over the fund.

After The Post made inquiries, Bishop Ford’s financial officer, Victor Gomez, said the account has $25,000 left over and that the school would reach out to Cathy Brunton and other scholarship-fund members to see what they would like to do with the money.

The Yankees are leading the Angels 6-5 in the ninth, but Mariano Rivera blows the save. Leave it to Jeter, who hits a walk-off single in the ninth inning for a 7-6 Yankees win.
