
PAYSON — A dance battle featuring new cars, fresh beats and 1980s throwback ensembles will get your toes tapping, and it was all filmed in Utah.

Scott Winn is a filmmaker and composer, and he tries to find a way to blend both interests. His videos are often music-driven, focusing on dance. After seeing some of his other creative videos , Ford reached out to Winn and asked him to make something featuring the 2015 Ford Mustang.

The video features a "guys vs. girls" aerobic dance battle. For an additional layer of fun, the rhythms and hairstyles are undeniably 1980s — complete with bright blue eyeshadow, thick mustaches and big hair.

One of the most addicting video games comes to life with one man's  destiny.

Shot primarily on Main Street in Payson, Winn worked with Jason Celaya to choreograph the bright, snappy video. Through casting and auditions, they found the exuberant dancers featured in the video, and each dancer is local.

The original song, “Shimmy Fallon,” is available on iTunes . And you can stage your own dance battle with your friends, using Celaya’s tutorial to perfect the choreography.
