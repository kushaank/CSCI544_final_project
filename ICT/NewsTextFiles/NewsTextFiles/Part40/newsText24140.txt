Drawing inspiration from the likes of expressionist artist Jose Orozco to Renaissance painter Sandro Botticelli, Coronel’s artworks flirt between elegant beauty and subtle darkness — the subjects of his portraits occupy a gloomy yet serene existence. Armed with an observant eye for detail, the artist seeks to unravel the psychological underpinnings of the human psyche through his paintings.

The product of the contemporary sensibilities met with past imaginations, the paintings of Dominguez that span over three decades reveal classical creations seen through a contemporary vision.
