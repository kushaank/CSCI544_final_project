The unit had been deployed for nearly a year as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, according to a news release. While deployed, the unit was headquartered in Kandahar, Afghanistan, and provided strategic and tactical communication to more than 30,000 people throughout the operation. Bravo Company worked across 20 different locations in Afghanistan, completing signal missions, managing technical control facilities and supporting radio and video operations.

The unit is stationed out of Hodges, S.C., but the soldiers are members of communities from around the state.

The Freedom Salute campaign is one of the largest Army National Guard welcome-home endeavors in history, the release states. It is designed to publicly recognize the sacrifice of guardsmen and women and those who supported them during their deployment.
