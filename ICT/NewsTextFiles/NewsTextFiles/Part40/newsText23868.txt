
LAS CRUCES &GT;&GT; Magistrate Court Judge Richard Wellborn of Las Cruces was back on the bench Monday following an absence of more than two weeks that he said he was not allowed to discuss.

"I am on the bench, back working. I was off for 16 days," Wellborn said Monday during a meeting with the Sun-News editorial board and Norman Osborne, his opponent in the Democratic primary election for the judgeship in Magistrate Court Division 4.

Wellborn said he's aware of the speculation that has taken place since his absence from the bench, but that he is unable to address it.

"I've certainly read the stories, and there has been interest in it, and understandably so. Certainly, there's speculation and some rumors as well that, truly, I'd like to be able to address," he said. "But the bottom line is these matters are confidential court matters, and I simply cannot. Those restrictions apply not just to me and the other judges but to the court staff and the judiciary in general.

"So, I certainly hope that people, and the newspaper particularly, don't hold it against me, or any of us, for not being able to discuss it. We're just carefully observing the confidentiality agreements and we're all going to have to be stuck with it."

Asked if his return to the bench means the matter has been settled, Wellborn said that it did. He said, because of court rules, he could not confirm or deny if a report had been filed by the Judicial Standards Commission.

Early voting is underway in the race between Wellborn, who was appointed to the bench in October by Gov. Susana Martinez, and Osborne. Wellborn said he hoped voters would follow the same instructions he gives to jurors and not speculate about evidence they don't have in making their decisions.
