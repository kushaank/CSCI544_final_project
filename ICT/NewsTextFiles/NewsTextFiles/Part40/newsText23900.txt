
PRAGUE, Czech Republic (May 19, 2014) — Czech tire maker Mitas a.s. is entering the world of tractor pulling, agreeing to sponsor the European Tractor Pulling Committee (ETPC) and rolling out a prototype of a Mitas Powerpull tire.

The prototype of the tractor-pulling tire is based on a manufacturing process similar to Mitas’ high-horsepower tractor tires, the Prague-based specialty tire maker said. Commercially viable versions should be available this year.

Mitas said it cured the first testing prototypes of the Powerpull tire in April at its new factory in Otrokovice, Czech Republic.

The tire maker said tractor-pulling was a logical outgrowth of its growing production of agricultural tires. Under the sponsorship agreement, the Mitas brand and products will be promoted during international ETPC tractor-pulling events. Financial terms of the sponsorship were not disclosed.

There are 11 ETPC Eurocup events scheduled this year in seven European countries. The first ETPC Eurocup race will take place May 16 in Lidköping, Sweden.

A Mitas spokesman said the company expects the Powerpull will be commercially available in the Americas as well later this year. He also noted Mitas’ “All or Nothing” tractor-pulling team competed earlier this year at the National Farm Machinery Show in Louisville, Ky.
