
MIAMI (WSVN) -- A South Florida church forged ahead with Sunday services, two days after thieves ransacked the house of worship and took off with thousands of dollars worth of media equipment, said officials.

Music and prayer were in full swing Sunday at Friendship Missionary Baptist Church, located along Northwest Seventh Avenue and 58th Street in Miami, but Pastor Gaston Smith said staff and congregants alike felt violated after discovering the property had been ransacked. "We arrived Friday morning at around 7 o'clock to discover that somebody had burglarized the church and broken into our building and realized they'd stolen about $30,000-plus of media equipment," he said.

Smith said the culprits used crowbars to break through a fire door. "Right in this area, here, this was damaged," he said as he pointed at the spot where the perpetrators used the crowbar. "It was all sealed as a fire door, and they came in, and they spent some time destroying that, and you can see we kind of had to reinforce the doors now from the inside," he said.

The pastor pointed out the suspects' fingerprints on the church's bus, something he said was done during their escape. "You can see where they had their hands here smeared, some bloodstains there the police got where they evidently got on the bucket and handed the items over," he said.

Smith said he has a message for whoever targeted his church. "Our people are determined regardless of what the enemy tries to do," he said. "We're determined to still praise God, still have service to the community."

Police officers were able to recover some of the stolen items. The suspects remain at large.

If you have any information on this burglary, call Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-TIPS. Remember, you can always remain anonymous, and you may be eligible for a reward.
