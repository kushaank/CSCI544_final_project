
A coast guard patrol in the early hours of Monday intercepted a rubber dinghy carrying 30 undocumented migrants who were trying to land on the southeastern Aegean island of Samos.

The passengers had to be rescued after they tore a hole in the vessel and it started sinking.

They are being held at the islandÂ’s main town, Pythagoreio.
