
Yemen recently launched an offensive against suspected Al-Qaeda elements in the southern regions, where the group continues to stage sporadic attacks on army and police targets.

Two Yemeni soldiers were killed on Monday in an ambush by militants in the southern province of Hadhramaut, a security source said.

"Militants believed to be affiliated with Al-Qaeda targeted a military patrol in Al-Shahr city, killing two soldiers," the source, who asked not to be named, told Anadolu Agency.

Army troops are currently combing areas near to the attack site for the assailants, he said, giving no further details.

Yemen recently launched an offensive against suspected Al-Qaeda elements in the southern regions, where the group continues to stage sporadic attacks on army and police targets.

Dozens of people were killed in intensified fighting between rebels and army troops in recent weeks.

Yemen has been dogged by turmoil since revolutionary protests in 2011 forced autocratic president Ali Abdullah Saleh to step down after 33 years in power.

In the three years since, authorities have struggled to restore law and order.
