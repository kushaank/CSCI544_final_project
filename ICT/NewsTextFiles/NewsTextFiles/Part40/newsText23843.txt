
The successful efforts of incumbent agencies Big Communications and Total Media will see them lose Motorcorp brands Land Rover and Jaguar.

Due to global alignment, Y&R will release new work for the car brands from August.

Jaguar Land Rover NZ general manager James Yates says significant growth in New Zealand sales means the brands needed to align with a global agency partner.

“We greatly respect Big and Total. Ironically it’s partly thanks to their great work that we find ourselves in this position," he says.

Mr Yates says the combined Jaguar Land Rover business has almost doubled in two years.

The Motorcorp division has also appointed former Jack Daniel’s brand manager James McKee as marketing manager.

Campbell & Co retains the PR account for both brands, while other Motorcorp brands Volvo and Renault stick with current agency Federation.
