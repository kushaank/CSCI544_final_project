
LAHORE- Federal Minister for Railways Khawaja Saad Rafique has said that the rigging claim made by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan was a childish behavior.

Speaking to media after touring railway engine shed in Lahore, Khawaja Saad Rafique said "the decisions of electoral rigging should be done in the courts rather than on D-Chowk".Â  "Lesson of democracy should be learnt from India," said Saad Rafique. The railways minister further said that the railways sector had asked for Rs42.7 billion in the upcoming budget but the Finance Ministry had agreed to allocate Rs31 billion in the next budget which was not enough to keep the sector going. He said that the labour could only earn if the sector was working.
