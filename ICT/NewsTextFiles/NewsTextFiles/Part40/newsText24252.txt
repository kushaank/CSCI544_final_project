ATLANTIC BEACH, Fla. (AP) - United States Coast Guard crews have stopped searching for a man who was seen struggling in the water near the Daytona Beach Pier.

The Coast Guard says their search ended Monday afternoon. The Volusia County Sheriff's Office contacted the Coast Guard Sunday evening after a lifeguard reported seeing the man in the water about 300 yards offshore in front of the Hilton Daytona Beach Resort.

Coast Guard crews joined the sheriff's office and Volusia County Beach Safety officials in the search.

The Coast Guard says there are currently no reports of missing swimmers in the Daytona Beach area.

The identity of the swimmer remains unknown.
