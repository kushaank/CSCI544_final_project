ZAMBIA Air Force (ZAF) Deputy Commander Muliokela Muliokela and a Brian Mweene have died in a plane crash west of Lusaka.

Major General Muliokela and Colonel Mweene died when a ZAF SAAB MFI-15 trainer aircraft the deputy commander was flying crashed on a farm yesterday.

Minister of Defence Edgar Lungu said during a press briefing that the two were on a routine training exercise.

“I wish to confirm that the two crew members died. Investigations have since been instituted to establish the cause of the accident,” Mr Lungu said.

The minister said the plane crashed near Westwood area.

And according to eyewitnesses, the crash, which happened around 13:00 hours at York Farm near Nampundwe turn-off, attracted scores of residents who rushed to the scene with the hope of rescuing the victims.

Soon after the crash, farm workers rushed to the scene while passers-by and residents jumped over an electric wire-fence and others cut it to gain access to the accident scene.

A Daily Mail crew that rushed to the scene found armed ZAF officers had cordoned the area.  Scores of residents, who wanted to take a glimpse of the disintegrated plane, were kept at bay.

The officers also ordered journalists from the Daily Mail, Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation and Muvi Television not to take any photos of the accident scene.

After pushing journalists back to about 300 metres away, a military Toyota Land Cruiser was driven into thick bushes where the plane had crashed to carry the bodies.
