
JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran's adult children say they're shocked someone apparently tried to use their mother's debilitating dementia for political purposes as their father seeks re-election in Mississippi.

Conservative blogger Clayton Thomas Kelly was arrested Friday and charged with exploiting a vulnerable adult. Authorities say he photographed a bedridden Rose Cochran in a nursing home and posted the photo online as part of an anti-Cochran video.

Cochran's children, Clayton and Kate Cochran, said Monday their mother has lived at the nursing home for 13 years. They say they have been amazed to see how devoted their dad has been as their mother progressed from early dementia, to complete loss of language to her current state of hospice care.

Cochran faces state Sen. Chris McDaniel in a GOP primary June 3.
