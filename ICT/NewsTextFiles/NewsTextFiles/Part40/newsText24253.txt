
Greta Van Susteren went to Mexico to speak to the mother of jailed U.S. Marine Andrew Tahmooressi, who has been held in prison since April 1 on firearms charges.

Tahmooressi says he took a wrong turn in San Diego, Calif., ending up at the border of Mexico. That’s when border guards searched his car and found three guns that were legally purchased in the United States.

His mother Jill Tahmooressi went “On The Record,” where she discussed seeing her son for the first time since April 14. He was recently relocated from La Mesa Penitentiary in Tijuana, where Jill said he feared for his life, to El Hongo II State Penitentiary.

Jill said the new facility is much improved, and Andrew is being held in solitary confinement. She said portions are scant, so he’s always hungry, but authorities would not let her bring food into the prison for him. They did let her bring him a second pair of pants and two books, she said.

“He just needs to stay alive so that he can eventually have freedom,” Jill told Van Susteren.

“He's not a criminal, he made a mistake and made a wrong turn,” she said. Jill urged Americans to sign a WhiteHouse.gov petition that the White House must respond to if it gets 100,000 signatures this month.
