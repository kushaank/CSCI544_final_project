
A woman is hospitalized in stable condition after being attacked by a brown bear on an Anchorage military base.

Maj. Angela Webb tells The Associated Press that the woman was jogging with her husband Sunday when they became separated.

The woman suddenly came across the female bear with two cubs. The bear and jogger startled each other.

Webb says the bear went into a defensive posture. Webb says from differing accounts, the woman either played dead or was knocked unconscious when the bear swiped at her.

She suffered lacerations to her neck, arms and legs. A passer-by picked her up and took her to the base hospital before she was transferred to the Alaska Native Medical Center.

The victim has asked that her identity not be released.
