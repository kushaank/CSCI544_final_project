
Whoever is responsible for Saturday’s shooting in Vardanants Street in Yerevan must be punished in all strictness of the law, secretary of the Prosperous Armenia Party’s (PAP) parliamentary faction Naira Zohrabyan, speaking on behalf of the party, said.

She thus responded to allegations that a relative of a senior PAP member may have been the one who shot and wounded five people in broad daylight in the territory of Yerevan’s flea market known as Vernissage.

All the five people who suffered in the incident were transported to hospital with gunshot wounds in the legs. All underwent surgeries.

The police instituted a criminal case on the hallmarks of illegal gun possession and an act of hooliganism committed with the use of firearms.

According to an unofficial version of the evens, the shooting took place over a parking space argument. The identity of the shooter has not been officially revealed yet. According to media reports, however, Gor Arakelyan, a son-in-law of PAP lawmaker Karo Karapetyan, turned himself in to police on Sunday, also surrendering his Makarov pistol.
