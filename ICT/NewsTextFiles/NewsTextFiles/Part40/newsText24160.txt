
In a meeting with visiting bishops from the Mexican Episcopal Conference on Monday morning, Pope Francis lamented the “many forms of violence that afflict Mexican society, especially the young,” and went on to make explicit mention of clandestine migration and violence stemming from drug trafficking, according to La Jornada . “Drugs are a problem that [Mexicans] are suffering from in a serious way. When a peasant tells you, ‘What do you want me to do? If I grow corn I live for a month, if I grow ‘opium’ I live for a year.’ You all must always be with the people.  It’s the only recommendation that I will make to you and it comes from the heart,” he said.
