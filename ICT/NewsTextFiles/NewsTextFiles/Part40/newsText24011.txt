
A Telecom hardware failure that left many customers without access to call centres, its website, and other commercial resources has now been fixed.

A Telecom spokesperson said a fault in a piece of equipment in the Auckland data centre meant that customer support channels were down for most of the day.

Prepaid customers have not been able to top up their mobile phone credit as the fault coincided with a planned upgrade of the Telecom prepaid network.

Customer support services were restored this afternoon and the prepaid mobile system was due to be upgraded overnight.

During today's outage, calling, text, mobile data and most broadband services have continued as normal.

Telecom has rostered extra call centre staff on this evening to assist with any backlog in customer support needs.
