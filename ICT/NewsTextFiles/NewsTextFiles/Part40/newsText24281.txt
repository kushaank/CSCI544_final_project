A guard looks over the Joint Task Force Guantanamo detention facility. For the first time a U.S. District Court judge has ruled on the treatment of detainees. A ruling Wednesday could lead to a permanent ban on the forced feeding of hunger strikers, and a new round of litigation regarding the treatment of the 154 men imprisoned at Guantanamo.

WKSU’s Jeff St.Clair reports, one Northeast Ohio lawyer will be closely watching the proceedings.

Carlos Warner is a federal public defender based in Akron. In 2008, he was assigned to defend 13 Guantanamo detainees.

Last year some of his clients joined a wide-spread hunger strike at the high security facility.

Military officials have been force feeding the more than a dozen remaining hunger-strikers, a practice a federal judge temporary halted on Friday.

Warner says it’s the first time a US court has ruled on practices inside Guantanamo.

The judge also ordered the military to retain video tapes of the procedures.  Warner says the tapes, and a permanent ban on force feeding could lead to a review of conditions at Guantanamo.

Pentagon officials say they are abiding by the judge’s temporary order.
