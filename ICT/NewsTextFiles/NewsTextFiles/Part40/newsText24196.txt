
A senior Iranian military commander said the Islamic Republic will soon unveil an indigenous radar system, which is capable of detecting stealth aircraft.

“A radar system special to detecting stealth aircraft, which has been developed by young and specialist [Iranian] forces despite conditions caused by [US-engineered] sanctions, will be used to counter stealth aircraft,” Commander of Khatam al-Anbiya Air Defense Base Brigadier General Farzad Esmaili said on Saturday.

Last December, Iran unveiled an indigenously designed and manufactured radar system named Arash.
