
At least nine serving Generals in the Nigerian Army and other senior military officers are currently being investigated for allegedly supplying arms to members of the Boko Haram sect.

According to a report by Nigerian Pilot newspaper, the Nigerian military authorities would soon unveil the affected officers to the general public as soon as it concludes its internal checks.

However, it was gathered that their arraignment was only being delayed at the moment because of the current battle to free the abducted Chibok schoolgirls.

The paper quoted a source who said that some detained Boko Haram suspects allegedly named the Generals and other military officers as part of those supplying arms to the group.

An insider disclosed that the Nigerian Army, headed by the Chief of Army Staff, Lt-Gen. Kenneth Minimah, alongside other top military officers were working tirelessly to sanitise the armed forces and fish out collaborators with insurgents.

He hinted that the Army Chief had been briefed on the Generals’ arms deals with the insurgents, adding that “he (Army Chief) is currently carrying out a secret and independent investigation on the matter”.

In a quick reaction, the Defence Headquarters described the allegations as grave and promised to investigate the claims.

The outcome of the probe as well as the names of those involved in the act is yet to be made public by the authorities.
