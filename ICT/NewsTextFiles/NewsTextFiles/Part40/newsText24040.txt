
Major streets in Jeddah will have footbridges constructed over them.

Jeddah Municipality plans to build ten footbridges in the city at a cost of $15.2mn following advice from Jeddah Traffic Department on pedestrian safety, a spokesman for the city’s mayoralty has revealed.

Muhammad Al-Baqmi told Arab News that the department suggested building three footbridges over Sabaeen Street, four over Palestine Street and three over King’s Road after traffic lights were removed from the streets.

“We expect the bridges to be operational by the middle of next year. They will be in addition to the existing 70 footbridges or so built around the city,” he said.

Brig. Gen. Zaid Al-Hamzi, spokesman for Jeddah Traffic Department, said that the department is very concerned about the frequency of vehicle collisions with pedestrians due to the lack of footbridges on many major streets in the city.

“We have witnessed more than 60 cases where people were run over by vehicles during the last couple of months. There were 20 incidents on Palestine Street and another 20 on Sabaeen Street. In addition, there were 10 accidents on King’s Road, and 10 more on Al-Andalus Street. Passengers should be very careful when crossing streets,” said Al-Hamzi.

A number of Jeddah citizens called on the authorities, like the mayoralty and traffic department, to build footbridges for crossing roads safely, especially on roads that experience heavy traffic.
