
The target of the gunfire, coming from anti-aircraft weapons and rocket propelled grenades, was not immediately clear, Reuters reported.

Local television station Al-Nabaa said clashes had erupted in the south of the capital, without giving details.

The gunfire came after more than 70 people were killed on Friday in clashes between irregular army forces and militants in Benghazi, the main city in the volatile East.
