The list of airmen selected for promotion to master sergeant is expected to be released Thursday, the Air Force Personnel Center said.

Last year, 3,841 technical sergeants were selected for promotion  an 18.71 percent selection rate. That was the lowest selection rate in more than a decade, and the number of selectees last year was far below the 6,618 picked for promotion in 2011.

It is likely this years selection rate will also be low. The Air Force continues to face high retention, while trying to cut its ranks by thousands through a broad force management program.

Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in a May 13 interview with Air Force Times that competition for promotions is bound to get tougher as the service shrinks.

By the numbers, its going to be increasingly more selective and more competitive in the promotion system overall, James said.
