Albuquerque will lose 11 Southwest Airlines flights a day beginning in November as a result of schedule changes, Southwest said Monday.

The number of flights in and out of the Albuquerque International Sunport will decrease to 34 in November from 45 today, Southwest said.

The airline said it is not dropping any of its regular destinations to and from the Sunport.

According to information provided by Southwest, between May and November, the airline will cut one flight to Baltimore, three flights to Dallas, two flights to Phoenix, two flights to Seattle, two flights to Las Vegas, and one to San Diego. When those flights end, there will be no direct Southwest flights between Albuquerque and Seattle.

Sunport spokesman Daniel Jiron said six of those lost flights are seasonal and five are long-term reductions. He added that the reductions were not as great as had been expected.

â€œA lot of people were expecting worse. We do see a reduction in frequency but no destination losses,â€� Jiron said. â€œRecently we have landed two airlines â€“ Jet Blue and Alaska Airlinesâ€� and the airport is always looking to line up more airlines.

In the busy summer months, the Sunport has about 90 departures a day, Jiron added.

Since 2008, the Sunport has seen a 24 percent decrease in the number of inbound and outbound passengers, Jiron said. In 2008, 6.7 million passengers went through the airport. In 2013, that had fallen to 5.1 million.

â€œMedium hub airports like Albuquerque have suffered greatly over the past few years, one reason is the economy,â€� and the other is that airlines are moving away from medium hub airports to more profitable routes, Jiron added.
