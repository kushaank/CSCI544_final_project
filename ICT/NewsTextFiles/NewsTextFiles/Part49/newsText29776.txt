
More than 3,000 Chinese have already returned home from Vietnam, reports said at the weekend, and according to the Global Times newspaper another 4,000 were to be evacuated.

Two Chinese vessels arrived in Vietnam's Ha Tinh province on Monday morning and will sail back to China in the evening, the Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily said on a verified Twitter account.

The official news agency Xinhua named them as the Wuzhishan and Tongguling and said they had arrived at the port of Vung Ang.

China said on Sunday it was dispatching five ships to bring home nationals.

Vietnamese authorities responded on Sunday by dispatching hundreds of security personnel to quell the violence, and more than 300 suspected perpetrators are being prosecuted, officials said.

China's foreign ministry, meanwhile, announced Sunday that it has suspended some bilateral exchange programmes and issued a new appeal for Chinese citizens to avoid travelling to Vietnam.

"China will consider taking further steps depending on how the situation plays out."

Several major Chinese travel agencies have suspend their Vietnam tour services, Xinhua reported.
