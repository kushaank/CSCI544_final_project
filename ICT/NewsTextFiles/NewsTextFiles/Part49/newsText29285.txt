
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder (L) speaks as he announces indictments against Chinese military hackers on cyber-espionage as U.S. Attorney for Western District of Pennsylvania David Hickton (R) listens May 19, 2014 at the Department of Justice in Washington, DC. A grand jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania have indicted five Chinese military hackers for computer hacking, economic espionage and other offense directed at six American victim in the U.S. nuclear power, metals and solar products industries.

The Department of Justice announced today that five Chinese military officers have been indicted for allegedly hacking trade secrets from U.S companies.

It’s the first time that the U.S. has charged specific foreign officials with cyber espionage, but as Marketplace's China correspondent Rob Schmitz tells us, it’s actually sort of old news.

Schmitz says China probably wants the trade secrets to help build up its infrastructure. The hacking allegedly took place three or four years ago, when China had just announced plans to build dozens of nuclear power plants across the country.

Schmitz says hacking is a growing problem for U.S. companies, but that doesn’t mean they’ll abandon their operations in China.
