
  The Shiv Sena, which is now the second largest constituent of the National Democratic Alliance, may not influence the choice of Cabinet portfolios and may leave the decision to Narendra Modi.

 According to a top Sena leader, party chief Uddhav Thackeray will stick to the stand taken by his father, the late Bal Thackeray, during the first NDA government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 1998.

 “Vajpayeeji had asked Balasaheb to choose his Ministry. But he demurred, saying their alliance was based on Hindutva and not aimed at securing Cabinet berths. He asked Vajpayeeji himself to decide on the ministries to be given to the Sena,” the Sena leader said on condition of anonymity.

 Mr. Uddhav Thackeray will travel to Delhi for attending the NDA’s meeting on Tuesday where allocation of ministries is likely to be discussed. He is likely to have a meeting with Mr. Modi.
