
A HAWAIIAN surfer who allegedly ploughed her car into a 73-year-old woman in a fit of road rage has been charged with attempted murder.

Jill Anjuli Hansen, 30, allegedly followed Elizabeth Conklin through an apartment carpark and waited for her to get out of the car before driving into the elderly woman on Wednesday.

Hawaii News Now reported that apartment employee Chris Khory saw Hansen reverse her car to hit Conklin again.

But before she could, he grabbed a crowbar and smashed the rear windshield of Hansen’s Volkswagen Passat, causing her to jump out her car and run away.

Hansen, a self-described model and professional surfer, was later arrested.

Conklin, who suffered major bruising, said she owed her life to the bystander who fended off her attacker.

“He saw her in her car getting ready to hit me again. He totally saved my life,” Conklin told ABC News.

Conklin, who was rushed to a hospital in Honolulu for treatment, said she believes her attacker wanted to steal her car.

Police have not established a motive.

Hansen, meanwhile, has a history of police contact.

She has a pending assault case and in a separate case was ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation.

There is also an active restraining order filed by her father.

According to the court documents, her father says she used Facebook to find someone to murder him and his family.
