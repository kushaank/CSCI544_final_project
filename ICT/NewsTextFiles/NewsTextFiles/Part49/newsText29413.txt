
The police commissioner in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire resigned on Monday, but still refuses to apologize for calling President Barack Obama a racial slur.

In a short and succinct email sent to police commission chairman Joseph Balboni, Robert Copeland simply wrote, "Dear Commission Chairman Balboni, I resign," reports CNN .

The situation first began when resident Jane O'Toole overheard Copeland in a restaurant loudly call Obama the n-word. She then contacted the town manager about what she heard.

At a town meeting, residents of Wolfeboro called on the 82-year-old to resign, while he sat silently in the room. The small town has a population of 6,300 and only 20 residents are African-Americans.

Copeland later sent an email to O'Toole and the other two members of the police commission and admitted to saying the slur, but refused to apologize. "I believe I did use the 'N' word in reference to the current occupant of the Whitehouse (sic)," he said. "For this, I do not apologize - he meets and exceeds my criteria for such."
