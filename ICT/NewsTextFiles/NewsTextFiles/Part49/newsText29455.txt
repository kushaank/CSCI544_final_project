Mitt Romney said a New Hampshire police commissioner who admittedly used the N-word in reference to President Obama ought to resign and say he’s sorry.

The police commissioner, Robert Copeland, 82, serves in Wolfeboro, where Mr. Romney and his family have a home.

Last week, Mr. Copeland stood defiant over his use of the term and refused to apologize during a town meeting.

He had previously confirmed in an email to other police commissioners that he used the epithet in reference to Mr. Obama earlier this year. His confirmation came after a Wolfeboro resident complained about Mr. Copeland’s use of the word in March to the town manager. She said in her complaint that she overheard Mr. Copeland speaking loudly at a local restaurant, Politico reported.
