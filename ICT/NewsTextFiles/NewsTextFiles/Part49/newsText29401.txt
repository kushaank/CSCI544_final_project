
The Prime Minister-elect tweeted his gratitude to the heads of state and government and other dignitaries since yesterday.

“In our conversation, @BarackObama & I talked about further strengthening India-USA strategic partnership that will help both nations,” he said in a tweet.  Obama had a few days ago called up Modi to congratulate him over his victory.

Modi has had an uneasy relationship with the US which denied him a visa in 2005 over 2002 Gujarat riots. He has, however, in his public utterances stressed that foreign relations cannot be “influenced” by incidents related to individuals.
