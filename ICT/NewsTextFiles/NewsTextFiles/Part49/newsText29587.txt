
Congratulations!

Your weather is set to . You can change the location at any time.

Good morning, Multnomah County. Here's a look at what to expect in the week ahead.

First off, Monday could be an historic (and busy) one at the Multnomah County building . Judge Michael McShane is expected to strike down Oregon's ban on gay marriage during a noon ruling in Salem. If he does, Multnomah County officials are prepared to begin issuing marriage licenses to gay couples.

Tuesday is Election Day. If you haven't dropped off or mailed in your ballot yet, now is the time. It's too late to mail your ballot, so make sure you get to a drop box by 8 p.m. Tuesday evening to rock the vote. My colleagues and I will be in the newsroom and on the election night party circuit Tuesday night, bringing you the results of every race , starting at 8 p.m.

With less than two weeks to go before the Multnomah County Board of Commissioners votes upon next year's county budget, you've got one more opportunity to speak your mind about how you think the county should spend its money. The commissioners will hold a public hearing on the budget at 9 a.m. on Thursday.

On Thursday, board members will convene in their weekly voting meeting to decide whether to sell "Edgefield North," also known as the county pig farm, to Michael McMenamin of the eponymous hotel chain. Eric Apalategui has the full story on the county's plan to sell.

My Portland!
