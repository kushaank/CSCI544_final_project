
(WJLA) - Isaac Rana is among those more than eager to see the engineer’s report when it comes to the collapsed slope in his neighborhood of Fort Washington. His mother’s home literally hands in the balance.

“We're just waiting to see really, not so much we can do..." he says.

"It'll give us the direction, it'll give the residents the direction we need to take going forward," said Ronnie Gill, Director at the Office of Emergency Management in P.G. County.

At this point, county officials are not making the results public. The plan of action is still unknown, but the last time a slope failed in the county, claiming portions of these houses along Yorkville Road, nothing could be done.

In May 2008, this slope failed. It dropped 10 feet because of the underlying Marlboro clay -- the same reason for the collapse in Fort Washington now. The ground couldn't be stabilized, and eventually, the county bought the houses and tore them down.

"It's been hard...we just have to stick together."
