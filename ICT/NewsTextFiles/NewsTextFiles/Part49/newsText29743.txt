
Vatican City, May 19 - The Vatican’s Financial Information Authority (AIF) on Monday said reports of suspicious transactions rose from six in 2012 to 202 just one year later in 2013.      Five of the reports were forwarded to justice authorities for further investigation.      The AIF explained the increase on greater vigilance.      The increase "reflects both the development of the appropriate legal framework and a substantial improvement in the operating performance of the entities" under AIF supervision, it said in its 2013 annual report, which was released Monday.      The AIF also said the number of requests for the exchange of financial information with authorities abroad also increased substantially, thanks to the conclusion of a series of bilateral accords.       Pope Francis has been overseeing the Holy See's efforts to get the scandal-plagued Vatican Bank onto the white list of bodies with top credentials against money laundering.      The drive is part of wider reforms Francis is gently pushing.      The AIF was first established by former pope Benedict in 2011 to fight money laundering.
