
A Michigan suburb is issuing tickets to people who swear near certain public areas in a crackdown on disorderly conduct.

One 19-year-old said he was fined $200 for swearing near a playground. After his friend was ticketed for skateboarding in downtown Brighton, Colin Andersen said, “This is f—ing bulls–t.” Though he claims no children heard him swear under his breath, a police officer who did hear gave Andersen a ticket for disorderly conduct.
