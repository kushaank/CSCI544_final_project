COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s prisons agency is exploring a new way to catch jailbirds who tweet using banned cellphones.

Corrections Director Bryan Stirling told The Associated Press on Monday the agency had set up a link on its webpage where people can report inmate activity on social media networks.

Inmates are prohibited from having both cellphones and profiles on social media networks. But in the past, agency officials have said some offenders use contraband phones to set up online presences.
