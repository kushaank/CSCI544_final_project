
Romania was officially welcomed into the Lockheed Martin F-16 family at a reception preceding the Black Sea Defense Aerospace trade show. The Romanian Air Force is the 28th customer of the most widely used 4th generation multi-role fighter in the world.

Romania signed a Letter of Offer and Acceptance with the U.S. Government in December 2013 which provides programmatic support to a U.S.-approved third party transfer of F-16 aircraft from Portugal to Romania. That agreement delivers 12 F-16 Block 15 midlife upgrade aircraft to Romania beginning in 2016. Lockheed Martin will design, integrate and support the installation of updated F-16 software.

"Lockheed Martin takes great pride in the F-16, from initial production to capability upgrades through the life of the aircraft," said Roderick McLean, Lockheed Martin's vice president and general manager for the F-16/F-22 Integrated Fighter Group. "We look forward to supporting Romania's aircraft fleet modernization and establishing an enduring relationship as Romania revolutionizes its aviation capabilities to strengthen its national defense."

This year the F-16 Fighting Falcon celebrates 40 years of evolution, and remains the most effective 4th generation multi-role fighter in the world. More than 4,540 F-16 aircraft have been delivered to date, and production is expected to continue through 2017.Â  Lockheed Martin remains the preferred choice for F-16 major upgrade programs based on its proven performance, credible schedule execution and the most cost effective solutions for all F-16 versions.
