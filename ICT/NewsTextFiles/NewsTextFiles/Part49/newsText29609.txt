
During a Republican rally in Bowling Green over the weekend, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he’s proud to be the president’s number one problem and urged voters to return him to the U.S. Senate, where he would likely become Majority Leader.

"I've enjoyed being the defensive coordinator, and you can score occasionally on defense, but the offensive coordinator gets to call the plays, set the agenda, and choose a new direction for our country," said McConnell.

Meanwhile, presumed Democratic U.S. Senate nominee Grimes told a gathering of about 30 people in Franklin on Saturday that it's time to change senators after 30 years. She criticized McConnell for opposing increasing the minimum wage and measures ensuring women are paid the same salaries as men.
