This         statement was issued in the Kurdish city of Slêmanî         (Sulaimaniyah) and construct an image of the Kurds         that is permeated by miscricognition, distortion and         humiliation,” writes Barzoo Eliassi.

This type of Offensive narrative is to disregard a         nation‘s language and heritage history; it is grime         at its best and regrettable at its worst.

Alas, this kind of mind set of grim vision of         demonizing the people‘s language of being inferior.         “Class stratification systems”: It is just like Nazi         Party in Germany under Adolf Hitler postulated         “Aryan master race”, but the this kind of grim         vision of superiority was disapproved, most likely         that fallacy notion and dragged grandiose ambitious         resulted in World War II; with one of the         unimaginable of human costs and including the         destructions of many countries in the world.

Mr. Eliassi, or whatever your name is: If you and         the theocratic regime in Tehran believe that the all         social ills shall be repaired by dictatorial forces         system, you should think twice: Just a few examples;         just over three (3) decades ago look back to what         happen to brazen Pahlavi’s dynasty, what happened to         Dictator Hosni Mubarak’s regime in Egypt; Muammar         Kaddafi ‘s iron fist regime in Libya, and calamity         in Syria as a misguided policy‘s of Assad’s dynasty-         on the behave of Arab chauvinistic Ba’ath party. If         Iranian Mullah’s and other Iraqi neighbors take         their noses out of Iraqi internal affairs; the Iraqi         people will be able to figure out their differences         and problems. Since early 90’s, the Kurdistan         Regional Government (KRG) has been based in Hewlêr         (Erbil) is parliamentary system democracy with         regional assembly that consists 111 seats; it is a         coalition functioning government structure consists         from different political parties with wrangling         opinions; Verses to Iran only functioning government         via one political party, and its leaders hand-picked         by the “Guardian Council” up of theocrats, given to         the Iranian people to elect them.

Generally; Scholars and educators should research         and focus their attention how to find a solutions         for the problems; it appears that this region-         Middle East have many biased writer’s like Barzoo         Eliassi, who is un-authentically in the state of         denials of existence of Kurdish people with these         kinds of prejudiced attitude. Iranian MP Ebrahim Aga         Mohamedi who brazenly said Iraqi Kurd can’t have         autonomy, it is against international law; without         pin-pointing which codes of international         referencing too andwww.Ekurd.net another MP Hojatllah Soori who unabashedly demanded         that the Iraqi Kurd to assist them in fighting         against anti- Iranian government forces. It is look         like déjà vu, the future is bleak; no near solutions         are on the horizon, and future generations of all         isles will continue to suffer. At this junction, the         whole region with the lack of political confidence,         and with lack of front line leadership; it will also         continue to suffer not be used at its fullest         potential for all the people of this region.
