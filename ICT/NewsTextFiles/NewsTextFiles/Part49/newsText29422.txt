
One day I hope I'm rich enough that I don't even realize I lost $40,000.

I find 40k in a couch with a name on it, I go find that person and buy the rest of their shit.

That girl was excited when she said they said it could be drugs.  Bet if it was drugs they wouldn't have given it back.

Break: you'll never guess what these kids found in a used couch ? Break: well don't bother waiting to find out because its$40.000.

They should have given the money to Michael strahan. So he could fix those damn gapped teeth.

They were such retards!

What great people I would have drugged the other people until they forgot about the money then kept it for myself but... yea good for them.

I would have put the money to good use for the old bag.

They gave it to the rightful owner, good for them, they did the right thing. Â But in all honesty, I wouldn't have.

too the goodwill!
