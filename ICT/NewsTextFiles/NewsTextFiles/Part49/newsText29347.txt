With many new business ventures and start-ups emerging into the marketplace, it would appear as if the United States were increasingly adding to the number of small businesses. However, a recent report shows that over time, between 1978 and 2011, the U.S. economy has become less entrepreneurial.

The Brookings Institution's recent study on business dynamism measures the process by which firms continually are born, fail, expand and contract as some jobs are created, others are destroyed and others continue to be turned over.

"Research has firmly established that this dynamic process is vital to productivity and sustained economic growth," the study reads. "Entrepreneurs play a critical role in this process and in net job creation."

But the Brookings Institution's research shows that the dynamism is slowing down as fewer firms enter the economy, but more leave. The same is true locally, where a higher rate of firms are leaving the state than entering in the most recently measured time periods.

In Louisiana, from 1978-1980, the firm entry rate was at 14.3 percent, while from 2009 to 2011 the entry rate was 7 percent, a 51.1 percent drop between both measured periods.

In Baton Rouge, the firm entry rate was 14.3 percent from 1978-1980, but from 2009-2011, the rate dropped to 7.1 percent, a 50.5 percent drop.

From 1978 to 1980, Baton Rouge's firm exit rate was at 6.5 percent, however rose by 22.1 percent during the 2009-2011 period to 8 percent.

There was a lesser drop in the New Orleans-Metairie-Kenner area for the time periods. Its firm entry rate was 13.1 percent between 1978 and 1980, but for 2009-2011 dropped 46.8 percent to 6.9 percent firms entering the region.

The exit rate for the New Orleans-Metairie-Kenner area was at 6.7 percent for the 1978-1980 period, but jumped 16.5 percent to 7.8 percent firms exiting the area during the 2009-2011 period.

Fewer jobs were reallocated in recent years. The Pelican States' job reallocation rate was 37.4 percent from 1978-1980, but for the 2009-2011 period, dropped 30.1 percent to 26.1 percent.

Baton Rouge's job reallocation rate was at 37.9 percent for the 1978-1980 period, while for the 2009-2011 period it dropped 28.6 percent to a 27.1 percent reallocation for the area.

In the New Orleans-Metairie-Kenner area, jobs were reallocated at a 37.4 percent rate. For the 2009-2011 period, that rate dropped by 30.7 percent to 25.9 percent.

The study notes, "dynamism has declined in all fifty states and in all but a handful of the more than three hundred and sixty U.S. metropolitan areas during the last three decades. Moreover, the performance of business dynamism across the states and metros has become increasingly similar over time. In other words, the national decline in business dynamism has been a widely shared experience."

The Brookings Institution notes that reasons explaining the decline are still unknown, however "if it persists, it implies a continuation of slow growth for the indefinite future, unless for equally unknown reasons or by virtue of entrepreneurship enhancing policies (such as liberalized entry of high-skilled immigrants), these trends are reversed."
