
LAS CRUCES &GT;&GT; For generations, the Organ Mountains have been an iconic part of the Mesilla Valley.

Soon they will be part of a national monument.

President Obama is planning to sign a proclamation Wednesday establishing the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument, according to a White House official.

The proclamation is expected follow a bill introduced last December by U.S. Sens. Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich, Both D-NM, in covering about 450,000 acres in southern New Mexico. About half of that land — approximately 350 square miles — likely will be designated a wilderness area, the highest level of protection that can be imposed by Congress.

That includes the Organ Mountains; the Robledo Mountains northwest of Las Cruces, the Doña Ana Mountains north of Las Cruces; the Potrillo Mountains in the southwestern part of the county; and the Sierra de Las Uvas Mountains in the Hatch region.

Obama's proclamation represents a victory for monument supporters, a group working for much of the past decade to get such a designation. Recently it has been contentious.

Opponents have said a national monument designation could hurt ranching, flood control and expose the area, some of which is close to the Mexican border, to more criminal activity.
