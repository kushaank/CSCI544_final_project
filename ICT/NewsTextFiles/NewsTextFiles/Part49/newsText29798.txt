
Limpopo - Two women and four men have been arrested in connection with the killing of a woman in Giyani, who they believed had bewitched her sister-in-law, Limpopo police said on Sunday.

Two of the accused were arrested in Polokwane and the others were arrested in and around Giyani over the past few days, Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi.

On April 27, Catherina Nkovani, 52, was attacked and assaulted after her sister-in-law's funeral.

"The sister-in-law, Phindile Ngovani, was sick for quite some time before she died earlier in April. Following her funeral, members of the community, including the husband of the deceased, accused Nkovani of bewitching the deceased," Mulaudzi said.

Those arrested were believed to be Nkovani's relatives. They would appear in the Giyani Magistrate's Court on Monday to face charges of public violence and murder.

Mulaudzi said more arrests were expected.
