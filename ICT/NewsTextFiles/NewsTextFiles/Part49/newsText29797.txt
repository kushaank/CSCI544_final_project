
CAPE TOWN - A man was arrested after allegedly severely assaulting a two-year-old boy in Beaufort-West.

It's alleged he forced the boy to eat his own faeces, slapped and kicked the boy in the face, burned his feet with boiling water and also put a cement brick on the child's chest.

The assault took place while the man held his girlfriend and her child captive in their home in Mandela Square for several hours last week Thursday.

The 28-year-old was arrested on Saturday after a local community radio station appealed for help finding him.

The Police's Malcolm Pojie said the child is in a serious condition in hospital after undergoing emergency surgery.

Childlineâ€™s Joan van Niekerk described the attack as a horrendous act of violence against children.

The suspect is expected to appear in court today.
