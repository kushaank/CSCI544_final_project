This of course is rather         ridiculous given the fact that according to various         historical references, Kurds’ lineage dates back as         far as 2400 BC, where they occupied the same lands         as they do today. The first encounter of Persians         wasn’t until 2000 BCwww.Ekurd.net in central Asia. Thus Kurds         lived far early on in history than the Persians did.         Given, their history is very interlinked. The         Persians were closely associated with the Medes         (Kurds’ ancestors), and both encountered the Elamites, thereafter absorbing the Elamite culture.         So together, then Persians and Medes embraced the         Mesopotamian culture but they both were different         people when they met and neither equated to the         birth of the other. Therefore, for Iran today to         claim such allegations that Iran is the Kurd’s true         homeland and Kurds are an “Iranian people” is simply         false. Both people’s histories are linked in many         ways, but claiming that one is subordinate or         “indebted” in some way to the other is called         manipulating historical facts for one’s own benefit.

It is rather uncomplicated to manipulate, eradicate,         and deny the history of a people. Iran, Turkey,         Syria, and Iraq have been doing this to Kurds for         millennia’s. And given the recent statement by the         Iranian consulate, such injustice and fowl play         still goes on. For this reason it is simple for         countries like Iran, who has put so much effort into         manipulating and eradicating Kurdish history, to         claim to be the “all creator” of and “motherland”         for Kurds without a sliver of retaliation from its         neighbors because they do the same thing!

No matter what Iran claims is and is not history,         Kurds exist. Iran, you can manipulate a people’s         history and deny them their human right to exist,         but you cannot manipulate their memories, the         factual stories brought down from generations         before, you cannot manipulate Kurds into thinking         that they are lesser than you, and you cannot force         Kurds to submit to this injustice.
