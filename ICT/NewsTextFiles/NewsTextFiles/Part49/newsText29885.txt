SummaryThe political crisis in Bihar arising out of the resignation of Nitish Kumar as chief minister following the severe drubbing that JD-U suffered in the Lok Sabha election remained unresolved with the party failing to elect its "new" leader.

All JD(U) MLAs insisted that Kumar should continue, but Kumar refused to do so and sought time till tomorrow. Many of the legislators even threatened to sit on dharna if he refused to withdraw his resignation, party spokesman Sanjay Singh told reporters on a day of fast-paced political developments.

A meeting of the JD(U) Legislature Party has been called again tomorrow, Singh said.

Though the timing of the meeting has not been decided, legislators have been told to be in the town, MLC Neeraj Kumar said.

Even as JD(U) MLAs were holding a meeting, a BJP delegation met Governor D Y Patil and asked him to insist on a parade of individual MLAs and written support of all supporting parties if Nitish Kumar again staked claim to form government in the state.

Political temperature in Bihar rose amidst reports of efforts at realignment of old 'Janata Parivar' with Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar coming together to form a strong government in Bihar to keep communal forces away from power.

There were reports of JD(U) President Sharad Yadav and even Nitish Kumar talking to Lalu Prasad. But, the RJD chief told reporters that these were "baseless and concocted" and refused talking to either of them.

Earlier in the day, RJD and Congress convened meetings of their legislators tomorrow to discuss the emerging political scenario.
