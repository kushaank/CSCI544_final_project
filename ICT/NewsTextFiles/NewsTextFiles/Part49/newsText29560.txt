
Capt. Jeffrey Plummer, USNH Guam commanding officer, welcomed everyone to the ceremony and thanked all the personnel responsible for the new facility.

"The first thing I think we should do is thank the command families," Plummer said. "With long days and nights, extra shifts and working through holidays, there was a lot to do to get ready to move into the new facility. We could not have done it without the hard work and dedication of our staff and the support of our families."

The replacement hospital was built to provide a more efficient, modern hospital infrastructure, which meets all current building, electrical, mechanical and structural seismic codes and standards. The hospital also offers more efficient patient, staff and supply circulation, and improved survivability from earthquake and typhoon damage.

"This is amazing brick and mortar, but what it really is, is an environment of care, a statement of construction and the latest and greatest technology that says to all those who enter, we care, that this is centered around you," said Vice Adm. Matthew L. Nathan, surgeon general of the Navy, chief of the Navy's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. "We stand by in Navy Medicine to fulfill our commitment and our motto to you every day: 'World Class Care Anywhere, Anytime.'"
