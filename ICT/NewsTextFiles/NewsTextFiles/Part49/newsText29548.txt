
Suddenly, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is all the rage. And that’s just the way he likes it.

Reid was the subject of a couple of stories recently, neither especially flattering. One declared him dedicated to all manner of evil, while the other asserted he’s become the right’s new boogeyman, despite the fact that no one knows who he is.

The National Review Online — never a big fan of Nevada’s senior senator — hit hard with a piece titled “Clown of the Senate .” (Beware; you have to pay a quarter to see the full article.) The piece purports to trace Reid’s political career, with an eye towards mocking him.

Tough on the mob? Sure, but mobster Joe Agosto boasted about having Reid — aka “Clean Face” — in his pocket.

After comparing Reid — unfavorably — to infamous Wisconsin Sen. Joseph McCarthy, Williamson denounces Reid for embracing a proposed constitutional amendment to allow Congress to limit campaign fundraising and spending . “Which is to say, Harry Reid proposes to punch James Madison in the face like wants to date his daughter,” Williamson writes. Nice one.

“To normal independent voters, the most obscure story possible would be a fight between Reid and the Koch brothers over Benghazi,” said John Pitney, a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, California, in a reference to the 2012 attack on a Libya diplomatic post that left four Americans dead.

“Most normal human beings outside of the state of Nevada neither know nor care who Harry Reid is. I’m sure most people associate the Koch brothers with a certain cola beverage,” Pitney said.

The story reports that a George Washington University poll conducted March 16-20 found 41 percent either didn’t recognize Reid or had no opinion of him; another 35 percent had a negative view of the senator. A Gallup poll conducted April 24-30 found 32 percent didn’t recognize Reid; 41 percent had a negative view of him.
