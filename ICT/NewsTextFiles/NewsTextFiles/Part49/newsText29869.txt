
May is Skin Cancer Awareness month across America. This particular topic is dear to me because I lost my mother to Skin Cancer in 2008. My mother was diagnosed with Metastatic Melanoma. Her story was quite unique in that the visible skin cancer was successfully removed when she was in her 20s. Later in life, the cancer returned and was invasive and very aggressive. As you can imagine, because of my family history, I make sure to schedule an appointment each year for an annual checkup.

Diameter - Is the diameter larger than a pencil eraser (usually greater than 6mm)? In some cases however, melanoma can be smaller.

Another great tip is to have a loved one take a picture of your back or take a picture of your legs. Take the same pictures several months later and try to spot changes. I would still advise an annual checkup with a professional but this is just another great way to help with early detection. Also, check parts of your body that do not necessarily receive direct sunlight. Check between your toes or under your arms. Skin cancer doesn't always pop-up on your back, shoulder, or face.
