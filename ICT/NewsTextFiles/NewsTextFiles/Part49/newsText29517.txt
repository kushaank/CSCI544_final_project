
Vice President Joe Biden turned down a Connecticut teenager's prom invitation - but instead sent her a corsage and invited her to the White House.

Talia Maselli, 18, wrote a letter to Biden seven months ago inviting him to be her date and edge out any competition, according to The Hartford Courant.

'I am inviting you so far in advance because I'm sure many 17-year-old girls send you prom invitations, and I had to beat them to it,' she wrote. 'I could only tolerate a high school dance if I was to be escorted by the most delightful man in America.'

Biden was unable to attend - but he had a handpicked corsage and handwritten note sent to her home the day before the big dance.

Biden personally picked the corsage flowers, which included baby's breath, white roses, along with red, white and blue ribbons.

Maselli did not go to the prom, but is expected to meet Biden at the White House in July.
