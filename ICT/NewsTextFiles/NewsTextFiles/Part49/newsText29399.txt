
LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- Criminal charges are being filed against five Chinese Military officials accused of trying to steal U.S. trade secrets.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder addressed the indictment today.

"This administration will not tolerate actions by any nation that seeks to illegally sabotage American companies and undermine the integrity of fair competition in the operation of the free market," Holder said.

The officers are accused of hacking into six American companies in the Pittsburgh area.

The charges are said to be the first ever against Chinese State officials for what the U.S. says is a widespread problem.

In a statement, China's foreign ministry spokesman calls the charges "fabricated, fictitious and extremely absurd."
