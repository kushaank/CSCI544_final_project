
It has long been thought that human urine is sterile, but new research suggests this is not the case.

Scientists found bacteria live in the bladders of healthy women, meaning their urine is not sterile after all.

However, the researchers also found that the bacteria in the urine of healthy women are different to those found in the bladders of women with overactive bladders.

This finding could pave the way for new treatments for women with the condition which means they suffer sudden urges to urinate.

‘Doctors have been trained to believe that urine is germ-free,’ said Dr Linda Brubaker, from Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine.

Evann Hilt, lead investigator and second year master's student at the university added: ‘The presence of certain bacteria in women with overactive bladder may contribute to [their] symptoms.

One possible explanation for the lack of response to medication may be the bacteria present in these women.

‘If we can determine that certain bacteria cause [overactive bladder] symptoms, we may be able to better identify those at risk for this condition and more effectively treat them,’ said Dr Alan Wolfe, co-investigator and professor of Microbiology and Immunology.

Researchers evaluated urine samples from 90 women with and without overactive bladder.

They used a new technique which enabled them to detect bacteria that would not previously have been identified.

The researchers now plan to determine which bacteria in the bladder are helpful and which are harmful.
