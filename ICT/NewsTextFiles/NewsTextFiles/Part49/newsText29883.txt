
Bradford’s Dubrovnik Hotel will host a special lunch to boost the Telegraph & Argus Bradford Crocus Cancer Appeal tomorrow.

The event, organised by the University of Bradford, will include a two-course meal and the chance to hear Professor Laurence Patterson from the university talk about the importance of the appeal, which aims to raise £1 million for the discovery and development of cancer medicines.

Lunch will be served at 12.30pm, with tickets costing £18.50 per head, at least £5 of which will go towards the appeal. To book a place, call the hotel on (01274) 543511.
