
The Coast Guard brought out two of its choppers from Clearwater and Georgia to join the effort. A cutter boat and a search plane also joined the search.

According to lifeguards, they saw a man struggling in the water about 300 feet from shore by the Main Street Pier.

However, the Coast Guard said there have been no reports from the public of swimmers missing from Daytona Beach, but the lifeguard who put in the call said he recognizes the man as someone who frequents the beach.

The initial search included a helicopter and two watercraft, as well as lifeguards, but they didn't find anyone, nor any sign of him since.

Officials said rip currents were bad on Sunday and are expected to be rough once again on Monday.
