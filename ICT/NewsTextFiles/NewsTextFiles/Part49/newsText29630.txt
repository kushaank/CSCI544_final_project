The woman's 70-year-old partner was also killed in the crash. Her 34-year-old daughter was injured and remains at Harborview Medical Center. The driver and her 3-year-old grandson, who was also in the SUV, were not hurt.

"For whatever reason, her vehicle shot through her house and went all the way through and exited out the house partially going into Lake Sammamish," said King County Sheriff's Sgt. DB Gates.

Gates said the woman is being investigated for vehicular homicide, but has been released from county jail. She said detectives are reconstructing what happened.

Results from toxicology tests are pending.
