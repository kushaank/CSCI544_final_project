
RENO, Nev. (AP) — Aimal Halim used to dream of coming to America when he was working as an interpreter in his native Afghanistan for the Nevada Army National Guard.

Not only did he make the trip, he ended up earning a degree in political science at the University of Nevada, Reno this week thanks in large part to a Guard officer who befriended him.

The Reno Gazette-Journal reports Lt. Col. Kurt Neddenriep promised Halim in 2009 he would pay for his college education if he got accepted at Nevada.

Halim ended up graduating with a 3.21 grade point average. Now he wants to pursue a graduate degree in conflict resolution.

He hopes to put it to good use back in his home country running for public office or heading a nonprofit organization.
