
NEW YORK--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Syncarpha Capital (“Syncarpha”), in partnership with a private family        office, has begun a new $250 million solar program and has closed a new        tax equity fund with a major U.S. commercial bank.

Recently, Syncarpha began a program with a private family office to        rapidly deploy $250 million of sponsor equity for distributed solar in        North America. Syncarpha, as manager, is looking to expand its network        of developers who have a strong pipeline of U.S. solar projects.        Syncarpha will partner with solar developers to quickly complete        development or acquire late stage or Notice to Proceed (“NTP”)        development projects while supplying the entire capital stack using        several proven financing structures.

Syncarpha has closed a new tax equity fund with a major U.S. commercial        bank. This is Syncarpha’s second tax equity fund with this institution        and it will be used to support our latest solar program in        Massachusetts. The bank is a leader in providing tax equity to        distributed generation solar development projects throughout the U.S.

“As distributed generation grows into an important asset class, our team        and our partners are highly motivated to put significant dollars to work        in this large and fast growing market. This is a high return category        with inherently good credit and duration that is uncorrelated with        traditional asset classes. We are excited to have found a capital        partner that understands the potential for distributed generation        projects and is interested in being a long-term partner in independent        power producers,” said Richard Turnure, Managing Partner of Syncarpha        Capital.
