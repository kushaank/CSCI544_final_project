
A 21-YEAR-OLD Grade 10 pupil of Kansenshi Secondary School in Ndola has been sentenced to six months imprisonment with hard labour by the Ndola Magistrate’s Court for stealing polony and two packets of meat from Shoprite.

“I find the accused guilty on his own admission of the facts. I take note that the accused is a first offender who readily admitted the charge without wasting the court’s time.

“I, therefore, sentence you to six months imprisonment with hard labour with effect from May 10, the date on which you were arrested,” Mr Akende said.

Particulars of the offence are that Zulu on May 7 this year in Ndola, stole polony and two packets of meat altogether worth K107.37 from Shoprite.

In mitigation, Zulu begged the court to be lenient on him.

Zulu submitted that he stole the polony and meat because he wanted to go and eat them.

Facts before the court read by public prosecutor Chrispin Mukubanda were that on that day around 13:00 hours,  a security guard at Shoprite  identified as Davison Sichone saw a suspicious  person with some packets of meat and polony trying to leave without paying.

Mr Sichone gave chase and apprehended Zulu.
