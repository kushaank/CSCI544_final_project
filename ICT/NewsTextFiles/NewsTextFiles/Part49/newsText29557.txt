
Guam - JGPO Director Joe Ludivichi says that at no time would the proposed "Surface Danger Zone" over part of the Ritidian Wildlife Refuge force the closer of the entire refugee.

Ludivichi pointed out that most of the refuge is already restricited and not open to public access. However he also pointed out that most of the Refuge which is currently accessible to the public, would still be accessible, even when the firing range complex was in use.

"365 days of a year ... 100 plus acres, plus about three-quarters of a mile of  beach front would still be available [to the public], independent of the firing range", said Ludivichi.

The Draft SEIS projects that the firing range complex may be in use for up to 39 weeks a year.

But Ludivichi said only "about 12% of the overall refugee" would be restricted by the Surface Danger Zone, and then, only when the machine gun firing range was in use. He said the machine gun firing range would NOT be used all 39 weeks, but he could not say just how many weeks it would be in use.

PNC: "The Surface Danager Zone, if it were to cover a part of the Refugee, at no time would that cause the closure of the entire Refugee?"

Ludivichi also said  that the SDZ would not physically disturb the culture sites at Ritidian. "The only significant impact [of the SDZ] would be access", he said.
