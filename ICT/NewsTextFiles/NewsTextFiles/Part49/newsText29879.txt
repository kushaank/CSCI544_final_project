
Controversial actor Kamaal Rashid Khan is in news again and this time for a good reason. The actor, as promised, is leaving India after Narendra Modi’s victory.

KRK had earlier stated that he will leave Twitter and India forever if BJP Chief Minister Narendra Modi will become the Prime Minister of India. KRK’s earlier tweet said, “It’s my challenge to entire world that if @narendramodi ji will become next PM then I shall not leave only twitter but India also forever”.
