
The usual food safety advice applies in the latest ground beef recall: Don't order that hamburger rare.

A Michigan-based company has recalled 1.8 million pounds of ground beef earmarked for use at restaurants in four states, including Missouri, for possible E. Coli contamination.

Though E. Coli occurs naturally in the gut of cows, it's relatively easy to avoid, says University of Missouri food science professor Azlin Mustapha.

"The takeaway message is to cook beef to the United States Department of Agriculture recommended temperature and you should be OK," says Mustapha.

Beef must reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees to meet food safety guidelines . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends home cooks use a meat thermometer to check the temperature of their beef.
