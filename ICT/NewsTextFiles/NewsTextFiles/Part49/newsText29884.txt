
I started this beautiful day walking down to grab a pastry from the French Bakery and a coffee.  I have been thinking on things I may see while I'm here in LA, and of course, Disney is a possibility.  It looks like the Science Center starts a Pompeii expo tomorrow which might be fun to see before my travels to Italy.  Either way, there is plenty to do before I leave.

I ended up doing some quick last minute shopping and grabbed some Mexican food.  My plan is to hit Disney tomorrow.  This is my 7th visit to LA and now I'll finally get to goto Disneyland.
