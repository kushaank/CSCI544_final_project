
Former Democratic Virginia Sen. Jim Webb expressed interest in running for president in an interview Monday on the public radio program “The Diane Rehm Show,” while also leveling some criticisms at the Obama administration.

“My wife and I are just thinking about what to do next. I care a lot about where the country is, and we’ll be sorting that out,” Webb said when asked about possible presidential ambitions.

“Well, if you look at how I ran for the Senate, I announced nine months to the day before the election with no money and no campaign staff. It takes me a while to decide things and I’m not going to say one way or another,” Webb said.

Webb, a Vietnam veteran and former Secretary of the Navy who served in the U.S. Senate from 2007 to 2013, said that he is not interested in being vice president.

Webb also made some pointed criticisms of the current administration’s foreign and domestic policy.

“The thing that concerns me the most is that we are kind of bouncing from issue to issue without a clear articulation of what the national security interest of the United States actually is,” Webb added.

While Hillary Clinton continues to benefit from the narrative that Elizabeth Warren could challenge her from the left in a Democratic primary – establishing Clinton as a moderate in the public consciousness – Webb represents a threat to Clinton from the Democratic right.
