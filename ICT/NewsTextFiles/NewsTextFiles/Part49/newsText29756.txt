
Vietnam has reaffirmed its commitment to enhance defence research-and-development (R&D) capabilities through investment and collaboration with foreign primes.

The pledge was made by Vietnam's Deputy Defence Minister Lieutenant General Truong Quang Khanh on 18 May in a statement issued by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to mark the country's national science and technology day.

Khanh noted that Vietnam's efforts to bolster defence R&D have in recent years benefitted the local industry's efforts to supply the Vietnam People's Army (VPA) with what are regarded as key technologies and systems related to surveillance, patrol and communications as well as armour and "fighting power".
