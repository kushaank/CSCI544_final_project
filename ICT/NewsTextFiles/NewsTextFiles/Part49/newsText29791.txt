
SANAA, Yemen — Yemen's Shiite rebel group has presented the government with new demands in order to stop their protests, hardening their positions and prolonging the standoff that has brought protest tents to the capital.

A member of a Yemeni presidential delegation said the group, which had asked for a new government and restoring fuel subsidies, wants to have more representation in a national review agency that overlooks the rewriting of the constitution and implementing a new federal system. Earlier talks have failed to break-up the massive protests in the capital.

The official said the group has also hardened its demands, specifying that the new government program must be approved by consensus within two weeks. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to journalists.
