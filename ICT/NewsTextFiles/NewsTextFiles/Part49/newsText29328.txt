
THE US city of Pikeville, Tennessee has come down hard on saggy pants, approving fines for trousers worn more than three inches below the top of the hips.

The City Council unanimously voted in favour of the ordinance on public indecency, which enforces a fine of not less than US$25 ($27) for a first offence and not more than US$50 on subsequent offences, the Times Free Press reports .

The law, which covers other acts of indecency including sexual acts and public urination, is likely to come into effect within a couple of months.

Similar ordinances have been passed in recent years by several US cities and municipalities, mostly in the South, the Independent reports . The trend is thought to have originated in the US prison system, where belts are banned, and been popularised in rap and hip-hop culture.

Some, however, think the edicts are an infringement of civil liberties. “Clothing is a form of expression protected under the Constitution of the United States,” says Marjorie Esman of the American Civil Liberties Union.
