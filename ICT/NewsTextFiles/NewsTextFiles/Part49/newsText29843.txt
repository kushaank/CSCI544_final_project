
A surfer in Hawaii has been charged with attempted second-degree murder after she allegedly tried to kill someone with her car last Wednesday.

Aspiring surfer and model Jill Hansen was arrested after allegedly hitting a 73-year-old woman who was getting out of her car, reports Reuters .

Honolulu City Prosecutor's Office spokesman Dave Koga said a witness intervened by breaking the rear window of Hansen's car, which caused her to run away. The elderly woman, Elizabeth Conklin, was taken to the hospital for a head injury and cuts and bruises.

According to KHON2 , the incident took place in an underground parking garage and police arrested her not that long ago she fled the scene.

On Monday she had her first court appearance where the bail was set at $1 million and Hansen reportedly left the courtroom by blowing a kiss to those inside.

Koga noted that she has been pulled over several times before for reckless driving and still has two other traffic cases that aren't closed. If found guilty of attempted second degree murder, the surfer would face a mandatory life sentence, with the possibility of parole.
