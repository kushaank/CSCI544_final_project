SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- The American offensive against the Iroquois Confederacy in Upstate New York during the Revolutionary War is the subject of an upcoming program at the New York State Military Museum .

The free Memorial Day weekend program at the museum in Saratoga Springs on Saturday will be presented by sociologist, artist and writer Robert Spiegelman.

He'll use animated maps and dramatic art to tell the story of the campaign led by Major General John Sullivan and Brigadier General James Clinton from June to October 1779 against the Onondaga, Cayuga and Seneca nations.

The first attack in that campaign came when Col. Goose Van Schaick led a surprise assault against the Onondaga Nation's settlements on April 21, 1779, taking 34 prisoners and killing 12 others.

The campaign was launched to stop Iroquois and Tory attacks on the New York frontiers.

Although the Sullivan/Clinton campaign has more historical commemorative markers than any other event in New York, it has been nearly forgotten.
