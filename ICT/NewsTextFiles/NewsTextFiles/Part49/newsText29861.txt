
CHEMISTS still rake in millions to dish out methadone to drug addicts – despite calls for the system to be overhauled.

Scotland to distribute the heroin substitute – an average of £16,000 each.

But 22 chemists received payments of more than £100,000 each.

The revelation comes just months after the Scottish Government agreed a review of the controversial programme.

The highest earners are big chains.

Boots got almost £4million in 2012, while Lloyds Pharmacy pocketed £3.6million and the Co-operative Group collected £739,000.

Independent chemists are also benefiting from public cash for dishing out the heroin substitute, with methadone millionaire Denis Houlihan being the biggest earner.

The Irishman’s shop in Glasgow’s Possilpark collected £117,000.

His eight other shops in the city received between £1200 and £69,000.

In 2012, the Daily Record revealed how the taxpayer stumped up £36million in just one year to pay for methadone for 22,000 users – despite Holyrood being unable to provide proof the scheme is helping them get clean.

Professor Neil McKeganey, a former government adviser, has slammed the system, which has seen some addicts prescribed the over-the-counter fix for decades.

Methadone has also been blamed for almost 300 deaths since 2012.

Scottish Tory health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said it was “extremely concerning” that huge amounts continue to be spent on the failing programme.

He said: “Instead of efforts being made to get people off drugs completely, too many are being parked on the drug for years.
