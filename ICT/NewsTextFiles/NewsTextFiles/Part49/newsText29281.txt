
Opposition leader Daniel Andrews says the system to prevent family violence is broken and only a Royal Commission will get the answers to fix it.

Labor has pledged to establish a Royal Commission into family violence if it wins the November election.

Anti-domestic violence advocates have welcomed the plan but the state government says the money would be better spent on services.

Mr Andrews told Neil Mitchell politicians don't have all the answers.

"If we do more of the same policy, we'll see more of the same tragedy," Mr Andrews said.

"I want to get to the bottom of this. I want all of the good things that are happening to be joined up.

"We want reform and change and yes it will cost a lot but it's money worth spending."

Community Services Minister Mary Wooldridge says the government has put policies in place to deal with domestic violence and it getting on with the job.

"As a government we've invested in a lot of different areas, trying to reform and improve how to keep women and children safe, how we deal with perpetrators," she said.

"And we know, yes more can be done but there's very clear recommendations from the sector. They know what needs to be done as well.

"That's what the work needs to focus on, not more conversation."

Every male policemen in Victoria knows what world statistics now show, that women are just as violent as men when it comes to intimate partner violence. There is also growing evidence that women are more emotionally and verbally abusive than men in modern relationships. Daniel Andrews in asking for a Royal Commission is a cynical move to try and win younger women's votes for the election. This is the trouble in Aus politics today. Younger women are the swinging voters. Andrews should stop showing off to women and tackle the broader issue of violence in society which includes male victims who are discouraged from speaking out in a macho society.
