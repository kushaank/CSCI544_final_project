
A Vandegrift High School student has been arrested after he brought an unloaded gun to school, officials said.

The 17-year-old was taken into custody Monday morning after the student was found in possession of a small caliber hand gun at the Northwest Austin school, principal Charlie Little said in a letter to parents. There was no ammunition in the gun and no students or staff were in any danger at any time, he said.

The student has been charged with possession of a weapon on school property, a third degree felony, according to the Travis County precinct 2 constable office. Officials are still investigating why he brought the gun to school.
