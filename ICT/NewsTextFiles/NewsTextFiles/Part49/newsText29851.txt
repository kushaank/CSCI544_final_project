
Hostility against President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Jubilee administration in Western Kenya may have reached fever pitch, with some of the President’s strong allies now contemplating political divorce with the Head of State.

This weekend, a technical team of the Amani Coalition, which brings together United Democratic Forum (UDF), New Ford-Kenya (NFK) and Kanu, is on a retreat at Lake Elementaita, Nakuru County, to review their pact with the President’s coalition.

And speaking through his spokesman, Kibisu Kabatesi, UDF leader and former Deputy Prime Minister Musalia Mudavadi observed that the fact that local leaders were raising issues now was an indicator that the Amani-Jubilee agreement was in jeopardy.

“MPs have complained of being excluded from consultations in Parliament on critical Bills by Jubilee leadership in the House. But obviously there has been disquiet about whether the agreements are worth anything anymore,” Kabatesi said.

“I am aware that our people are disappointed with this government over its failure to appoint members of the Luhya community to top positions. What I did not know, however, is that their rage had reached fever pitch,” says Savula.

Navakholo MP Emmanuel Wagwe, Alfred Sambu of Webuye East and Dan Wanyama of Webuye West accuse the government of kicking out or demoting members of the community from plum parastatal jobs while at the same time failing to implement tangible development projects to benefit locals. They now want all MPs from the region allied to Jubilee to decamp.
