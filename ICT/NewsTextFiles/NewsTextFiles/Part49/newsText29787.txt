
BEIJING — China has criticised the top official of the Association of South-east Asian Nations (ASEAN) for saying Beijing intruded in Vietnamese territory and a Chinese official has demanded the group stay out of the dispute.

A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Mr Hong Lei, said the ASEAN secretary-general was sending “wrong signals” about the dispute over China’s deployment of an oil rig to disputed waters in the South China Sea.

The secretary-general, Mr Le Luong Minh, who is Vietnamese, told The Wall Street Journal on Friday that “we have to get China out of the territorial waters of” Vietnam.

China and Vietnam each have overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea that have triggered tensions for years.

The latest round erupted on May 1 when Beijing deployed a large oil rig close to the Paracel Islands, which are controlled by China but claimed by Vietnam. Hanoi immediately sent ships to confront the rig.

They are now locked in a standoff with Chinese ships protecting the rig, raising fears of possible conflict.

Tensions boiled over last week, when anti-Chinese violence by thousands of Vietnamese workers broke out in numerous provinces, resulting in the deaths of two Chinese workers.  More than 100 others were injured.

Around 400 factories were damaged or destroyed in mob violence, most in industrial parks close to southern Ho Chi Minh City. Many factories were not Chinese-run, but Taiwanese or from elsewhere in Asia, apparently targeted mistakenly or by gangs intent on looting.

Vietnam’s government initially allowed street protests, a rarity in the authoritarian country. But since the rioting, they have cracked down, aware that the violence threatened the country’s reputation as a safe and cheap destination for foreign manufacturers to establish.
