
Exiled Zimbabweans are concerned with the current power squabbles in the MDC-T which pose a threat to the restoration of democracy and economic revival in the country, creating uncertainty over their return to their homeland.

Zimbabwe Exiles Forum (ZEF) chairperson, Gabriel Shumba said the developments in the MDC-T were retarding progress towards democratic change in the country and consequently dampening hopes of exiles returning to Zimbabwe.

He blamed some officials within the MDC-T for working towards self-aggrandisement at the expense of the people's interests.

Shumba said that as a result, people were beginning to lose faith in the struggle for democracy in the country and predicted that many more Zimbabweans would leave the country.

Shumba said a lot still needed to be done to restore the people's faith in the people's struggle.

The MDC-T United Kingdom treasurer, Taurai Chamboko said developments in Zimbabwe were a pointer that the time for the return of exiles "might never come".
