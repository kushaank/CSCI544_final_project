
WASHINGTON — A civil rights icon from Georgia is the latest Democrat to oppose one of President Barack Obama's picks to become a federal judge from that state.

Rep. John Lewis said Monday that Michael Boggs, Obama's nominee for the position, has stood against everything Lewis has championed during his career. Lewis was a prominent civil rights leader before coming to Congress.

As a Georgia state legislator, Boggs opposed efforts to remove the Confederate battle insignia from the state flag and favored posting online information about doctors who provide abortions.

Obama nominated Boggs as a part of a deal with Georgia's two senators to fill seven vacancies in that state's federal bench.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said last week he opposes Boggs' nomination.
