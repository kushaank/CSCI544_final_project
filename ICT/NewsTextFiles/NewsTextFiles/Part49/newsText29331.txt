
Virginia State Police received a tip that Thomas Ward was staying in the Millspring Townes complex, instead of the residence listed on the sex offender registry.

When troopers arrived, Ward refused to come out from the home, located near Dumbarton Elementary School, and barricaded himself inside. Police called in tactical units to try and get him to safely come out from the apartment.

Ward eventually came out, but appeared to have suffered self-inflicted injuries. He was taken to Henrico Doctors Hospital for evaluation.

Authorities said Ward, 40, has been charged with felony probation violation and the investigation turned over to the Virginia Department of Corrections Probation and Parole. Henrico police assisted state police at the scene.
