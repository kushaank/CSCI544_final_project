
The Department of Justice plans to announce charges against specific Chinese government officials, accusing them of stealing American trade secrets through cyber espionage .

This will be the first time the U.S. government has publicly accused employees of a foreign power with cyber crimes against American firms.

“An official familiar with the case says the charges will accuse Chinese government employees of using military and intelligence facilities to commit cyber espionage against U.S. companies,” NBC’s Pete Williams said Monday.
