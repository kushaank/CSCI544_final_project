The Livestock Conservancy, in partnership with Southern States, Virginia Cooperative Extension, the Framer Veterans Coalition and others in the industry, is offering an alternative for veterans to consider:  raising heritage livestock and poultry.

A workshop is being offered June 6-7 at the Stoneridge Events Center in Warrenton, Va., to educate and train service men and women on the skills necessary to steward some of Americas most historic and endangered farm animals.

Our goal is to help returning veterans and retired service members succeed financially in heritage breed, sustainable agriculture by providing them with the knowledge and skills they need, explained Livestock Conservancy Executive Director Eric Hallman.

Established in 1977, the Livestock Conservancy works to protect nearly 200 breeds of livestock and poultry from extinction.  The workshop will feature a day of presentations on various breeds of heritage livestock, getting started and discussions on economics and marketing. The following day, participants will tour one of three farm operations to hear discussions about breeding and herd management of grass-fed cattle; integrating farming for fun and profit with heritage livestock; and low-impact techniques for handling sheep and chickens.

Registration is on a first-come, first served basis with priority given to service men and women. There is a fee  but scholarships are available. For more information, visit www.LivestockConservancy.org  . For scholarship information please email amartin@albc-usa.org .
