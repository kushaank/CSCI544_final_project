
MADURAI: The fact finding team of People’s Union for Human Rights (PUHR) which investigated the armed attack by caste Hindu groups on Dalits at Melamangalam village in Theni on April 6, demanded action against 20 caste Hindus under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989 and legitimate compensation to Dalits, who fled the village fearing further attacks.

Narrating the incident at a press meet A Rajini, convener of PUHR said “the attack was fuelled by the love affair between Suresh (32) belonging to Dalit community and Muthulakshmi, a caste Hindu, who were missing from the first week of April.”  A caste Hindu group and relatives of Muthulakshmi after assuming that the lovers were living under the care of Dalits, threatened the village Dalit leader to handover the girl to them.

Murugapandi, a Dalit from the village praised Suresh in front of caste Hindu leaders in the village in an inebriated state. Following this, hundreds of caste hindus armed withlethal weapons attacked the Dalit colony in Melamangalam village and torched six houses.

Saying that the police denied permission to enter the village sighting law and order issue she said “we approached the High Court and obtained permission to carry out an investigation on April 14, 2014. We were shocked to know that neither the police nor the district administration bothered to look into the incident until we informed about our visit.” Despite filing case under SC/ST Act by the police against 20 caste Hindus involved in the attack, the perpetrators managed to get bail within three or four days, since police did not file strong cases against them,” said Syed Abdul Khader, State PRO for National Commission for Human Rights.
