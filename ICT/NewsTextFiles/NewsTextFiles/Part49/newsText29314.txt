Passion, I believe, is the most important part of any start-up. This keeps the founders focused on the mission and the end goal. An experienced team can be an amazing asset, but people working on the wrong path can drain resources quickly. Use the passion to find the right path, then add people to accelerate down that path.

Startups depend on people to make things happen. Passion is the fuel that drives startup people. Rarely is there a successful startup with passionate people but no skills.

The right people will have the passion. People drive everything. The right management team will possess a solid combination of skills, work ethic, perspective and perseverance. Passion is important, but with out the right person harnessing it, it can lead to fatal blind spots.

The people are an absolute critical part of any businessâ€™ success. When the passion permeates a companyâ€™s culture, it attracts the kind of people that donâ€™t just want a job, they want a home which ultimately creates job satisfaction as well as success for the company.
