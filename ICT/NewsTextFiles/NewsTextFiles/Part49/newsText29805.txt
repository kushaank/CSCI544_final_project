
Twenty-two youths from poor communities in the Eastern Cape have received scholarships of about R1 million from the provincial Social Development Department to study at the Stenden University South Africa in Port Alfred.

The university is a private entity which specialises in hospitality studies and attracts mainly students from rich families. 11 of the 22 students, who will be trained for a year, will be absorbed by one of the hotels which are in partnership with the university.

Amanda Tyhobeka and Muzi Ndlovu say this is a dream come true.

"This opportunity is a blessing in disguise because my family, my community as a whole is going to achieve a lot. In my village, we still have a small problem whereby the rate of teenage pregnancy is growing and others are being raped."

"It's going to make a big change because now I believe I'm going from nothing to something, so itâ€™s going to change my family and my community."

Provincial Social Development HOD, Nombulelo Hackula, says they have given these young people an opportunity to empower themselves.

"When we selected these children we looked at the most needy children in our province and making sure that when they go back they will be able to be change agents in their own families and in their communities."

Hackula says that the kind of training the students will be receiving will not only enable them to be job seekers, but also empower them to be job creators.

"It is important therefore that we look at the two prong approach while we are dealing with social ills that are facing our community and most of them are perpetrated by young people and some of which are doing it out of desperation."
