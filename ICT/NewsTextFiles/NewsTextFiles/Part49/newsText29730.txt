
A hypothetical analysis could predict trouble for Sears, one of America’s oldest retailers. According to the Cowen Group’s John Kernan, “Sears could be close to calling it quits”.

Kernan’s remarks are attributed to the latest Sears decision to sell all, or parts of Sears Canada. This story is covered in detail by the  New York Times .

Other news outlets, such as CNN, have published stories citing similar trends and analysis, like  Sears: ‘Burning cash,’ closing stores.

Kernan has been cited by CNN, saying “They have too many stores and they’re losing a lot of money, burning cash.” He continued “They’re basically completely irrelevant”.

Since Kernan’s statement aired, share prices fell 3.37% immediately after the market opened, but quickly recovered. The last television mention citing John Kernan was out of Champaign, Illinois at 7:50 CST.

At its height, Sears was the country’s biggest retailer. Today, Sears has a number of competitors, from Home Depot and Wal-Mart, to Target and Amazon.

Another contributing analyst to CNN, Brian Sozzi, CEO of Belus Capital Advisors, said to CNN that he expects that there will be more Sears closings without any formal announcement.
