
Greater Milwaukee Committee president Julia Taylor spoke a few words at the announcement on the Summerfest grounds.

Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett referenced that "flying car" scene standing near the same bridge Monday at Summerfest's Briggs & Stratton stage, announcing a partnership between the massive music festival and Flying Car, the Greater Milwaukee Committee's three-day technology and innovation series.

"There is nothing that sells Milwaukee like Summerfest," Barrett said.

The partnership also sells Flying Car, said Don Smiley , president and CEO of Summerfest organizer Milwaukee World Festival Inc. He said both Summerfest and Flying Car seek the same core, young demographic. Flying Car can essentially leverage Summerfest's established brand to draw attendees, and both can benefit from the cross-promotion, Smiley said.

As part of the partnership, Summerfest will provide free weekday admission tickets to Flying Car participants. Additionally, Briggs & Stratton Corp. will host â€œFlying Car Dayâ€� at the Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard on Thursday, June 26, while Robert DeLong , an electronic musician performing at Summerfest, will host a lab and provide an exclusive VIP performance at Flying Car.
