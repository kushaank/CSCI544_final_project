
REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Silver Spring Networks, Inc. (NYSE: SSNI) today announced a new        partnership with Detectent, Inc., as it continues to expand its partner        ecosystem around the SilverLink™ Sensor Network, a new approach to        unlocking smart grid big data at up to 10x the speed and 1/10th the cost        of traditional IT infrastructure. Detectent is a leading provider of        analytical models and user interface tools that will leverage SilverLink        Sensor Network data to support the planning, deployment and measurement        of operational business functions including revenue assurance,        non-technical loss, transformer monitoring, and grid operations        applications. Detectent’s solutions will be offered through Silver        Spring’s SilverLink App Catalogue.

Detectent’s Energy Theft solutions are part of its Customer Intelligence        Platform which will be integrated with the SilverLink Sensor Network.        Detectent uses a combination of smart meter data along with weather        data, business listings, GIS data and other data to identify electricity        theft. Once an irregularity is confirmed or dismissed, the self-learning        algorithms update the information to improve the accuracy of future        analysis. The SiverLink Sensor Network will enable Detectent to access        real-time smart grid data streams, helping utilities accelerate the        assessment of any action associated with irregular energy consumption        and diversion within a service territory. Detectent’s application also        integrates with existing utility workflow systems.

Detectent also expects to leverage real-time streams via the SilverLink        Sensor Network for improved grid operations, such as pinpointing        overloaded transformers and topology mapping errors.
