
THE nurses union wants to meet with NSW Health Minister Jillian Skinner after the premier predicted 300 hospital beds could go due to budget cuts.

Premier Mike Baird on Monday said NSW could lose 300 public hospital beds across the state as early as July if the proposed cuts to health and education funding announced in the federal budget go ahead.

"We have, of course, grave concerns about the impact upon our public health system of the closure of that many beds and the result for the people of NSW," Brett Holmes from NSW Nurses and Midwives' Association told ABC Radio on Tuesday.

Mr Holmes said 27,000 fewer people will have access to public hospitals beds over the year and up to 400 nursing jobs could be lost.

"This would have a devastating impact on nursing staff and the level of safe patient care they could provide to the community," he said in a statement.

The union wants clarification on where the beds would be closed and how many people would subsequently lose their jobs.

But its main concern is whether the state government will proceed with the planned cuts, Mr Holmes told AAP.

"Is it a real threat that they intended to carry out?" Mr Holmes wants to know, adding Mr Baird's claims could be "symbolic" or rhetorical, used to illustrate the federal budget's effect on NSW.

Ms Skinner later told AAP that federal budget health cuts would force NSW to "find further efficiencies".

"However, all beds will continue to be funded through the good financial management of the NSW government," she said.
