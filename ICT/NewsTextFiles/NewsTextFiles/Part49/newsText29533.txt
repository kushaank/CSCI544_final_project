
A man from (the southern U.S. state of)) Mississippi has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for sending letters dusted with the poison ricin to President Barack Obama and other public offices.

James Everett Dutschke pleaded guilty in January to possessing and mailing the threatening letters containing ricin - a natural and highly toxic compound extracted from castor beans.

Dutschke sent the letters to Mr. Obama, Republican U.S. Senator Roger Wicker and Mississippi judge Sadie Holland, in what prosecutors have said was an elaborate plot to frame another man ((Paul Kevin Curtis)).

The poisoned letters addressed to Mr. Obama and Wicker were intercepted before delivery, but one letter reached Judge Holland. She was not harmed.

Dutschke waived his right to appeal. He was not fined or ordered to pay restitution because officials say he does not have enough money.
