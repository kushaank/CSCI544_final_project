
NEW YORK (MYFOXNY) - Authorities say a Florida woman has been joyfully reunited with her daughter who went missing nearly five years ago, after the girl was located with her father in Mexico.

The Volusia County Sheriff's Office said Jodie Borchert of Deltona was reunited Saturday with her 12-year-old daughter in Miami, where the girl was transported after being located in Hidalgo, Mexico.

Authorities say the child's father, 55-year-old Aaron Cox, fled with the girl in August 2009 when she was 8-years-old.

Years went by with no leads until a tip came into the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children on Monday that revealed Cara Cox was spotted in Mexico.

In a joint effort spanning multiple agencies, Cara Cox was tracked down to a remote area in the mountains of Hidalgo, two hours outside of Mexico City.

On Friday, surveillance conducted in the area led to Aaron Cox’s arrest and the recovery of Borchert’s daughter.

Investigators learned that the pair had no known ties to Mexico and had been living under assumed names.
