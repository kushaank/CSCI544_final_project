
A man was shot dead Monday after getting into an argument with several men in a car as he walked with a friend near Orlando Regional Medical Center, police said.

The victim and his friend, who was not hurt, were near a parking garage steps from Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies about 8 p.m. when a white, newer-model Nissan four-door drove by, witnesses told investigators.

Words were exchanged, and then shots rang out from the car, which was occupied by three or four men, said Sgt. Jim Young, an Orlando police spokesman.

The men on foot had ducked for cover between parked cars on Lucerne Terrace north of Sturtevant Street, and the victim's friend pulled him into the street to try to get help from an Orange County Corrections Department van that was driving by.

The victim was taken to the Orlando Regional Medical Center emergency room, but he could not be saved. His name was not released because his family had not been notified.

Detectives late Monday were interviewing about a dozen witnesses, including several children, and combing the block where the shooting happened. Lucerne Terrace was closed between Sturtevant Street and Copeland Drive.
