
ARMED robber, Conference Ngwenya, who is serving a 21-year jail sentence for robbing Osiphatheleni, had every reason to smile after fresh robbery charges were dropped due to lack of evidence.

Ngwenya, 30, of house number 5566 Lobengula West was alleged to have robbed Wozani Butchery in Magwegwe and stole cash amounting to $65,000 at gun point in 2012.

In throwing out the charges against the accused, senior regional magistrate Judith Zuyu said evidence brought before the court by the witnesses was not convincing enough.

"The evidence presented to the court by the witnesses was not convincing enough because it did not link Ngwenya to the crime.

There were a lot disparities in the witnesses' evidence and as such this court finds you not guilty," said Zuyu.
