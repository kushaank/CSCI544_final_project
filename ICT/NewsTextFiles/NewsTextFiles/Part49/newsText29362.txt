The Central Valley’s 7 million acres of irrigated farmland are best known as the richest food-producing region in the world.

But a new study by UC Davis researchers forecasts severe socioeconomic impacts ahead in the area where many of the nation’s fresh fruits, nuts and vegetables are grown.

The drought could cost the region’s farm industry $1.7 billion in 2014 and cause more than 14,500 workers to lose their jobs, according to preliminary results of the study, which also predicts that Central Valley irrigators will only get two-thirds of their normal water deliveries.

Additional pumping of groundwater to replace those shortages will cost farmers about $450 million. About 410,000 acres, or 6%, of the irrigated cropland in the Central Valley will be fallowed this year.

The hardships imposed on Central Valley farming communities and the environment are not expected to threaten California’s overall economy.

The researchers used computer models and data from the State Water Project, the federal Central Valley Project and local water districts to chart the economic impacts of the 2014 drought in the Central Valley.

Later this year, the researchers plan to release a more comprehensive report of the drought’s economic impacts that will include coastal agriculture and updates on the Central Valley.
