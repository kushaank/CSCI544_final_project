
Sarah Palin wants to know why everyone is so upset about Karl Rove suggesting there’s something wrong with Hillary Clinton’s brain. In a Facebook post Monday, Palin argued that no one went easy on her during the 2008 presidential election so Clinton should expect the same treatment.

Linking to a Wall Street Journal article on the issue she evidently found on The Drudge Report, Palin mocked Rove’s critics.

“Hey! Hillary’s brain is off-limits! Leave her health records alone! Democrats are right – scouring records of a female candidate is just politics of personal destruction, and for the media to engage in it would be unfair, unethical, and absolutely UNPRECEDENTED. You can’t probe a woman like that because, well, it’s a war on women!

As proof that this isn’t the first time a (potential) female candidate’s health records have been mined for scandal, Palin posted links from POLITCO , Salon and elsewhere about the conspiracy theories surrounding her son Trig. During the 2008 election, rumors swirled that Palin’s youngest, who has Down syndrome, was actually Bristol Palin’s son.
