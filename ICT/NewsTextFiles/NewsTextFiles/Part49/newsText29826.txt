
The OK Grand Challenge Jackpot promotion promotion has sparked furore amongst its Mat'land shoppers with many accusing the competition of favouring Harare shoppers.

The grand prize of a Ford Ranger double cab can only be won by a someone who will be able to make it to Harare's Borrowdale Racecourse for the 7th of June grand draw.

Whilst coupons for other prizes other than the double cab can be deposited into entry boxes in OK stores nationwide, the OK Car draw coupon will only be deposited in Harare on the draw date.

This means outside Harare OK customers will have to travel to Harare for the draw if they entertain hopes of landing the grand prize.

Angry shoppers in Gwanda accused the leading retail outlet of regionalism saying the competition favored their Harare counterparts.

"Whilst it is understandable why the winner has to be present at the draw we think OK has the capacity to rotate venues for the draw every year, don't we have a racecourse in Bulawayo," quipped one shopper.

"This is a deliberate plot to eliminate us from the grand prize, obviously l wouldn't travel to Harare hoping to win the car.I think OK should stop giving us this coupon because it does not help us," said another shopper as he deposited other competition coupons.

OK workers failed to give satisfactory answers when quizzed by clients.

The grand prize in the OK promotion has on several occasions been won by Harare based customers.

The OK Grand Challenge Jackpot Promotion is one of the biggest competition in the Zimbabwe.

The 24th edition of the competition will see 25 vehicles being won this year.
