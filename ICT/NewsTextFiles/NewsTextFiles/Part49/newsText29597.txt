
PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) â€” A federal judge threw out Oregon's same-sex marriage ban Monday, marking the 13th legal victory for gay marriage advocates since the U.S. Supreme Court last year overturned part of a federal ban.

State officials earlier refused to defend Oregon's voter-approved ban and said they wouldn't appeal.

The National Organization for Marriage sought to intervene, but both U.S. District Judge Michael McShane in Eugene and a federal appeals court rejected its attempts to argue in favor of the ban.

Many county clerks in the state began carrying out same-sex marriages almost immediately after Monday's ruling, as jubilant couples rushed to tie the knot.

"It's the final step to be truly a family," said Patty Reagan, who waited in line in Portland to get a marriage license with partner Kelly. "Everyone else takes for granted that they have this right."

McShane joins judges in seven other states who have overturned same-sex marriage bans, though appeals are underway. Lower-court judges have repeatedly cited last year's Supreme Court ruling when striking down bans.

Opposition remains stiff in many places, with critics pointing out that most states still prohibit gay marriage.

The Oregon Family Council released a strongly worded statement Monday saying the state colluded with gay-rights groups to sidestep the will of voters, and a judge allowed it.
