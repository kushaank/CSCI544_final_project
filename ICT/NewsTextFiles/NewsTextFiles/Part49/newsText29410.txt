
TOPEKA, Kan. (WIBW) - The Kansas Expocentre general manager told county commissioners Monday the first lady's visit to the capital city went very smoothly.

H.R. Cook told county commissioners he's only the straw that stirs the drinks when it came to making Mrs. Obama's visit go so smoothly.

Cook acknowledged and thanked the Expocentre staff, the Public Works Department and the Shawnee County Parks and Recreation Department for all of their hard work.

He said he received an email Saturday from the White House staff thanking him.

"I cannot imagine the amount of time that you all put in, all the way into the first lady's visit to the number of graduations held and not an incident that I'm aware of or received an email on, nice job," said commissioner Shelly Buhler.

"It went flawlessly and I thank the county commission, the city of Topeka and 501 for allowing us to present the building in a manner that everybody can be proud of," said Cook.
