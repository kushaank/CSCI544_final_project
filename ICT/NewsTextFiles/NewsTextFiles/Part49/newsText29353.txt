University of Arkansas at Little Rock undergraduates carrying 30 credit hours would be charged $7,959, a 4.7 percent increase. The largest percentage increase would be at the University of Arkansas at Fort Smith, where an undergraduate taking 30 credit hours would pay $5,962, a 6 percent increase.

University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff students face the smallest percentage increase: 3.5 percent. Their undergraduate rate would be $5,956 if they take 30 credit hours. University of Arkansas at Monticello students would pay $6,082, a 5 percent increase.

Probably due to offering same-sex insurance benefits.

Tuition was $315 for 18 hours in my first semester, and believe me, it isn't worth a penny more than that. Scholarships prevented me from paying anything, and that's what it takes to get through school today. If you can't get a scholarship, go to a technical school and learn to be a welder, electrician, pipe fitter, heating and air conditioning technician, etc. You'll probably make more than most college grads anyway.
