
Twelve pastors were yesterday ordained to administer marriages and holy communions for the Congregational Christian Church of Samoa. The ceremony was held at Malua.

They had already graduated from the Theological College and been chosen to look after churches.

However, they weren’t given full authority for either ceremony until yesterday, when they were blessed by Reverend Elders of the church. They have now completed all that a pastor needs to look after their church.

Elder Reverend Popo Su’a encouraged them to always remember that this opportunity was given to them by God to fulfil His will and to serve Him.

Fear the Lord, Su’a told the pastors, obey Him and make sure that you have a big heart to do His work according to His will.

He warned the pastors that their powers were not absolute.
