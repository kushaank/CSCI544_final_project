
HANOI, Vietnam â€” A port official said two Chinese passenger ships have arrived at a central Vietnamese port to evacuate Chinese nationals following deadly rioting last week.

The official said the boats with a capacity of 1,000 passengers each arrived at Vung Ang early Monday.

He didn't give his name because he wasn't authorized to speak to the media.

Vung Ang port is part of a massive Taiwanese steel mill complex that was overrun by an anti-China mob last week.
