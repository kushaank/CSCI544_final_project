
JOINT BASE ELMENDORF-RICHARDSON, Alaska –  A woman has been hospitalized in stable condition after being attacked by a brown bear on an Anchorage military base.

The attack happened Sunday morning on Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.

Authorities say the woman and her husband were running on base. The woman got ahead of her husband, and encountered a sow with two cubs nearby.

She saw the bear and dropped to the ground, playing dead. Maj. Angela Webb says the bear came up to the woman and swiped at her with a paw. The woman was cut in several places.

Base officials have closed all recreational trails near the attack site as they investigate.
