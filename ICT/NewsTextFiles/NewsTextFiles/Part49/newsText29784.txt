
HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam - A Vietnam-EU free trade agreement is expected to boost exports on both sides.

The FTA, to be signed by October this year, is likely to improve prospects for business-people who wish to enter or remain in the markets.

While The EU is already the most important market for many of the exports of Vietnam, the Asian country will now enjoy the EU's Generalized System of Preferences, which provides preferential access to the EU market for developing countries through reduced tariffs.

EU officials have said even though the preferential tariffs will be reviewed every three years, Vietnam will now have a more predictable and stable legal framework for overseas market trade.

Under the initial FTA tariffs, most Vietnamese products exported to the EU will gradually drop to zero.

Vietnam has said it will increase its investments into business to improve product quality.
