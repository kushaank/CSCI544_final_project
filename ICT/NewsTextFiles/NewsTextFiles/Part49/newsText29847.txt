
BANGALORE: AICC vice-president Rahul Gandhi's attempt to introduce reforms in the party by holding US-style primaries to 15 Lok Sabha constituencies, including two in Karnataka, came a cropper.

All 15 candidates given tickets after they won primaries lost. The big names included Meenakshi Natarajan (Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh), Ajay Maken (New Delhi ), Krishna Tirath (North-West Delhi) and B Janardhan Poojary (Dakshina Kannada).

"The primaries were a farce in many constituencies and were tried at the last minute. Instead of uniting party workers, it led to groupism even before the candidates could start their campaigns. Along with the Modi wave, the candidates had to contend with an anti-Congress wave internally,'' a party leader said.

In Karnataka, primaries were held in Dakshina Kannada and Bangalore North constituencies. Winners in these primaries —Poojary and C Narayanaswamy — lost to BJP candidates by huge margins.

According to a Congress member, who lost the primaries, the entire exercise took a month. "Instead of connecting with voters in our constituencies, we were wooing the voters in the electoral college. When it came to holding the primaries, there were reports of an unsaid whip issued to workers to vote for a particular candidate,'' he said.

In Dakshina Kannada, the primary divided Congress workers into camps of Poojary and Union minister M Veerappa Moily, with the latter's son Harsha throwing his hat into the ring and later being rejected during scrutiny.

In Bangalore North, it resulted in a sharp divide between chief minister Siddaramaiah endorsing former Janata Parivar MP, who had joined the Congress just months ago and KPCC president G Parameshwara backing his political secretary G C Chandrashekar. The other contestants, IIMB faculty member M V Rajeev Gowda and former MLA N L Narendra Babu, had to fend for themselves.

This led to one-upmanship between Siddaramaiah and Parameshwara in which the former won but lost the bigger battle.
