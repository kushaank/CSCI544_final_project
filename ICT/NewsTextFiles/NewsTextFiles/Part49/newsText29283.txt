
Rep. Charles Van Zant, R-Keystone Heights,  garnered some attention  Monday for a video in which he said Florida's new state tests would promote homosexuality among children.

"These people that will now receive $220 million from the state of Florida unless this is stopped will promote double mindedness in state education, and attract every one of your children to become as homosexual as they possibly can," Van Zant said of the American Institutes for Research, which won the bid to design the state's new standards-based assessments.

As reported by  Politifact , AIR does research on LGBT youth issues. But the non-profit does not promote a gay or lesbian lifestyle.

The Florida Democratic Party wants Gov. Rick Scott to condemn Van Zant's remarks.

"All of Florida’s children have the right to grow up, go to school, and earn an education without fear of being judged for who they are," Chair Allison Tant said. "Anti-gay bullying has no place in the classroom, let alone in the Florida House."

1. STFU and retire!

2. Kids can be coerced into being gay? When did you choose to be a heterosexual? You didn't it's not a choice. It's embedded in your genes. Deal with it. And as in #1 STFU.
