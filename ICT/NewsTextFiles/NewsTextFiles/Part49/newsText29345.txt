
Mitt Romney wants the New Hampshire police commissioner who reportedly used a racial slur to describe President Barack Obama to step down, saying the public official "has no place in our community."

Romney, the former GOP presidential candidate, said in a statement, "The vile epithet used and confirmed by the commissioner has no place in our community: He should apologize and resign."

The former Massachusetts governor joins some political leaders and residents in the predominantly white New Hampshire town of Wolfeboro in calling for the resignation of Robert Copeland, according to The Associated Press.

A resident said she overheard the 82-year-old Copeland use a slur a restaurant in March and wrote to the town manager. Copeland, in an email to her, acknowledged using the slur in referring to the president and said he will not apologize.

Officials say resignation is the only way to get Copeland out of office before his three-year term expires.
