
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Cecil Garland, a Utah rancher who led a fight three decades ago to keep a missile system from being built in the western part of the state, has died. He was 88.

His wife Annette Garland says he died on May 11 from complications with pneumonia.

The couple lives near the tiny farming community of Callao, Utah close to the Nevada border. Cecil Garland is survived by four children and 10 grandchildren.

Garland led the campaign in 1979-1981 against the U.S. Air Force's proposal to build an MX missile system in Utah and Nevada.

He also fought against efforts by Nevada officials to take water from the region and route it to Las Vegas.

Annette Garland says she's proud of her husband's legacy.
