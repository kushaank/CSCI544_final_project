
Former Virginia senator Jim Webb, a Democrat, said in a radio interview Monday that he was considering whether to run for president. Webb, 68, is a combat veteran of the Vietnam War. He served as secretary of the Navy in the Reagan administration but in 2012 decided not to seek a second term in the U.S. Senate.

Webb went on to express concern about the direction of the country, both in national security abroad and in economic policy at home.
