
Earlier on Monday, the ninth circuit court of appeals denied a motion filed by an anti-gay marriage organization, National Organization for Marriage, to stay the judge’s decision pending an appeal, making the judge’s order effective immediately. “I believe that if we can look for a moment past gender and sexuality, we can see in these plaintiffs nothing more or less than our own families,” said Judge McShane in his opinion.

In 2013, four plaintiffs filed a suit to allow same-sex marriage in the state. Before Monday’s ruling only domestic partnerships were legal for gay and lesbian couples. The 2004 law, known as Measure 36, which effectively banned same-sex marriage in Oregon, was struck down as a result of McShane’s ruling.

One of the case’s plaintiffs said he was “thrilled” by the judge’s decision in a statement issued by the American Civil Liberties Union.

The Oregon ruling is the latest in a string of victories for same-sex couples looking to marry or have their marriages recognized in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 2013 ruling on gay marriage.
