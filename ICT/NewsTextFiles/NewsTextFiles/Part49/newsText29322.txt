
Georgia has repaid two years earlier than expected the nearly $1 billion federal loan used to help pay state unemployment insurance benefits since 2009.

Gov. Nathan Deal and Georgia Labor Commissioner Mark Butler reported jointly Monday the state sent a $62,490,887 final payment to the U.S. Department of Labor on May 14. The original projected payoff date was 2016.

While the loan principal has been repaid, a final interest payment of approximately $2.7 million will be due and paid by Sept. 30.

Georgiaâ€™s unemployment insurance trust fund had a balance of $1.3 billion in December 2007 when the recession began and unemployment stood at 5.1 percent. As the recession lingered, hundreds of thousands of Georgians lost their jobs and were unable to find new ones. By December 2009, the unemployment rate had more than doubled to 10.4 percent, the trust fund was depleted, and Georgia was forced to join more than 30 other states in borrowing from the federal government to pay state benefits. From the time of the first loan through March 2014, Georgia paid $3.9 billion in state unemployment insurance benefits.

The state unemployment insurance trust fund has a current balance of $355,827,774.
