
Air Mekong, Vietnam’s third privately owned carrier, must present plans by the end of this year spelling out how it will resume services as a passenger airline or will otherwise lose its license, the Ministry of Transport has ordered.

On March 1, 2013, debt-ridden Air Mekong officially announced its suspension for restructuring and faced license cancelation in March of this year, when the Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam (CAAV) requested that the carrier present new operation plans by the end of that month.

But the deadline has been extended to this year-end, the transport ministry said in a document released last weekend.

The extension came after Air Mekong lodged a proposal to CAAV in late April, asking to have more time to prepare its plans to resume operations in early 2015.

The transport ministry has also assigned CAAV to oversee the restructuring plan of Air Mekong and provide necessary guidance to help it resume services.

After December 31, 2014, should Air Mekong still fail to fly again, its license will be revoked.

Air Mekong is operated by Mekong Aviation Joint Stock Company, headquartered in the Mekong Delta province of Kien Giang. It is the third privately owned airline of Vietnam, after Indochina Airlines and VietJet Air.

VietJet Air is now the country’s only operational private carrier as Indochina Airlines, owned by Ha Hung Dung, commonly known as composer Ha Dung, lost its license in late 2010.
