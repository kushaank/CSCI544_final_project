
Gerald Horne, author of The Counter-Revolution of 1776, spoke at UCSB’s MultiCultural Center May 8.

Horne has written more than 30 books on the struggles of those marginalized throughout world history and is chair of History and African Studies at University of Houston. He believes that any study of the African slave trade in the United States should start the story a decade earlier than customary. His book, “unlike previous scholarship in this realm,” he said, “does not begin in the 1770s because that’s part of the problem. When you start on July 4, 1776, you distort the story.” Citing the historical evidence of slave trade development and slave revolt, Horne explained his thesis that the American Revolution was sparked by the feeling in the colonies that London would soon be imposing abolition upon them. Ironically, one of the freedoms the founding fathers sought was the freedom to hold slaves, according to Horne.

He went through the slave trade timeline internationally and discussed how, prior to 1776, more Africans were taking up arms with the British military, which led to the strengthening of anti-slavery sentiments in England. Horne said the many slave rebellions in Jamaica and Antigua made American colonists fear they would spread to their farms and plantations as well.

Horne’s take on the American Revolution as a pro-slavery “counter-revolution” puts a nice twist on the history of America. He ended his lecture by connecting the prevalence of racism today and the hidden history of the United States.

WOW, I'm so shocked, I thought all the Founding Fathers were champions of racial equality.

I'm so glad there are people such as Mr. Horne and the UCSB Multicultural Center to deprogram my racist mind.
