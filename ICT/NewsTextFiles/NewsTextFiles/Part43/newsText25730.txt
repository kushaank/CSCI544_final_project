
MANILA, Philippines – Senator Teofisto Guingona III on Monday postponed “to a later date” the investigation on the P900-million Malampaya fund scam as Commission on Audit Chairman Ma. Grace Pulido-Tan would be unavailable on Thursday’s hearing.

“The Senate Blue Ribbon Committee's probe this Thursday on the Malampaya Fund anomalies will be postponed to a later date,” Guingona said in a media advisory.

Guingona announced late last week that the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee he heads will start its investigation on the role of alleged pork barrel scam mastermind Janet Lim-Napoles in the alleged misuse of the P900-million Malampaya funds for the supposed benefit of agrarian reform beneficiaries.

He said the Senate panel wants to know the participation of fake nongovernmental organizations owned and controlled by Napoles in the embezzlement of the funds identified by Benhur Luy in his earlier testimony before the blue-ribbon committee.

News accounts indicate that Napoles-created NGOs received funds from the first P900-million tranche of Palawan’s share of the Malampaya funds.

Luy said most of the NGOs engaged in “ghost deliveries” of goods intended for project beneficiaries.

And while a few deliveries were indeed made, he said the goods were usually overpriced.
