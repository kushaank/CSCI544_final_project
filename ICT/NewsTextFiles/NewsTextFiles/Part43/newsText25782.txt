
[Monday, May 19, 2014] Israeli soldiers uprooted hundreds of trees that belong to members of various families of Nahhalin village, west of the West Bank city of Bethlehem.

The WAFA news agency said the soldiers invaded the Wad Salem Area (Salem Valley), north of the village, before cutting and uprooting hundreds of almond trees.

Ibrahim Shakarna, head of the Local Council in Nahhalin, stated that the attack is part of ongoing Israeli military violations, and repeated attacks carried out by extremist Israeli settlers.

Shakarna told WAFA that the attacks include bulldozing farmlands and uprooting trees, in addition to flooding Palestinian orchards and farmlands with sewage water and toxins.

On Sunday, Israeli settlers caused the death of 14 sheep after placing grass mixed with toxins in a grazing area, used by Palestinian shepherds in the al-Hadeediyya village, in the Northern Plains of the occupied West Bank.
