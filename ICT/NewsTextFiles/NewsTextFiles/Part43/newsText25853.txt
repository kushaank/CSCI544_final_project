
Qatar's financial regulator said on Sunday it has withdrawn authorisation for an independent investment advisory firm to operate in Qatar Financial Centre (QFC).

The QFC Regulatory Authority announced that it has taken formal regulatory action against Concordia Capital.

"This action was taken due to Concordia's failure to meet its capital and financial resource requirements after being provided with reasonable time to correct its non-compliance but failing to do so," said a statement issued by the regulator.

It added: "As a result, Concordia is no longer authorised to conduct financial services in or from the QFC."

According to its LinkedIn profile page, Concordia Capital is an independent investment advisory firm owned by prominent Qatari investors.

It said the management of the company has closed more than $20 billion of deals in their careers in Europe, the Gulf and Asia.

Michael Ryan, CEO of the QFC Regulatory Authority said: "Capital and financial resources requirements are among the most important pillars of the regulatory framework that protect clients and the integrity and reputation of the QFC.

"It is critical that firms conducting financial services meet these requirements in order to conduct business in a sound manner and to contribute towards maintaining the stability of the QFC."
