
MOSCOW, May 19  -- Russia started withdrawing troops from regions bordering Ukraine on Monday in an apparent effort to ease tensions between Moscow and Kiev.

"Due to completion of the planned spring drills at the training ranges in Rostov, Belgorod and Bryansk regions, President Vladimir Putin ordered the defense minister to return the troops to their permanent bases," the Kremlin press service said.

The Kremlin also said Putin welcomed the first contacts between Kiev authorities and militant leaders in Ukraine's eastern regions, stressing that all sides of the dispute must participate in direct dialogue.

On May 25, Ukraine will hold early presidential elections, which the eastern regions of Donetsk and Lugansk have refused to recognize.

The two regions proclaimed independence from Kiev on May 11 following referendums which followed the example of the March referendum in Crimea, where a large majority supported the peninsula separating from Ukraine and joining Russia, a move not recognized by Kiev and the West.
