
Our attention has been drawn to the above captioned piece in The Sun Newspaper by one Willy Eya.  Our immediate reaction to it is that Bafarawa”s hatchet writers are at it again, in an attempt to justify his joining the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).

While we do not see anything wrong in Bafarawa getting a lifeline from the Presidency and shifting ground to where he feels he can have people at his beck and call, we shall not tolerate a deliberate falsehood being bandied around in order to make their benefactor a credible personality.

Perhaps, out of ignorance or attempt to skew up facts to achieve a goal, Willy Eya contended that Obasanjo made it possible for Governor Aliyu Wamakko to win the 2007 election by foisting him on the PDP. This claim is not only false but also mischievous. Rather than Wamakko being lucky to join PDP, it was PDP, which became the major beneficiary because before then it has no single elected person at the state or national.

Wamakko was convinced by former President Obasanjo to join PDP in order to improve PDP fortune and profile in the state; and Obasanjo/PDP came to that decision because they were told that the good people of Sokoto voted for ANPP, as it were, because of Wamakko, as Bafarawa’s deputy, and not the other way. If Willy is in doubt, luckily Baba and some of those that brokered the deal to have Wamakko join PDP are still alive.

Another thing that Willy Eya needs to know is that Bafarawa had to run away from ANPP then because Wamakko wrestled the structure of the party from him. With nowhere to go, Bafarawa founded the defunct DPP.

As a result of Wamakko’s popularity, PDP got 100 per cent in Sokoto ranging from local councils, state, and national. Sokoto became the only state with such a record due to Wamakko’s unprecedented popularity and followership. Willy, the fact remain that, Wamakko trounced Bafarawa three times at the polls between 2007 and 2012 and will trounce him again in 2015. Maybe after 2015, you and the world will be fully convinced that Bafarawa is not only unpopular but is despised by the good people of Sokoto. His election victory in 1999 was because Wamakko decided to go with him as a running mate. Please come to Sokoto and conduct an honest investigation devoid of interference. Publish what you get if you have the courage.

Bafarawa”s defection did not come as a surprise to many people in Sokoto. It has been expected for two reasons. First, he needed rehabilitation. Secondly, he prefers where he will be calling the shots since Wamakko, as a sitting governor, would not cow tow to him. For those of us who know Bafarawa very well, we know he must lead and his words are gospel.

The best option was the one he chose. No one cares where Bafarawa goes, and Sokoto people will not lose sleep because he went to a party, that today, is regarded as comatose.

We look forward to 2015 because by the grace of God it is history that will repeat itself. All those who gave Bafarawa political-confidence throughout his career are now in Wamakko”s camp. The who is who list includes but not limited to his former commissioners, former deputy, former DPP governorship candidate, Alhaji Maigari Dingyadi, former party executives at both state and local governments. Now tell the world what impact Bafarawa, under PDP-umbrella, will make in 2015, after losing all these significantly important allies? Though we know he is banking on the incumbency of President Goodluck Jonathan, Sokoto people are never known to be cowards and do not succumb to intimidation.

Please, carefully read this information till the end and select any one you like.
