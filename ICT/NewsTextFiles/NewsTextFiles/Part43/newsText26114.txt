
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has called on the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the United Nations to ensure an "open and impartial" probe by Kiev into deaths that occurred in the Ukrainian city of Odessa this month, the Foreign Ministry said on Monday.

At least 37 people in the southern Ukrainian port city died after a riot on May 2 ended with dozens of pro-Russian protesters being trapped in a burning building.
