
CHICAGO, May 19, 2014 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Fitch Ratings has placed all of the credit ratings of CFR Pharmaceuticals S.A. and its subsidiary CFR International SpA on Rating Watch Positive. A complete list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.

Today's action follows the announcement that Abbott Investments Luxembourg S.A.R.L., a subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories (Abbott; 'A+') has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 72.62% of CFR's issued and outstanding shares from its controlling shareholder and will conduct a public cash tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of CFR. Assuming all publicly-held shares are tendered, the total purchase price would be approximately $2.9 billion, plus the assumption of net debt of approximately $430 million. The acquisition is subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals.

Fitch expects the transaction to be approved by regulatory officials and to close during the second half of 2014 at which time the Rating Watch Positive will be resolved. Assuming the transaction is consummated on the agreed upon terms, the outcome is expected to result in at least a one-notch upgrade of CFR's long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured debt. The upgrade could be significantly more than one notch if CFR's debt is guaranteed by Abbott and if it integrates CFR both financially and operationally.

Fitch believes Abbott's acquisition of CFR makes sense strategically, as it would increase Abbott's already strong position in the fast growing Latin American branded-generic pharmaceutical market. Developing markets such as Latin America are expected to provide the bulk for growth for this product segment. Abbott expects CFR to contribute approximately $900 million to its annual sales by 2015. The acquisition does pose some integration risk, but Abbott has stated that the financial success of this acquisition does not rely on anticipated significant cost synergies.
