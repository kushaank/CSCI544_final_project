Sure, except she spoke Friday at a televised meeting of artists in Pyongyang and thanked her powerful ex for supporting the arts, the Los Angeles Times reports. Hyon Song Wol, a pop star , was reportedly one of as many as a dozen people executed by firing squad last year for acting in porno videos sold in China, according to South Korea's Chosun Ilbo. Even Japan's Asahi Shimbun paper joined in, saying the performers were killed to stop lurid rumors from getting out about the lifestyle of Kim Jong Un's wife, Ri Sol Ju, when she was an entertainer, the Telegraph reports.

They claimed it was an anti-aircraft gun firing squad.

Those same reporters probably forward Facebook posts that claim Bill Gates will pay them for it.
