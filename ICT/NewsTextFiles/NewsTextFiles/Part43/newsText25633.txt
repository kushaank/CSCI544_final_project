Located north-west of the Hunza River, the mountainous Hunza Valley in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan is known for its beautifully scenic location and friendly people.

Perhaps a little known fact about it is its excellent literacy rate. Unlike the national average, which in 2007-2008 hovered around 56 per cent, the literacy rate in Hunza Valley is remarkably around 90 per cent. Perhaps this is why an organisation in that region was so receptive to the ideas of Pakistani female IT entrepreneur, Maria Umar.

As the founder and President of the Womenâ€™s Digital League in Pakistan, Maria shares an inspiring success story that took place in Karimabad, the capital city of Hunza, involving the Karakoram Area Development Organization (KADO).

Although Mariaâ€™s conservative family took some time to warm up to her new vocation, she is very thankful for their support in helping her overcome cultural norms, â€œIt took me three years to convince the men in my family. Three years ago I wasnâ€™t even allowed to post my picture online, but today I travel to the USA alone thanks to their open mindedness.â€� Maria, who is originally from Peshawar, started with no investment aside from her computer and a UPS (uninterruptible power supply). Eventually, she created The Womenâ€™s Digital League, an all-women virtual company that today carries a strong reputation as an IT firm. The Womenâ€™s Digital League not only provides excellent services to its clients, but also trains rural women in the field of IT.

What Maria hates more than anything is when women act as helpless victims and make excuses. She acknowledges that Pakistani women face challenges in the IT field, â€œThe biggest problem for female entrepreneurs in the IT field is finance. While women get the mentors, men get the money. The financial institutions just donâ€™t have the same type of faith in women.

Although Maria feels that such women need assistance, she believes they need to stand up and be counted, â€œThe problem is at the grassroots level. While the little boys at school are studying science and math, little girls are encouraged to be good at language and arts. That being said, women shouldnâ€™t make excuses. Everything is the same for both genders.

Police official Nazeer Ahmed told Dawn that militants had planted explosives inside the shrine of Sheikh Taqi Baba.

What a wonderful story. We are proud of you Maria.

some good news, Dawn we need more such inspiring stories.

Awesome work Maria, despite the trials and tribulations you faced you persevered! Good for you and for the many whom you're helping achieve success in the IT world.

One point I must respectfully disagree with, " While the little boys at school are studying science and math, little girls are encouraged to be good at language and arts. " If this were true which the West has been harping on and IMO is a myth. Why? If this was the case, then Pakistan wouldn't have physicians, astro physic scientists, molecular biologists,code writing geniuses, chemical, electrical and civil engineers, etc., who are all females and many who began these careers during Pakistan's early formation. One of these happens to be my great aunt who was awarded a physics scholarship to study at Cambridge university in the 1950's.

Pakistan has always been pro education, it just depends on how strong family support is in advocating for their daughters and sons advanced education. Just as Maria states, her conservative family finally realized what a valuable contribution she made through hard work to get to where she is and in time did " see the light " and are now very proud of her. Sometimes it takes sheer guts to get to where one needs to be, and for Maria she certainly achieved her dream career and is now helping her community which is admirable.

Information Technology is one where virtual universe exist. IT makes it possible to work remotely no matter where you live, you just need a working computer machine and an internet connection for communication with team members and specially as a task submission resource.
