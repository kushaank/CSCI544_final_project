
MOSCOW, May 19 (RIA Novosti) â€“ Rescuers from the Russian Emergency Ministry working in flood-hit Serbia have evacuated nearly 100 people in a single day, a representative of the Russian crisis office at the site of the disaster told RIA Novosti.

"Some 96 people, including 28 children, have been taken out of the flooded areas over the past day," the representative said.

Russian rescuers have evacuated more than 2,000 people, including 604 children, since the worst flood in a century hit Serbia last week.

The rain that caused the flood has now stopped, but overflowing rivers remain dangerous.

Serbia, as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina, declared a state of emergency in most areas of the country. On Thursday, Serbia asked Russia and the European Commission for humanitarian aid.

Russia dispatched its aid to Serbia on Friday, as well as 72 world-class rescuers, 10 lifeboats and other equipment. The Russian rescue team is working under the command of the ministry's military expert Eduard Chizhikov.
