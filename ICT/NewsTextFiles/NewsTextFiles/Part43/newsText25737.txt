
A fugitive in the United States of America for the last ten years prefers Dumaguete City as his retirement and hiding place, but not without the long arms of the law.

U.S. citizen Thomas Robert Snyder, 67 years old, who hails from the State of Illinois, was arrested on Tuesday, May 13, 2014  in one of the local restaurants in Piapi, Dumaguete City by agents from the U.S. Embassy and US State Department, Diplomatic Security Personnel together with two immigration officers, upon the authority of the warrant for Parole Violation for Sexual Assault, and for violation of Philippine immigration laws.

Snyder had been transferring residences from one place to another, from the Cafino Apartment in sitio Madasigon, Banilad, and recently at Pi√±ero Subdivison in Mangnao.

According to NBI agent Nicanor Tagle, who was assigned on the case,  U.S. authorities had requested  NBI Dumaguete agent-in-charge Alvin Rebadulla to assist in the search of the fugitive.

They have been looking for Snyder in different parts of the country for the last ten years, and was finally located in the city following an extensive search conducted by NBI Dumaguete headed by Agent Rebadulla.

The U.S. fugitive, who is believed to be a pedophile, was convicted in 1994 by the State of Oregon for sexually molesting two male minors.  He was sentenced to suffer an imprisonment of 22 years, but was released on parole ten years later.

However, he violated the parole condition upon leaving the United States for the Philippines in 2004, and has been declared a fugitive since then.

Snyder stayed in Metro Manila for two years; another five years in Mindoro and the last three years in Dumaguete City, where he has been reported to be with male minors.
