MANILA, Philippines â€“ Alleged pork barrel scam mastermind Janet Napoles may be itching to be freed from detention, but a recent Court of Appeals (CA) resolution is making her wait.

In a two-page resolution dated May 14 but released to the media Monday, May 19, the CA Special Seventh Division instead asked scam whistleblower Benhur Luy and the judge hearing his serious illegal detention case against Napoles to comment on her petition to post bail for her temporary liberty.

Luy and Makati Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 150 Presiding Judge Elmo Alameda were asked to file their respective comments on Napoles' plea 10 days from their receipt of the notice from the court.

Napoles' petition before the appellate court was filed last April 10, after Judge Alameda denied Napoles' initial plea before the Makati RTC to be allowed to post bail. Alameda also subsequenly rejected her appeal.

The CA resolution was penned by Associate Justice Noel Tijam and was concurred by Associate Justices Priscilla Baltazar-Padilla and Edwin Sorongon.

Napoles and Reynald Lim have been accused of trying to detain Luy against his will starting December 2012. Luy was rescued by National Bureau of Investigation agents in one of Napoles' Pacific Plaza Tower units on March 22, 2013.
