In the statement, the UN chief also assured the DPRK government of "his and the United Nations' solidarity and offer of assistance. "

The DPRK's official KCNA news agency said on Sunday that an apartment in the Pyongchon District in Pyongyang collapsed on May 13, saying that improper construction and irresponsible supervision of the high-rise construction were responsible for the disaster.

The KCNA said rescue operations came to an end on Saturday, but it gave no other details such as the number of casualties.
