
RUSSIAN President Vladimir Putin on Monday ordered troops deployed near Ukraine to return to their home bases and praised the launch of a dialogue between the Ukrainian government and its opponents even as fighting continued in the eastern parts of the country.

Mr Putin specifically ordered Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu to pull back forces involved in “planned spring drills” in the Rostov, Belgorod and Bryansk regions to their home bases, the Kremlin said. The order appears to go further than a similar statement by the Russian leader two weeks ago that troops were being pulled back from the border to shooting ranges.

The three regions border Ukraine and the withdrawal of troops deployed there to other Russian provinces would signal a genuine attempt by Moscow to de-escalate the worst crisis in its relations with the West since the Cold War. It also would be easily verifiable by Western intelligence.

The United States and NATO said they saw no sign of a pullout after Mr Putin’s earlier claim of a withdrawal, and NATO on Monday said it didn’t see any immediate movements to validate the latest assertions.

The Kremlin statement didn’t say how many troops would be pulled out from the three regions or specify how quick the withdrawal would be.

Mr Putin’s move appears to represent an attempt to ease tensions with the West and avoid another round of crippling sanctions. The US and the European Union have slapped travel bans and asset freezes on members of Mr Putin’s entourage over Russia’s annexation of Crimea. They threatened to target entire sectors of the Russian economy with sanctions if Russia tries to derail Ukraine’s presidential vote set for Sunday.

Pro-Russian rebels, who have seized government buildings in eastern Ukraine and fought government troops, have declared two sprawling provinces independent and vowed to block Sunday’s vote. Ukraine and the West have accused Russia of fomenting the mutiny, claims Russia has denied.

Facing Western pressure, Mr Putin supported a peace plan for settling the crisis, which was brokered by the Swiss chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

The OSCE road map aims to halt the violence and de-escalate tensions ahead of the vote, by offering an amnesty for those involved in the unrest and urging talks on decentralisation and the status of the Russian language. The OSCE also has sent an observer mission for the election.

Even though the Russian Foreign Ministry has criticised the round tables for failing to include the government’s foes, Putin welcomed them as an attempt to establish dialogue.

Mr Putin and Mr Lavrov urged the Ukrainian authorities to immediately end a military operation in eastern Ukraine, where fighting continued on Monday. Pro-Russian insurgents fired on a Ukrainian army checkpoint near a television tower outside the eastern city of Slovyansk, killing one soldier and wounding three, Ukraine’s defence ministry said.

AP journalists also witnessed mortar fire hitting the village of Andriyivka, just outside Slovyansk. While it was impossible to confirm who fired the mortars, the shelling appeared to come from the Ukrainian government troops’ positions, damaging a gas main running across a field and onto local residents’ lands. The pipeline caught fire, but no residents were hurt.

Slovyansk has been the epicentre of fighting between Ukrainian troops and pro-Russian insurgents, who have seized government buildings across the east.

Ukraine’s central government has urged rebels to lay down arms and sit down for talks, but they say they are only prepared to discuss the withdrawal of government troops.

Amid the tensions, Ukraine and Russia traded accusations over two Russian journalists, who were arrested by Ukrainian forces near Slovyansk on Sunday.

The Ukrainian military said the two men, who had press accreditation with Life News, a Kremlin-connected TV channel, were with pro-Russian insurgents and were filming preparations for an attack outside Slovyansk. Russia has protested the arrest and asked the OSCE to assist their release.
