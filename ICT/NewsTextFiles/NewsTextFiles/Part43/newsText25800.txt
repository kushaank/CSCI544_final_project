
KHARTOUM: Sudanese authorities have refused to register a political party based on the ideas of a Muslim activist who was hanged for apostasy, his daughter said yesterday.

Asma Mahmud Muhammad Taha had sought official permission to revive the Republican Party of Mahmoud Muhammad Taha, who was hanged on January 18, 1985 under the regime of former president Jaafar Nimeiri.

She said that the Political Parties Affairs Council gave the party preliminary approval but then reversed its decision after hardline Islamists objected that “these people are apostates”.

Mohammed Adam Ismail, secretary general of the Council, said the denial was based “on pure legal grounds” although some people had voiced objection to it.

“They didn’t meet all the requirements,” Ismail said.

Although the Republicans lack official sanction, Asma Mahmud said they are carrying out their activities anyway. “We are going to have this right, no matter what,” she said. Before he was hanged, Taha had criticised Nimeiri’s imposition of Islamic Shariah law which imposed amputations and other harsh punishments.
