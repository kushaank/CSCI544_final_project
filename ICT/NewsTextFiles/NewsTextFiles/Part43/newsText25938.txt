
Dr. Mario Rubin , who took over as medical director of the Saint Luke's Hospital kidney transplant program in April, resigned the position after less than a month on the job.

Saint Luke's announced his appointment on April 3 , and a spokeswoman said he submitted his resignation April 24.

"When Dr. Rubin arrived on site it became clear to both parties that the employment was not a good fit from either the perspective of Dr. Rubin or Saint Luke's Health System ," Laurel Gifford , director of media relations, wrote in a statement.

"Saint Luke's remains strongly committed to its transplant program and care has continued uninterrupted led by a team of highly skilled abdominal transplant specialists," she said. "Saint Luke's is dedicated to its abdominal transplant program and to providing the highest level of medical care to its patients."

The hospital previously suspended temporarily its liver transplant program following the departure of director Dr. Henry Randall . Randall has filed a lawsuit against the hospital and a number of doctors claiming that he was fired unjustly amid a "turf war" over patients.
