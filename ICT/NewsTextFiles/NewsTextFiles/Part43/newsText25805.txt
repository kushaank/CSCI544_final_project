
Hundreds of Hawaii Republicans from around the state gathered to get "Back to Basics" in Kaneohe.

That was the theme for the annual state convention for the GOP Saturday at the Koolau Ballrooms.

Party members adopted various resolutions, including one opposing state-fund pre-schools. Another called for the end of the controversial "Pono Choices" sex education program.

The convention was the Hawaii GOPs first major event since former Congresswoman Pat Saiki took over as chair in March.

"We as the Republican party want to offer candidates who, when elected, can offer changes, more imaginative ideas, new solutions to old issues," said Saiki.

Former Lt. Gov. James "Duke" Aiona also addressed the convention.

""The people in Hawaii have lost respect for their elected officials and that's because our elected officials very sadly failed to give them respect, and as such I think it's pretty apparent right now that there's a real imbalance in our government," he told Hawaii News Now.

Aiona is expected to officially declare himself a GOP candidate for governor Monday. Gov. Neil Abercrombie and Sen. David Ige are squaring off in the Democratic primary, while former Honolulu Mayor Mufi Hannemann is running for governor as an Independent.
