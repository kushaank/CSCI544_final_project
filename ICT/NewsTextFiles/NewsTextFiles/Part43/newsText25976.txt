
John Brumby, the former Labor premier of Victoria, says raising the rate or broadening the base of the GST is now “inevitable” . Speculation about an increase in the GST above its present level of 10 per cent has been around since John Howard announced it during his first term. And speculation about broadening its base to food and essential services has existed ever since those items were removed in a compromise to get it through the senate.

The present round of GST speculation was sparked when the Abbott government, apparently without consultation , cut $80 billion in funding to the states for health and education spending. At the end of last century, the states tied their fortunes to the GST by agreeing to axe many of their own taxes in exchange for all of the GST revenue. Now it seems that the only way forward for the states is to agitate for a GST hike.

As much as it needs to be inevitable from the states’ point of view, it’s not. The Greens won’t support it, so even if the Coalition were to take it to the 2016 election and win, it would need the support of Labor to get it through the senate. For the moment, federal Labor is opposed. Surely nothing is inevitable in politics: not the republic, not same-sex marriage, and certainly not the increase in a regressive tax that disproportionately impacts low-income earners.

It may be that the government’s $80 billion cut to state funding is less about forcing the GST issue and more about bringing forward an urgent, much broader, discussion about federalism itself. Abbott argued in Battlelines that the federation is “dysfunctional” – he’s been repeating that theme in recent days – and that the solution is even greater centralisation.

"[Tony Abbott's] net approval is minus 28%, a massive 21 point fall, after a budget that people see as unfair, bad for Australia and bad for them personally – although they were equally divided on whether it is economically responsible."
