
BEIJING: Chinese authorities blamed an April railway attack in Xinjiang on an Islamist extremist group, state media said yesterday, reinforcing Beijing’s claims that separatist militants are provoking domestic unrest.

Beijing says it faces an increase in terrorism from a violent separatist movement there, driven by religious extremism and foreign groups.

“Notorious terrorist group the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM) was behind the fatal attack,” the official news agency Xinhua reported, citing police.

China’s top security official previously described ETIM as “behind-the-scenes supporters” of a deadly October attack on tourists in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square.

Critics claim the threat posed by such groups is exaggerated to justify hard-line measures, and instead point to cultural and religious repression and resentment that economic development has mostly benefited an influx of ethnic Han.

The two people who carried out the bombing died and the remaining eight have been arrested, it said.

A group named the Turkestan Islamic Party (TIP) released a video online showing the construction of a briefcase bomb allegedly used in the attack, the US-based SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist organisations, said last Tuesday.

But in response to that, several analysts said they doubted whether the TIP had the ability to launch such attacks, suggesting that it could be looking to raise its profile.

Little is known about ETIM and TIP, and experts are divided over whether the two groups are part of the same organisation.
