
PHUKET: DNA results that arrived in Phuket over the weekend confirm that a body found in the Phuket countryside is that of missing Russian Alexei Slabinskiy.

The body was found on March 29 in a badly decayed condition, dumped in a patch of scrub in the Baan Rieng area.

Pol Lt Peerajit Noopayon of Cherng Talay Police confirmed to The Phuket News today that DNA from the body shows a close match with DNA taken from his sister, Tatiana Novoselova.

Lt Peerajit said the DNA results were confirmed by dental matching with records from a clinic where Mr Slabinsky had dental treatment.

Apart from the DNA and dental tests, the Police Forensics Laboratory in Bangkok also carried out an autopsy to establish the cause of his death.

“The forensic laboratory confirmed that he was killed by a blow to his face with a blunt object,” Lt Peerajit said.

Mr Slabinskiy disappeared on March 7, believed to have been kidnapped by two other Russians on Phuket.

Even before the body was found, a hunt was launched for the suspected abductors, Aleksandr Novichkov and Andrei Zabelin, a rogue Russian Navy officer wanted in his home country for large-scale theft of Navy provisions.

Police believe both men have managed to get out of Thailand. Interpol and the Russian police have been alerted.

The reasons for Mr Slabinskiy's abduction and murder are still not clear. One theory is that he fell foul of Russian loan sharks. Another is that he may have been involved in ripping off a rich Russian in a property deal.

With his death and the escape of his abductors, the truth may never be known.
