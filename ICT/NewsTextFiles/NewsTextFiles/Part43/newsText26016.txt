
The British were due to invade Moscow via the Volga this summer with a boatload of culture. But the winds have turned. The project, called the Fine Arts Sails regatta, involved canvas sails being designed by British creatives including Julian Opie and graffiti artist Ben Eine. The boats were then due to head to Russia.

Now organiser and property tycoon Michael Ross has said it won’t happen because of rising tensions between the UK and Russia over Ukraine.

It was due to occur in parallel with the British Council’s UK-Russia Year of Culture 2014, which will see them sending us Malevich paintings and us sending the Young British Artists’ back catalogue to Russia.

No one seems to object to this.
