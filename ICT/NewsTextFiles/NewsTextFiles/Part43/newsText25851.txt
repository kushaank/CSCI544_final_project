
Deutsche Bank AG, Germanyâ€™s biggest bank, said it sold 60 million shares to the Qatari royal family amid its pursuit to raise as much as 8 billion euros of capital.

The bank raised 1.75 billion euros after selling a share at a price of 29.20 euros, while pledged to gather another 6.3 billion euros in a rights offer next month.

The main purpose of raising capital is to cut balance sheet and enhance finances before the ECB banks tests.
