
Researchers think that new varieties could help cut costs and improve yields during droughts.

Investigators at Peru’s National Agricultural Innovation Institute (INIA) in the northern region of Lambayeque are looking for ways to help farmers weather periods of drought.

According to Andina news agency, the INIA’s researchers are working on ways to both strengthen corn varieties against droughts as well as to cut production costs.

Andina reports that some of the INIA’s new precision farming tactics could bring costs down from approximately S/. 7,700 per hectare to just S/. 4,500.

Injante Silva said that the INIA’s work with hybrid corns has produced impressive results. “Right now, the INIA has a hyrbid that’s spurring a technological boom, it’s a megahybrid that’s surpassing yields, for example, in Pativilca, we’re seeing 16 tons per hectare, and on the northern coast it produces 14 tons. This is something we’ve never seen in this country, which is why farmers are betting on this variety,” said Injante Silva.
