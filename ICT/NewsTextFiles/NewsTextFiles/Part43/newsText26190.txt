
MOSCOW (AP) - NATO's chief is again saying there's no sign that Russia is pulling its troops back from the border with Ukraine.

Russian President Vladimir Putin today ordered troops deployed near Ukraine to return to their home bases. And he praised the launch of a dialogue between Ukraine's government and its opponents. But he spoke as fighting continued in the eastern part of Ukraine.

The Kremlin said Putin specifically ordered the country's defense minister to pull back forces involved in what were called "planned spring drills" to their home bases. The order appeared to go further than a similar statement by the Russian leader two weeks ago that troops were being pulled back from the border to shooting ranges.

The Kremlin statement didn't say how many troops would be pulled back from the three regions along the border with Ukraine, or how quick the withdrawal would be.

NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said today that the military alliance has "not seen any evidence at all that the Russians have started withdrawal of troops from the Ukrainian border."

He says NATO remains open to a political dialogue with Moscow.

Putin's move appears to represent an attempt to ease tensions with the West and avoid another round of sanctions.
