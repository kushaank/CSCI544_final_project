
Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister Peter O'Neill says he agrees with the Australian Government's decision to abolish Australia's aid agency, AusAID.

At the opening of the Australia PNG Business Forum in Cairns, Mr O'Neill also praised the Abbott Government's new aid agenda in the region.

"I told Prime Minister Abbott and his Foreign Minister Julie Bishop when they visited Papua New Guinea recently that we welcomed this step with a lot of enthusiasm," he said.

Mr O'Neill said the decision to cut AusAID is one of the most important changes to take place in PNG's increasingly strong relationship with Australia.

He said the move meant Australia's development assistance could better align with PNG priorities.

At the forum, Ms Bishop said Australian aid is undergoing a paradigm shift, including allowing up to 50 per cent of aid to PNG to go to agreed infrastructure projects.

"I am pleased to confirm that productivity-enhancing infrastructure is an agreed priority for the aid program in the years ahead," she said.

International aid groups have criticised recent cuts to Australia's foreign aid following the release of the Federal Budget this month.

The Australian Government will cut spending in the area by $7.6 billion over the next five years.

However, there has been an increase to aid to Papua New Guinea in return for hosting the Manus Island immigration processing centre.

Last September, Mr Abbott announced AusAID would be merged into the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

At the time World Vision Australia's chief executive, Tim Costello, criticised the decision.

"Once you mix it up with our trade and diplomatic goals, you lose a focus on what aid is," he said.

"The reason you have free-standing aid agencies that aren't subsumed under foreign affairs agencies is because you want clarity that aid is actually to deal with absolute poverty."
