
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif has given approval for restructuring of Pakistan Railway's Board.

The new board will enjoy powers to take important development and financial decisions, including procurement, PSDP proposals and agreements. It is pertinent to note that the existing board of Pakistan Railway is dysfunctional since 2002.

Pakistan Railway has witnessed significant improvement in its systems during last year, which also include better traveling facilities to passengers, rehabilitation of tracks, induction of new locomotives and initiation of mega projects.
