
THE City Government of Davao has allocated around P30 million for the rehabilitation of drainage systems in Barangays 22, 23 and 37-B.

Task Force Drainage chief Retired Colonel Yusof Jimlani, who was a guest in Monday's edition of Kapehan sa Dabaw at The Annex of SM City Davao, said P20 million will go to Barangays 22 and 23 while P10 million will go to Barangay 37-B.

Jimlani said Mayor Rodrigo Duterte requested P30 million from third district Representative Isidro Ungab and the regional office of the the Department of Public Works and Highways for the project.

He said they are eyeing to begin the rehabilitation in Barangays 22 and 23, which share a drainage system, as soon as the mayor approves the request for the demolition of houses near the drainage. Some 80 families will be affected from these two barangays.

Jimlani, however, said affected families will be relocated to Tibungco and Los Amigos.
