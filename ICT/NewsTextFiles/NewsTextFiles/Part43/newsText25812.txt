
Cracks have started appearing in the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) with its state secretary Sanjeev Srivastava having resigned from the post and his resignation letter being accepted by the party at a meeting on Sunday.

Though Srivastava is reported to have given his resignation on May 3, it was kept secret by the state party leaders in view of the Lok Sabha elections. On conditions of anonymity, another party official alleged that Srivistava had also started organising disgruntled party workers that amounted to anti-party activities.

When asked, AAP state convener Sukhdev Patel said that Srivastava was issued a notice in April last when reports about his indulging into anti-party activities came to his notice. “Instead of replying to the notice, Srivastava sent in his resignation,” said Patel.

“I resigned from the party as I felt that party leaders were not ready to go by its constitution,” said Srivastava.
