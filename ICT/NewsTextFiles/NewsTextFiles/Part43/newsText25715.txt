
BUTUAN CITY â€“ A python caused a nine-hour blackout in Surigao del Sur last Friday.

Ground engineers and technicians of the National Grid Corp. of the Philippines (NGCP) had a hard time searching for the cause of the blackout until they spotted the large constricting non-venomous snake that was already dead and believed to be electrocuted.

The python as big as the leg of an adult man was found at the conductor of the electric post in Davisol in Lianga, 90 kilometers south of the capital city of Surigao del Sur, Tandag.

The blackout started at 11:58 p.m. Thursday and power was restored at 9:25 a.m. Friday, the Surigao del Sur Electric Cooperative II (Sursureco II) said.

The power outage affected nine service areas of Sursureco II, including Tandag.

Sursureco Information Officer Aguinaldo Jaluag said such incident is no longer new to members of Sursureco II since one also happened several years ago.

However, several Sursureco II customers were angry because they were not informed of the blackout.

Two weeks ago, the province also suffered a 12-hour power outage due to maintenance of power stations and transmission lines.
