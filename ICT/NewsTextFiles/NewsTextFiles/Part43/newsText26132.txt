
MOSCOW, May 19. /ITAR-TASS/. Social networking and microblogging service Twitter has limited accessin Russia to the page of Ukraine's ultranationalist Right Sector group.

The page is still available to users with IP addresses registered outside the country.

Russian federal telecommunications supervisor Roskomnadzor had demanded repeatedly that Twitter's administration deletes information, including extremist materials, banned from distribution in Russia. The service has failed to satisfy these demands immediately.

Roskomnadzor has already blocked Right Sector's page on leading Russian social network site VKontakte.
