
A Ukip candidate caught on camera swearing at protesters has admitted she’s ‘not proud’ of her actions – but says she has no regrets.

Janice Atkinson, who describes herself as Nigel Farage’s ‘number two’, is vying to become an MEP at this week’s elections but was infuriated by anti-Ukip protesters while on the campaign trail.

Green Party member Maria Pizzey said she was part of a peaceful protest with a small group of activists in Ashford when Ms Atkinson told the group to ‘f*** off’. Ms Pizzey said she was also subjected to personal comments about her size.

She later defended her actions, saying she was upset by comments made about Ukip members.

Last week Ms Atkinson was criticised for saying parts of Kent were ‘no-go areas’ due to gangs of Eastern European immigrants.

Ms Atkinson is second choice on the party’s selected candidate list for the South East, behind leader Nigel Farage.

This means she will be elected MEP if Ukip wins two or more seats in Thursday’s election.
