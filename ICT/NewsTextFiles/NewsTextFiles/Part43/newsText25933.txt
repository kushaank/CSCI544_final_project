
Pastor Andrew Hamblin says he's ready for a new church location.

Some church members say they hope for a more convenient location.

Tabernacle Church of God in La Follette has 90 memebers.

LA FOLLETTE (WATE) - Campbell County's snake-handling preacher, Andrew Hamblin, plans to build a new church.

For three years, he's been pastor at the Tabernacle Church of God, which sits just outside of La Follette. Hamblin says he's trying to raise money for a new building somewhere else in Campbell County.

"Last Friday night we put it to a vote and the vote was unanimous to move," Hamblin said.

The current church building is where Hamblin starred in the reality show "Snake Salvation" and became well known for handling venomous snakes while preaching the Bible.

Hamblin says he'll miss the current church building, but it's time to move on to a bigger space. Tabernacle currently has 90 church members and many support the move for different reasons.

"I always liked the thought of a church family building, raising the money together, putting their own labor, building something with their own hands," said member Jeremey Henegar.

"It's kind of back far here and it's hard to find, but I think if we're closer more people know where it is. It will be a lot easier for people to find us," member Tabitha Bennett said.

Hamblin hopes to have the new church built by this winter. The congregation hopes to raise $50,000 for the building. So far, they've collected about $2,000.
