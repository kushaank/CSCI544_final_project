
Polish eurosceptics are on the move as Europe gears up for the parliamentary ballot between 22 and 25 May.

While the key battle for seats in the European Parliament in Poland continues between the pro-European center-right Civic Platform and the more eurosceptic Law and Justice party, a dark horse has emerged – the controversial Janusz Korwin-Mikke and his New Right party.

With six-percent support in a recent opinion poll, the anti-EU New Right would gain seats at the European Parliament and if they stand during next years general election then they would have representatives in the lower house of parliament in Warsaw.

“We need to wipe out 60 years of EU legacy. […] Otherwise, in 30 years Europe will become Islamic: that is, if China doesn’t buy us out first,” says monarchist and equal rights opponent Janusz Korwin-Mikke.

The rising popularity of eurosceptic attitudes in Poland reflects the growing criticism of the EU across the 28 nation bloc, with parties such as Britain's right wing UKIP party and others expected to take up to 30 percent of the vote during the elections this weekend.
