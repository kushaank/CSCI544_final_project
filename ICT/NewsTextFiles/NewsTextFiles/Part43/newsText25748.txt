
On 16 May Germany delivered the first 11 of 105 Leopard 2A5 MBTs that were purchased by Poland in November last year. The MBTs were delivered to the 34th Armoured Cavalry Brigade’s base in Zagan, Poland.

Under the November agreement signed Poland acquired 105 Leopard 2A5 tanks, 14 Leopard 2A4 tanks, 18 Bergepanzer 2 armoured recovery vehicles, 120 Mercedes DB1017A trucks, 40 U1300L Unimog trucks, 40 Mercedes MB250 light off-road vehicles (including some with communications equipment) and other special equipment, from German Army stocks for a total of €180 million.

Under the delivery schedule most of the MBTs (77 of theA5 version and 14 of theA4 version) will arrive in Poland by the end of 2014. The last 28 Leopard 2A5s are to reach Poland in 2015.

At the end of January 2014, it was announced that the 2nd Polish Brigade would be re-equip the 34th Armoured Cavalry Brigade with the MBTs. The brigade so far has been armed with two battalions of PT-91 light tanks.

Poland has also launched a competition to select a contractor to modernise 128 Leopard 2A4 tanks operated by the 10th Brigade. A single bid was received from  Polish Defence Holding (Polski Holding Obronny), teamed with KMW.

The upgrade includes new main gun stabilisation (from hydraulic to electric), add-on armour elements, fitting of a new auxiliary power unit and installation of modern observation and sighting equipment. In future, the Polish Armed Forces also plan to upgrade the Leopard 2A5 tanks.
