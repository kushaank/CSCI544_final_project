
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has sent a relevant message to Swiss President and Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Didier Burkhalter, OSCE Secretary-General Lamberto Zannier, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay and Council of Europe Secretary-General Thorbjorn Jagland.

“The sent messages in particular emphasize the inadmissibility of closed consideration by the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada of the circumstances of that crime,” the ministry said.

“Russia insistently calls on the leadership of leading international organizations to use all capabilities to influence the Kiev regime which in essence is sabotaging the investigation,” it said.

“Those guilty and initiators of what happened must be established and brought to account,” the ministry said.
