
US pressure could undermine Russia-Israel relations, Alexander Romanovich, vice  chairman of the Committee on International Affairs in Russia’s Duma, implied in  a briefing to Israeli reporters and academics Monday.

“Nothing can harm  the good relations between our two countries, as long as another power doesn’t  intervene. I won’t name it,” Romanovich said.

The lawmaker’s  comments came several weeks after Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman made it  clear that Israel plans to refrain from taking a position on the Ukrainian  crisis.

The policy comes from a concern that it would anger Moscow and  have a ripple effect on Israeli security concerns in the region, like Syria and  Iran.

Washington, however, does not back the position, with State  Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki saying last month that the US was surprised  when Israel skipped a vote on the matter in the UN General  Assembly.

“Nobody wants to  cross the border into Ukraine. Our troops are in Crimea, not Ukraine,” he  said.

Romanovich also said the border between Russia and Ukraine was  never finalized after the fall of the Soviet Union.

The vice chairman  also recounted debates in the committee about Ukraine and Crimea, saying that  the Duma Ethics Committee punished many of the legislators for using foul  language.

As for Iran and Syria, there are no plans to change Russia’s  policy, Romanovich said.

Still, Romanovich said,  the most recent easing of sanctions took place because of America, not Russia.
