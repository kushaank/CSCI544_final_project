This follows months of intense negotiations between the two governments and the nations’ major oil and gas companies, Gazprom and CNPC.

Gazprom said at the weekend it was "one digit" away from completing the 30-year gas supply deal.

The deal would mean Russia supplies China with a quarter of its domestic natural gas consumption, and will pull China away from dirtier coal-sourced power.

Although this deal has been talked about for many years, many see the sudden agreement as a move by Russia to reduce dependency on a European market rocked by the recent crisis in Ukraine.
