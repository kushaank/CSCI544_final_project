
Poland has launched a campaign in London, publicising the democratic and economic transformations the country achieved since the fall of communism following the 1989 June elections.

Billboards in 150 locations have been placed across the UK capital, including Heathrow Airport, Oxford Circus, Victoria and Leicester Square underground tube stations under the slightly obscure slogan “Polska. Spring Into”.

Advertising spots on BBC, CNN, Eurosport and Sky News will follow, centred around the key message of the campaign: “Look at Poland. See how much we have achieved and what we can offer to Europe”.

Similar publicity campaign are being launched in Germany, Belgium and Sweden as Poland celebrates this year three anniversaries – the fall of communism following the historic elections in June 1989, joining NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004.

“The campaign that also covers social media and public space will include interactive competitions about the anniversary of the first partially free elections in Poland,” a statement on Poland's foreign ministry web site says.
