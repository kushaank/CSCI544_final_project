
The sermon came after two days of heated debates on how to restructure the denomination and on ethical issues, including the church’s views on homosexuality.

The episcopal leader of the Dakotas Area, Bishop Kiesey used as her text the appearance of Jesus to his fishermen disciples, the last post-resurrection appearance of Jesus to followers in the Gospel of John, chapter 21. It is the story of how Jesus appears to the men in the boat, as a stranger on the shore, and asks if they are catching anything.

“No,” they respond. Well, then, the stranger indicates, try on the other side. The catch is great.

“Feed my lambs…tend my sheep…feed my sheep,” Jesus tells him.

The sermon was followed by a hymn, “Until All are Fed,” and by a “love feast,” a particularly Methodist observance that is not a sacrament but involves the sharing of bread. The service in Tampa used hot-cross buns, which the delegates broke and offered to one another.

“Jesus is calling one more time,” she said.
