
The container ships assigned to the new Andes Express Service will use the Panama Canal to get between port calls in North America and South America.

An alliance of shipping companies will launch a new weekly service Monday between several cities along South America's west coast and the U.S. East Coast, including Charleston.

Other ship calls in the rotation include ports in Chile, Peru, Colombia, Panama, Miami, Jacksonville and New York, according to a report on the website seatrade-global.com.

The Andes Express Service is being operated by APL, Mitsui OSK Lines and Hyundai Merchant Marine with six vessels that can accommodate the equivalent of 2,700 20-foot-long containers, including refrigerated cargo.
