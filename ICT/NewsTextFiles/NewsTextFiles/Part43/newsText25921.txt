
BRCKO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Floodwaters have triggered more than 3,000 landslides across the Balkans.

Three months' worth of rain fell on the region in three days, producing the worst floods since rainfall measurements began 120 years ago. At least two dozen people have died, with more casualties expected.

Tens of thousands of people have been forced from their homes and floodwaters are threatening to inundate Serbia's main power plant, which supplies electricity to a third of the country and most of the capital, Belgrade.

The waters receded in some locations Sunday, revealing the full scale of the damage. But emergency officials warn that the water will keep rising in other locations.

Bosnia's refugee minister describes the situation as "catastrophic."

The landslides have laid waste to entire towns and villages. They've also disturbed land mines leftover from the region's 1990s war and washed away warning signs that marked the locations of the unexploded weapons.
