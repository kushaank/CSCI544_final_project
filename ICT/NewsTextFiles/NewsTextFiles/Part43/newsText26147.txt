
A reassessment of Russia’s relations with the European Union and NATO is needed, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said, opening talks with his Slovak counterpart Miroslav Lajcak. "We want to discuss international affairs, the situation in Europe, what’s happening between us, between Russia and the EU and in the Russia-NATO Council in the context of the current crisis in Ukraine," the Russian minister said.

"A significant rethinking of [our] relations is necessary. We are trying to conduct such analysis with NATO and the EU as to what needs to be done to bring our relations in line with the existing documents," he said.

"It is important to understand where our views coincide and where they differ, he said. It is necessary to build these relations in accordance with the existing documents, for instance those pertaining to the NATO-Russia Council," the minister said.

"We appreciate Slovakia's well-balanced, pragmatic position," Lavrov said, Interfax reports.
