
BAGHDAD: Militants kidnapped an Iraqi candidate yesterday as attacks in Baghdad and northern Iraq killed nine people and officials prepared to announce the results of last monthâ€™s election. The latest unrest is part of a year-long surge in bloodshed that has fuelled fears Iraq is slipping back into the all-out sectarian conflict that left tens of thousands dead in 2006 and 2007.
