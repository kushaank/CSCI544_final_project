
Two Pakistani women found dead at a west Auckland home had suffered stab wounds, police say.

A double homicide investigation is now underway following the discovery of the bodies of the women, one aged in her mid-50s and the other in her late teens, at a residential address in Ranui earlier today.

Detective Inspector Greg Cramer says the women, who are believed to have been in a "family relationship", had suffered stab wounds.

Mr Cramer says police were called to the scene shortly after 10am by a man living at the house. The 55-year-old man is now assisting police with their inquiries, however, he is not in custody.

"We believe there is a relationship between the deceased women and the male occupier of the house also," says Mr Cramer.

Neighbours watched as the man left the scene with police earlier today.

"He was in a police car, but there was ambulance officers looking at him and also three police officers as well, and then they drove off," neighbour Rob Nixon, who lives next door to the address, told ONE News.

Mr Nixon says the family has lived in the home for more than three years and they were quiet and friendly.

"Husband and a wife and a daughter there most of the time and two sons that turn up visiting," says Mr Nixon.

Mr Nixon says he didn't hear anything unusual this morning and was only alerted to trouble when police and ambulance staff arrived.

The bodies remain at the house and are expected to be removed later tonight. A post-mortem examination will take place tomorrow morning.

A full scene examination is underway and is expected to take several days.

Police have not been called out to the house before today.
