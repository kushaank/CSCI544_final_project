MANILA, Philippines - It’s been a battle of lists, with at least 3 people coming out with different versions that don’t match. Alleged pork barrel scam mastermind Janet Lim Napoles says she gave her list to Justice Secretary Leila de Lima. Rehabilitation Secretary Panfilo Lacson says he got his copy from Jimmy Napoles , the husband of Janet. Former whistleblower on jueteng operations Sandra Cam says she, too, has her own list.

The Philippine Daily Inquirer publicized its own list which it supposedly culled from the hard disk drive of principal whistleblower Benhur Luy. It got hold of the drive’s contents from Luy’s parents who visited the paper’s offices in April 2013. His lawyer has said Luy did not have a list but only a record of pork barrel transactions involving different lawmakers and government officials.
