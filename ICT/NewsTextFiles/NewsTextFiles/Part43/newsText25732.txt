
ZAMBOANGA CITY - Military troops overran a temporary camp of the communist rebels following encounter Saturday that left an insurgent killed and undetermined others wounded in a far flung barangay of Misamis Occidental, according to security officials.

Maj. Gen. Felicito Virgilio Trinidad, chief of the army’s 1st Division, said the troops under Lt. Col. Gerry Besana of the 55th Infantry Battalion were on combat patrol when they chanced upon at about 9 a.m  about 30 heavily armed members of the New People’s Army (NPA) camping temporarily between the boundaries of the two villages that bordered Jimenez and Sinacaban towns.

The military official said fighting ensued for 45 minutes resulting in the death of one insurgent while undetermined others were wounded from the NPA rebels of the  group Section Committee Sendong.

Trinidad said the rebels retreated leaving their fallen comrade behind. One M16 rifle was also recovered on the camp site.

The troops also recovered a short rifle magazine, camouflage combat pack, 42 meters of wire for improvised explosive device (IED), 100-kilogram rice, personal belongings and rebel manuals described to be with intelligence value.

Trinidad said the encounter was a result of the continuous security operation against the spate of extortion activities of the NPA rebels in the area.

Trinidad also lauded the troops’ efforts  to give the rebelsa chance to yield to authorities first and join the mainstream of society instead of engaging the military in combat.
