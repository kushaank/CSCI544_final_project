
KARACHI,Sindh High Court (SHC) on Monday once again expressed displeasure over inaction of Anti-Violent Crime Cell (AVCC) and Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) police to recover a citizen, who has been missing since 2011.

A division bench headed by Justice Ahmed Ali M Sheikh issued notice to DIG AVCC and CIA to appear in court and explain efforts taken by his force to recover the citizen. The bench was seized with the hearing of a petition filed by Aslam Khan Ghori seeking whereabouts of his son Irfan Khan Ghori, taken captive by criminals during ethnic riots in Karachi in 2011.

At the outset of hearing, Nasir Aftab, SSP AVCC and CIA along with investigation officer Amjad Kalyar submitted a progress while assuring court that they will produce the captive soon in court.

Though, the bench came down hard on them while observing: SSP Nasir Aftab on both occasions submitted a stunning progress reports perusal of which showed that both are verbatim except one or two lines that too contain names of his special teams taking pains for completing formalities.

It noted that prima facie, the police officers even of SSP level are attempting to keep the court busy in passing orders and granting adjournments one after other.
