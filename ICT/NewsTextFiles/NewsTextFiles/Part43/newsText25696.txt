
Budget Secretary Florencio Abad  on Monday said that presidential assistant on food security Francis Pangilinan may eventually have expanded supervisory powers over projects that are under the office of Department of Agriculture Secretary Proceso Alcala.

But Abad denied reports that with the transfer of the four agencies under the DA as well as possible transfer of other related big-ticket items, Pangilinan will have control over 75 percent of the department’s P79 billion budget.

“Secretary Pangilinan and Secretary Alcala are still discussing how to divide among themselves some of the big-ticket items such as post-harvest facilities, high-value crops, and farm-to-market roads, among others,” Abad said in a phone interview.

“But even if you include all these to the four agencies, these still won’t add up to 75 percent. That’s nowhere near the truth,” Abad added.

President Benigno Aquino III earlier placed the National Food Authority, National Irrigation Authority, Philippine Coconut Authority, and Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority under the supervision of Pangilinan.

Pangilinan, for his part, said he and Alcala will thresh out which programs need their tighter coordination.

“We had a dinner meeting last Friday to thresh out tighter coordination efforts. In areas that require coordination, we will ensure that these will be addressed,” Pangilinan said in a text message.

He also denied that he will have control over 75 percent of the DA’s total budget.

“In 2014 only P28 billion or 1/3 of the DA budget of P79 billion went to NIA, NFA, PCA, and FPA, or roughly 35 percent,” Pangilinan said.
