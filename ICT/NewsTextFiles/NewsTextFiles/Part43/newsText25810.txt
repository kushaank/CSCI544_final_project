
The best line put forward by those offended by Councillor Doug Ford’s “Autismgate” comments suggests that the kids should simply be moved to brother Rob’s house.

It might, after all, be quieter for the neighbours.

“Frankly, I’d much rather have a dozen kids with autism living next door to me than one single member of the Ford family,” said one tweet.

When you have a politician complaining about a kids’ group home, it becomes an easy target.

And the not-so-skilled-in-finesse councillor for Etobicoke North (Ward 2) — who continually fights for his brother — walked into it all by himself.

But who cares!

The “Doug Ford hates autistic kids” designation doesn’t wash with anybody who knows the guy. He is as big-hearted as any of his critics and certainly just as (probably much more) charitable with his own money.

However, those looking to capitalize politically had no problem garnering attention.

So precious of them. Opportunistic.

They better be at the next meeting to face the “another age” Neanderthal residents to offer advice.

It’s amazing how quickly an opposition can form into a pack and bravely go for the throat. If only they had such indignation toward, say, the billions lost by other public figures or many other indiscretions including hand-picked people being investigated for more offensive things like erasing computer hard drives.

You don’t see as many tweets about political decisions to not offer life-saving drugs to a 12-year-old girl.

Either way, there could be more tough talk on expensive, unionized, social spending-icons and ideologies.

Big deal!

His asking if there were any sex offenders or people with criminal pasts was not out of line.

Ford did get that right.

Buying the house would be no more scandalous than spending $1 billion of taxpayers money to have the problem removed like we saw with gas plants.

It seems all loud-mouth Ford did was suggest the operation is not working for the neighbours, who matter too. He didn’t ever “attack” kids with autism, but was asking questions on behalf of his constituents about legitimate concerns. Lord knows Toronto has seen what can happen when mental health and policing meet.

Improve the operation or assess if it is the best place for such a program. It could very well be decided this place would be better suited to the streets where Chow, Tory or Rae live.
