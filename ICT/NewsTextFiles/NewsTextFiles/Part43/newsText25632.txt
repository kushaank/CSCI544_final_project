
KARACHI: Former president General (retd) Pervez Musharraf was exempted from appearing in court on Monday to attend the proceedings of the Akbar Bugti murder case, Express News reported.

Summoning Musharraf on June 16, the court ordered that the former military ruler’s guarantors should ensure his presence during future hearings.

Musharraf, who has been indicted by a special court for treason, has been on bail in three other major cases dating to his time in power, including one relating to the 2006 assassination of Bugti  during a military operation.

Bugti led an armed campaign to press for provincial autonomy and a greater share of profits from Balochistan’s natural resources.

His murder sparked deadly nationwide protests and inflamed an armed insurgency that rose up in 2004.

Musharraf, who led Pakistan from 1999 to 2008, returned from self-imposed exile in March last year to fight in general elections, but was barred from taking part and has faced a barrage of legal cases including treason.
