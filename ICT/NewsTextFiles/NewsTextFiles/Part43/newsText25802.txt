Young carers are people we simply cannot do without, who do an amazing job and deserve a break.

That is the message from Cumbria’s MPs as they give their backing to our Give Them A Break campaign, aiming to raise enough money to give these incredible young people some well-earned respite.

The politicians were full of praise for youngsters, some as young as four in Cumbria, who care diligently and selflessly for their parents, siblings and other family members.

Carlisle MP John Stevenson said it was a thoroughly worthwhile cause.

“These young carers do a huge amount of support work, much of which goes unseen but yet is absolutely vital for the families and individuals involved,” he said. “I have met with a number of the carers and have always been hugely impressed by their selflessness.

He added: “By providing support for those people they care for, they genuinely make our society a better place. We literally could not do without them and I hope that everybody will support this effort in any way they can.

Penrith and the Border MP Rory Stewart praised carers for their “amazing job”, particularly in the Penrith and Border area where there are a large number of people with a lack of mobility and an older population.

He said: “I have been so impressed with the dedication and would do anything I can to support them. Carers in general are an amazing group of people, without them society couldn’t survive.
