
Star Karissa is ready to ride in the Middle Tennessee Ride for Kids.

Ride for Kids motorcyclists in central Tennessee combined to raise $105,333 for the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation on May 18.

More than 180 motorcyclists attended the event in Franklin to honor our Stars, local children with brain tumors: Makenzie, Bishop, Karissa and Jessica.

Making life better for Ride for Kids Stars is the reason motorcyclists across the country ride for the PBTF, which funds medical research and family support programs to help eliminate the challenges of childhood brain tumors.

The event is still collecting donations online at www.rideforkids.org . Fundraisers will receive incentive credit through June 18.

In 2014, Ride for Kids is celebrating its 31st year of raising awareness and funds for the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation, a national voluntary health nonprofit. More than 28,000 children in the United States are living with the diagnosis of a brain tumor, and 13 more cases are identified each day. Motorcyclists have helped the PBTF become the world's largest non-governmental source of funding for childhood brain tumor research. Our programs also include free educational resources and special events for brain tumor survivors and their families. American Honda is the presenting sponsor of Ride for Kids. Other supporters include GEICO and Cycle World magazine. Register online at www.rideforkids.org or call 800-253-6530 to learn more.
