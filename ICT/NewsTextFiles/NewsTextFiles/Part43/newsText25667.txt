
Jamaica knows how to throw a party and tonightâs Clipper Round the World Yacht Race prize giving ceremony promises to be spectacular with hundreds of crew and special guests celebrating in style as the podium pennants for Race 11 - the PSP Logistics Panama 100 Cup and Race 12 - the Spirit of Jamaica Chase, are presented to the winning teams.

Henri Lloydâs latest win strengthens their lead in the overall race standings with a total of 120.9 points, just under nine points ahead of Great Britain with 112 points.

Clinging onto third place is OneDLL with 104 points which, together with Derry~Londonderry~Doire sitting in fourth with 97 points, had a disappointing run into Jamaica after recent good form, finishing in seventh and ninth places respectively.
