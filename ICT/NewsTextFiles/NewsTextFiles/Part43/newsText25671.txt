
Excavators say that the site was constructed by members of the Tallan culture.

Archaeologists working in the northern Peruvian region of Piura recently discovered an administrative complex that they believe was constructed by the Tallan culture.

El Comercio reports that investigations at the site began their excavation in two ditches near the town of Chaquira. Locals said that beads and small artifacts were sometimes found in and around the ditches.

Nuñera explained that the artifacts found within the structures by her team led them to the determination that they were dealing with an administrative complex. “The structures that we have found are similar to those that exist in Narihuala. Inside the objects that we found, there are ceramics polishers and ceramics fragments with different designs. It was an administrative center for the Tallan people, and was controlled by a chief,” said Nuñera.

The Tallan people lived in Piura between 1000 AD and 1200 AD. The exact age of the structure is unknown at this time.

According to El Comercio, archaeologists worked for a month before announcing their discovery.
