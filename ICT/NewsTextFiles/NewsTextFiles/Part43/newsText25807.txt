
India’s defeated Congress party closed ranks to defend South Asia’s most  famous political dynasty last night, rejecting a resignation offer in the  wake of the worst defeat in its history.

Sonia Gandhi, the party’s President, and her son Rahul, who led its disastrous  re-election campaign, both offered to step down during a meeting of top  party officials in Delhi held to discuss the result.
