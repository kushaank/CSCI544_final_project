
WASHINGTON—The United States called for restraint and the “immediate” release of hostages Sunday in Mali, where clashes between separatist militants and the army left dozens dead in the north.

Eight soldiers and 28 insurgents were killed in fighting Saturday outside the regional governor’s offices during Prime Minister Moussa Mara’s visit to the desert town, the government said, adding that around 30 civil servants were being held hostage.

“We condemn these acts, which undermine the fragile peace in northern Mali and efforts to bring peace, security, and development to all of its citizens,” State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.

“We will mobilize the resources to fight this war,” he added in a telephone interview.

Kidal, located 1,500 kilometers (900 miles) northeast of the capital Bamako, was the scene of anti-government protests by several hundred people on Friday and Saturday.
