
The election of Hindu nationalist Narendra Modi has sent shivers through many among India's 150-million strong Muslim community, but neighbouring Pakistan is cautiously hopeful for a thaw in long-fraught ties.

Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who is himself a centre-right leader, has hailed Modi's â€œimpressive victoryâ€� which saw the hardliner gain an outright majority in India's parliament for the first time in 30 years.

Sharif has cited his working relationship with Atal Bihari Vajpayee, India's last prime minister with the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as a reason for optimism, according to diplomatic sources.

It was during Sharif's second term in 1999 that Vajpayee rode a bus to Lahore to sign a peace accord, raising the prospect for normalisation between the two-nuclear armed neighbours that have fought three wars.

Three months later, the countries embarked on the Kargil conflict in the Himalayan region of Kashmir -- though Sharif has blamed his then-army chief General Pervez Musharraf who went on to overthrow him in a coup, for provoking the fighting without his knowledge.

With both leaders currently enjoying a strong mandate -- Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) won a big majority in elections last year -- members of parliament and experts say the stalled peace process could get fresh impetus.

Sherry Rehman, a member of parliament for the opposition Pakistan People's Party and former ambassador to the United States, told AFP: â€œThe blockbuster numbers should give Modi the parliamentary muscle and confidence to work with Pakistan for stability in the region.

Key issues confronting the relationship remain the disputed Kashmir region, as well as militancy inside India which New Delhi frequently accuses Pakistan of backing.

Bilateral ties have only slightly recovered from the rock bottom they hit after the 2008 Mumbai attacks in which 166 people were killed by Pakistani gunmen.

For its part, Pakistan accuses India of funding a long-running insurgency in its southwestern Balochistan province.

Simbal Khan, a former Pakistan fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said the unpopularity of the outgoing Congress party had hindered its ability to thaw ties, despite its more secular and liberal outlook.

â€œThere is a general feeling that coming from a right-of-centre platform and riding on this wave of popularity, any overtures or steps taken to mend relations or to take the subcontinent out of old constructs is more likely to happen under Modi's rule than Congress,â€� she said.

Khan cited as an encouraging example the warming of ties between Pakistan's Punjab province, which is governed by Sharif's brother Shahbaz, and the Sikh-centric Shiromani Akali Dal party, a BJP ally which rules India's Punjab state.

The analyst said she was hopeful that Sharif may soon grant â€œMost Favoured Nationâ€� status to India and open land borders in an effort to kickstart trade that would particularly benefit Pakistan's stuttering economy.

Sharif, a pro-business industrialist, is widely seen as being in favour of such a move though reports have suggested opposition by the all-powerful army has so far prevented him -- and could conceivably block future attempts.

Badar Alam, editor of Pakistan's Herald magazine, said Modi too would come under pressure from within his party if he were to push too hard for peace.

â€œRight-wing Hindu nationalists have always opposed normalising ties with Pakistan and a leader representing them will both be well placed to take the initiative vis a vis Pakistan and under pressure from his own supporters to not do so."

â€œWill Modi, as PM, be able to lead his electorate rather than be led by it?â€� he said.

While Pakistan's civilian leaders and business community are in favour of closer ties, many ordinary people revile Modi, who is tainted by communal riots in his home state of Gujarat 12 years ago that killed 1,000 people, mostly Muslims.

His campaign manifesto included pledges for a more muscular foreign policy, vowing a re-think of India's no-first strike nuclear policy and a hard line on Kashmir.

Such rhetoric had raised concern among some observers that another Mumbai-style attack planned on Pakistani soil could push the countries into all-out war.

But according to Mushahid Hussain, chairman of Pakistan's senate defence committee, some of the rhetoric could be simply an election strategy, and the two countries' nuclear capabilities would prevent such an outcome.

â€œThere are two sides to Modi -- a dark side based on bigotry and violence against Muslims, and a positive side on development. If he is willing to bid goodbye to the politics of hate, then are grounds for optimism,â€� he said.

Mr.Shariff is very naive  and needs to handle him carefully . Mr.Modi doesn't share any of the qualities of Mr.Vajpayee . Both are very different . Mr.Modi is a nationalist , while Mr.Vajpayee was a humanist .  He is a  strict administrator and ardent follower of Personalities like Hitler and Patel . Some say he would be under pressure for peace , those people forget that He has a free hand in party and rarely believe in team-work . He might start a peace process , but would retaliate severely if Kargil like blunder surfaces .

Dont worry guys. As long as there is no provocation from Pak, India, going by its natural policy itself, will never attack you.

So if you show peace, we will also reciprocate and both the countries can prosper with better economic ties and development.

@Karthik Big brother's like comment. YOU TOO dont worry, be happy and keep up with dreams.

Mr. Sharif has to be very careful in dealing with Mr. Modi. There is not at all any need to be panicked. development of India depends on her good behaviour with her neighbours by not interfering in their affairs. Moreover Pakistan should wait and see how the things develope there. Let us see how he fulfil his big promises on economics front.

I hope during peace process no Samjutah express blast or 26/11 like incident happens. Good thing is that both countries have right-leaning leaderships to give them some weight in the eyes of right-wing pressure groups.

better Ind-Pak stay indifferent. Though common people want friendship that looks impossible coz India has one power center (political leadership). while in Pak there are three (political,Army,religious mullah). Remember last time Bajpayee-Shariff were close to decisive breakthrough but eventually Kargil took place as other two's were not ready for ties.

@Ali.... How so? Can you explain? When you say "only India can bring that to the region" you mean India needs to bend over backwards with pants down so that Pak can do what ever they want.  No... this ain't your grandpa's time India. Problem is Eye for an Eye seems to be only makes them think twice.

May or may not speculations on Modi=Sharif thinking on amelioration of relations between India and Pakistan may lead us nowhere except disaster and destruction. Peace in the sub-continent will remain a distant dream unless the leaders of both the countries jump start their relation from the point of forming a joint defense of both India and Pakistan without thinking â€˜against whomâ€™.

Modi has received this much majority just because Indians liked his development strategy in Gujarat. If he leaves his path of development and encourages any communal issues then for sure with the same majority they will send him home. Since democratic institutions are much stronger than Modi and also after 2002 riots (by then he was only months chief minister of Gujarat) there is no single such issue there.

A small body of determined spirits fired by an unquenchable faith in their mission can alter the course of history. Those were the words of Mahatma Gandhi. Unfortunately I donâ€™t think either India or Pakistan are interested in peace. Let us be pragmatic. 65 years of our nasty past tells us all. There are latent forces in India and in Pakistan which prevents that to happen for their political and personal gain. History will not be kind to Indo Pak  for any one  intend to write it. The very ink with which history is written is merely fluid prejudice and blood. Hate, hate, and hate that all we have spread over the subcontinent. So much of hate that we are willing to wipe out each other with our nuclear stock pile. Folks.. History is a relentless master. It has no present, only the past rushing into the future. To try to hold fast is to be swept aside. If we can end our differences, at least we can help make the sub- continent safe for diversity. Let us work hard towards peace and perspire with the inspiration that  a pint of sweat, saves a million gallon of blood.

Wise decision by the Indian Muslims to offer Laddo to the winning BJP, may be this gesture will be helpful to some extent.

Modi has sent shivers through many among India's 150-million strong Muslim community And here the picture shows muslim women celebrating Modi's victory!

This should be akin to Pakistan admitting its defeat in its 'cold war' against India. Its time we bury the hatchet and make peace.

@Karthik India should also adopt the same policy, and try to remain peaceful, but in case it tries to antagonize Pakistan, then certainly Pakistan will retaliate also, just the way it did before. However, we expect healthy diplomatic relations with all the nations, including India. And India by no means should underestimate the powers of Pakistan. We expect friendly relations with our neighboring country, and we wish you good luck and prosperity.

There is no need to be too optimistic, just wait and see when Mr Modi will come out with his true colors.

Exactly in which world do people like Sherry Rehman live in? Ignorance Land? Modi and his old RSS buddies won this election on an anti-Pakistan platform. Modi is in the process of appointed "The Butcher of Kashmir" as the Army head who is on the record of saying he will create many Bangladesh out of Pakistan.

@khanm Very well said. Why is there so much animosity? I earnestly seek peace between the 2 countries.

Modi is not a normal human being. He has no family, friends, business or even a bank account. In a crisis between the two countries, he is unlikely to be driven by any human emotion but purely by his extreme ideology and might take a very rash action. We should handle him very cautiously but firmly like one handles a suicide bomber.

There should certainly be peace as that is whet most of the citizens from both the countries want. But in order to gain respect, you have to give respect, instead of blaming Pakistan every everything wildly, without any proof.

@Karthik Wishful thinking is one thing and ground reality is another, The more closely you look at the enormous power that Modi is expected to wield in the wake of the majority vote he has mustered in the elections, the more skeptical one would feel vis-a-vis his outlook towards Pakistan, especially if a brow-beating stance is adopted by him. So, nobody should unnecessarily be overly optimistic about the Indo-Pak relations yet as a lot of ground has still to be covered in resolution of sensitive issues with complete fairness and honesty from both sides.

Pakistan is irrelevant to India.  Mr. Modi has far larger aspirations - to take the world's 4th largest economy to great heights.  Pakistan is always India-obsessed, militarily controlled, and days and dollars away from national failure and collapse.  Mr. Modi is a deep and ardent admirer of China - and what Pakistanis don't realize now is that under Modi, the Pakistan-China ties will get far weaker, while significantly strengthening with India.   Similarly, the US will start to move more towards Modi as he asserts his muscular foreign policy.  India will show a much more assertive, muscular and aggressive foreign policy stance.  Indian muslims will have no need to fear - their lot will dramatically improve economically under Modi.  I voted for Modi - because I love India, and believe that under Modi, India will scale amazing new heights.  Modi will be around for 10-15 years ... so Pakistan better get used to it and learn not to mess with india.  Otherwise, things will be fine.

What a nonsensical overstatement "150 million" Muslims get shivers down their spine on Modi's rise to power. Muslims in India are not afraid of any Mody or any person. They need to get that "Shivers down their spine" when the majority Hindus turn out to be fascists or Muslim haters.  In fact it is their rationale and open hearts which had guaranteed the well being of Muslims so far.

@NORI BJP got only 31% of the polled votes. So it is not a representative govt.

@US Citizen agree with your but would like to add, that peace for peace.

@Mirza then who is and by the way how many votes the elected govt of Pakistan got.

@Mirza: This is how elections are won in a democratic country. They got 31% and other are far behind them.

By endorsing Mohdi, Indian majority has endorsed muslim massacre of Gujrat. Shame on muslims who supported him out of fear. If not fear what could it be? he hasn't done any "great" to win their support except to slaughter them like animals.

@ali hammad You guys are so backward that every sentence in your limited vocabulary had a 'Muslim ' in it, yet you happen to be their biggest killers, so yes reason and thinking is something alien to you.

@Mirza Rest 69% got distributed between hundred's of regional/national parties of shapes and sizes. I have no idea how many parties mushroom during election time.

@ali hammad  People of India endorsed Supreme court finding that the riots in Gujarat triggered by Muslim mobs setting a train on fire at GODHRA killing hundreds of Hindus in their own land,had nothing to do with MODI or found any evidence against him!

@Roy i absolutely i agree with you... Pal... if i have the media of education in my hand of indo Pak. After one decay if you ask any child 2+2 he will say 5. my dear hate cannot be ended by hate but by love. let us educate our new generation to love one and other as human being first and then love each other as Hindu, Muslim or christian.

PM Nawaz is pursuing excellent foreign policy of promoting peace and trade with neighbors. However, in case of India he will not be able to accomplish much in the absence of a positive reciprocation from India and support of Pakistani security forces. Any way let us wait and see.
