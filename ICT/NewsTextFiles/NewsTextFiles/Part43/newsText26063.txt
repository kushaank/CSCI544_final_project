Forbes estimates Dmitry Rybolovlev's worth at $8.8 billion.

GENEVA — A Swiss court has ordered a Russian billionaire to pay more than 4 billion Swiss francs to his ex-wife to settle their divorce after a six-year legal fight.

The Geneva divorce court's judgment says Dmitry Rybolovlev of Monaco must pay 4,020,555,987.80 Swiss francs ($4,509,375,184.80) to ex-wife Elena Rybolovleva of Geneva.

In a statement Monday her lawyer Marc Bonnant called it "the most expensive divorce in history" — an unheard-of amount for Switzerland and for Russian oligarchs — but noted the judgment could be appealed.

Rybolovlev's wife had demanded $6 billion from the man known as the "fertilizer king," whose fortune from potash mining made him the world's 79th richest person. Forbes estimates his worth at $8.8 billion.

His Geneva lawyer did not comment.
