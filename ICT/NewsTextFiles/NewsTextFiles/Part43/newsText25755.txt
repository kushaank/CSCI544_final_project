
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- The student slain in a Purdue University classroom has been awarded a posthumous degree.

WLFI-TV and the Journal & Courier report Andrew Boldt of West Bend, Wisconsin, was awarded a posthumous bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering during commencement ceremonies Sunday on Purdue's main campus in West Lafayette.

The 21-year-old Boldt was fatally shot and stabbed Jan. 21 inside a classroom on the campus. Twenty-three-year-old Cody Cousins of Warsaw, Indiana, who also was a Purdue electrical engineering student at the time, has been charged with murder in connection with the slaying. His attorney said last week he intends to present an insanity defense on behalf of Cousins.
