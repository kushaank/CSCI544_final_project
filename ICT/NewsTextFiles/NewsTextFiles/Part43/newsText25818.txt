
Fayose said it was wicked for the State Government that refused to pay its hotel bills for over six months to have suddenly realised hat it needed to pay over N100 million to book hotels just because of election.

The PDP candidate  said all attempts to circumvent the will of Ekiti people by the APC government will fail,

“Let all outstandings being owed our hotel owners by the APC evil government be paid first.

“And if Governor Kayode Fayemi and those that are using the June 21 election to siphon Ekiti funds like, let them go beyond the booking of all hotel rooms in Ekiti. Let them also book all roads in the State so that no one can be able to use the roads between now and June 21.

“They can also go a step further in the demonstration of their wickedness and desperation by booking the air that we breathe so that no one will be able to breathe because of the June 21 election.
