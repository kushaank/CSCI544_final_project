
SAINT PREX, Switzerland--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Ferring Pharmaceuticals marks World IBD Day (May 19th) with        the launch of Guts4life ( www.guts4life.com ),        a new interactive website with information, support and inspiration for        people concerned with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, conditions        known as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). IBD describes a range of        chronic diseases of the gastrointestinal system characterised by        intermittent flares with debilitating symptoms that can affect a        patient’s quality of life and lead to emotional distress and social        isolation. Guts4life was designed together with IBD patients to provide        support and encouragement throughout the IBD journey—from bowel symptom        worries, to diagnosis, through managing and living with IBD.

"Being diagnosed with IBD can be a life changing event for the patient        but also friends and family," said Dr. Johan Masure, Global Medical        Director, Gastroenterology/Endocrinology at Ferring. “With Guts4Life        aimed at IBD sufferers and those close to them, Ferring aims to provide        information that will increase understanding of the condition and how        best to handle it."
