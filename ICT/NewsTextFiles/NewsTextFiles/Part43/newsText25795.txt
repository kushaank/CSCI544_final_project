
The battle to become Ontario's next premier is headed north.

The Northwestern Ontario Municipal Association [NOMA] says the Northern Leaders Debate is scheduled in Thunder Bay on May 26.

Progressive Conservative Leader Tim Hudak has not yet confirmed.

In an email to CBC News, a spokesperson for Hudak's campaign said, "We’ve had a few different invitations for a Northern Leaders Debate and are looking at the options that best fit with our schedule."

NOMA executive director Kristen Oliver confirmed in an email that Schreiner had not been included, saying "a decision was made to invite leaders currently elected in Queen's Park."

Last week, Wynne and Horwath got into a public back-and-forth on northern issues on Twitter.

@Kathleen_Wynne Love the North. In fact, I was just there this week. Our govt will strengthen MNR & MNDM and invest in rural infrastructure.
