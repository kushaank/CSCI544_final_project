He said that this initiative would be useful to the youth by helping to spread the message of peace.

Mr Elvis Agukwe, Coordinator South East, MP, said that the involvement of the group in peace move became necessary following the growing insecurity in the country.

Agukwe said that religion should not be imposed on anybody, and called on the youthds to be part of the effort to stop   insurgency, and that government could not do it alone.
