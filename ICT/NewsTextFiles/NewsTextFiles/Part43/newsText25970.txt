
The Seattle Times is reporting the seven-year-old boy who slipped into the falls at Whatcom Falls Park has died.

Jaden Griffin died on Thursday, just two days after he slipped and fell about 30 feet into the falls. It took two hours before rescuers could reach him.

Griffin was initially sent to PeaceHealth Saint Josephs Medical Center before being moved to Seattle Children’s Hospital.

The boy had been visiting the falls with his parents and a 5-year-old sibling.

Miles Mikolas allowed three hits in eight scoreless innings and the Texas Rangers opened a three-game set against the Seattle Mariners with a 2-0 win on Monday night.
