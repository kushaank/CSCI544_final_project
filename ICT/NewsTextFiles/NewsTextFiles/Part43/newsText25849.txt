
JERUSALEM: Israel’s chief negotiator Tzipi Livni (pictured), came under attack yesterday for talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, with senior officials insisting there was no intention to resume peace negotiations.

Thursday’s meeting in London was the first between the two sides since the collapse last month of the latest round of talks, and came after both held separate talks with US Secretary of State John Kerry.

But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office and ministers quickly moved to distance themselves from the Livni-Abbas meeting, insisting it was private and did not signal any official intention to resume talks with the Palestinians. Israel pulled out of the talks in mid-April, saying it would not negotiate with any Palestinian government supported by Hamas after the leadership in the West Bank signed a unity deal with the rival Islamist rulers of Gaza, who are committed to the destruction of the Jewish state.

Although Netanyahu was reportedly angered by the meeting, he knew about it in advance and communicated his concerns to Livni, an official in his office said, the implication being that he had not moved to block the talks.

Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz, a hardliner close to Netanyahu, was quick to criticise Livni.

Speaking on Channel 2’s Meet the Press on Saturday, Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman also insisted the meeting had been private.

“It’s true that Livni met Abu Mazen, but these were certainly not negotiations,” he said, calling it a “private” initiative, and noting that Livni herself had voted in favour of the security cabinet decision to freeze talks with any government backed by Hamas.
