
A QUEZON City court rescheduled on Monday the pre-trial of communist leaders Benito and Wilma Tiamzon for kidnapping and serious illegal detention, pending review of the motion filed by the accused.

Judge Madonna Echiverri of the Quezon City Regional Trial Court (QCRTC) branch 81 reset the hearing to July 21, 2014.

In the motion, Tiamzon's camp said the court should withdraw the kidnapping case against the couple, as it was already included in the rebellion cases, which the Supreme Court resolved in June 2007.

Edre Olalia of the National Union of People's Lawyers, one of the defense counsels, said the prosecutors maintained that they have the right to file the said cases against the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army leaders.

On June 1, 1988, the Tiamzons allegedly abducted Lieutenants Clariton Santos, Oscar Singson, Rommel Salamanca, and Abraham Casis of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and Sergeant John Jacob of the Philippine Narcotics Command in Candelaria and Tiaong, in the Quezon province.
