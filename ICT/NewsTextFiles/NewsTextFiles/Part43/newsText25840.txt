
Campden BRI has been chosen by the Qatar Supreme Council of Health to oversee an ambitious programme to improve the country’s food safety.

The UK-based food industry support body will design and manage a comprehensive programme to train more than 250 of Qatar’s food inspectors via a series of intensive workshops.

The Risk-Based Food Safety Inspections Skills workshops, which will include both theoretical and practical elements, will run over 18 weeks throughout this year, and will be delivered in Arabic by Taylor Shannon International on behalf of Campden BRI.

Dr Anton Alldrick, special projects manager at Campden BRI, said the courses would emphasise the need to take a risk-based approach to food safety, from farm to table.

She added: “The inspectors will be reminded of the significant food safety hazards that can be associated with food, how these are prevented and what evidence the inspector should look for to ensure that food businesses are correctly managed.

The head of Qatar's National Committee for Food Safety, Dr Sheikh Mohamed al-Thani, said: “The training will help our inspectors understand the risks associated with various food items in the long term.

Campden BRI provides technical, legislative and scientific support and research to the food and drinks industry worldwide, with a comprehensive 'farm to fork' range of services covering agri-food production, analysis and testing, processing and manufacturing, safety and training.
