
As Ukraine is preparing for its historic elections due on May 25, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that units that were amassed along the border with Ukraine have been ordered to return to bases.

Putin noted that some 40,000 Russian troops had been withdrawn, but NATO and the United States insisted they saw no signs of that.

Ukraine is due to go to the polls Sunday in historic presidential and mayoral elections that could affect the country’s very makeup and its ties between the West and Russia.

The current leader of opinion polls is billionaire, politician and businessman Petro Poroshenko, though he appears to be still falling short of the absolute majority required to avoid a second stage on June 15.

Meanwhile, tensions remained high in the troubled Donetsk and Luhansk regions near the country’s border with Russia. Pro-Russian militants there have said they would boycott the elections.
