
On 14 and 16 May, Cairo Opera House audiences were treated to the unique Paraguay Omimbipa performance of folkloric riches by the Paraguayan Mimbipa Ballet troupe -- the brain child of choreographer Sussy Sacco, also founder of the Academia de Danza Sussy Sacco.

Colourful dresses, lovely polkas and pulsating galopas, Paraguayan traditional harp, a peacock fight and bottle dance â€“ all added to the musical and visual profusion emanating from the heart of South America. The arrival of the troupe to Egypt paralleled an important date in their national history: on 15 May 1811, the Paraguayan people rose to independence by overthrowing the Spanish administration.
