
Moscow has made similar  statements before, leading NATO, Brussels and Washington to dispute that  any withdrawals had taken place.

"In connection with the  completion of the planned spring phase of training troops ... on the  ground in Rostov, Belgorod and Bryansk regions ... the Russian President  gave the command to the Minister of Defense to return the troops who  took part in the exercises," the president's office said, in a statement  posted on its website.

However, NATO's top official Anders Fogh  Rasmussen said: "We haven't seen any evidence of Russian withdrawal of  troops and I regret that."

Russia has about 40,000 troops deployed near the border with Ukraine.

On  Friday, pro-Russian insurgents retreated from government buildings in  the major eastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol as steelworkers began  citizen patrols.

Ukraine is set to go the polls on May 25 to elect a new president. Recent polling cited by the Kiev Post newspaper  indicates that businessman Petro Poroshenko, known locally as the "chocolate king" for his interests in the candy business, is the clear  front runner.

Moscow has repeatedly said that the results of that election will be illegitimate.
