
As 2NE1 celebrated five years as one of K-pop's top idol group, they also took the Philippines by storm with their "All or Nothing" concert.

The concert took place at the Mall of Asia Arena in Manila, where 2NE1 celebrated their anniversary on stage with Filipino Blackjacks. Here, Sandara Park was especially popular due to her roots in the Philippines and being able to speak Tagalong fluently.

"Cakes in various colors sent from fans were displayed on stage so that 2NE1 could celebrate the special occasion not only among themselves, but also with fans. 2NE1 playfully put the cake’s icing on each other's’ faces, which drew a joyful cheer from the audience," said a YG-Life blog post after the concert.

"DARA posted a message on her SNS in Tagalog after the concert ended, saying, 'I’m the happiest person right now. Black jack! 2NE1 loves you!'"

This 2NE1 concert was also filled with celebrity spottings, including four Filipino gentlemen for the salacious lap dance segment.

This included actors Sam Milby, Joross Gamboa, Jason Abalos, and Ram of the G-Force Stallions dance group.

Check out a clip of the lap dance below to 2NE1's single "I Love You." You can hear the eruption of screams after the names of each Filipino celebrity were announced.

"Dony's face is like, 'I hate this part,'" wrote Stevie James on YouTube. This is in response to the popular rumor that CL and YG back-up dancer Dony is an item.

Happy anniversary to 2NE1!
