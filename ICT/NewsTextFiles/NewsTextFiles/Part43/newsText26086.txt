
MOSCOW: Russian natural gas exports to European consumer nations via Ukraine remained stable on Monday, a spokesman for the state-controlled gas producer Gazprom said.

Russia has warned that it will not supply Ukraine with gas in June unless Kiev pays in advance, raising fears that deliveries to Europe could be affected.

Gazprom meets 30 percent of Europe's gas needs, while it ships around a half of its gas to Europe trough Ukraine.
