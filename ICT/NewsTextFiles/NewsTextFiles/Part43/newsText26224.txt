MOSCOW, May 19 (Reuters) - While an agreement on price is still elusive, Moscow and Beijing have come up against another hurdle in their more than 10 year talks to secure a gas deal - they cannot agree on whether China should pay up front.

Sources close to Russia's Gazprom and in the gas industry said the state-controlled company wanted China to pay $25 billion now to secure future gas supplies, which should start in 2018 at a yearly rate of 38 billion cubic metres.

China has so far been reticent, concerned that other gas suppliers, namely former Soviet Turkmenistan, would also want pre-payment and the standoff may scupper a deal Moscow hopes to hold up to the West as proof that it does not need its custom.

"We are pinning our hopes on Putin's May visit," a source at Gazprom said.
