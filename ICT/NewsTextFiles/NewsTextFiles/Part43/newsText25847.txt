
Qatar Investment Authority is reportedly acquiring joint control of a group of luxury hotels in five European cities.

According to a Bloomberg report, the Qatari sovereign wealth fund’s Katara Hospitality unit is taking on the Carlton InterContinental in Cannes, Amsterdam’s Amstel InterContinental plus hotels in Frankfurt, Madrid and Rome, citing a notice on the website of the European Commission’s competition authority.

The hotels are managed by and will continue to be jointly controlled by the UK’s InterContinental Hotels Group Plc, it said.

Katara's international portfolio includes the Raffles Hotel Singapore, Le Royal Monceau - Raffles Paris, Schweizerhof HotelBern and Renaissance Sharm El Sheikh Golden View Beach Resort in Egypt.

International properties under development include Bürgenstock Resort Lake Lucerne (opening 2015), Royal Savoy Lausanne (opening 2014), Comoros Beach Resort (opening 2015), Tazi Palace Hotel Tangier (opening 2015), and a hospitality complex in Gambia (opening 2016).

Last week, Katara Hospitality announced that it had signed a management agreement with Starwood Hotels and Resorts to run the luxury Excelsior Hotel Gallia in Milan.

Owned by Katara, Excelsior Hotel Gallia will open in November following an extensive renovation and will become part of Starwood's Luxury Collection.
