
A majority of respondents went with "wouldn't matter" for most of Pew's selected attributes (experience in D.C and government, plus religiosity being the exceptions), so 2016 is still anybody's race. But there are qualities that saw a sizable difference between favorability and unfavorability, where respondents (to whom the attributes mattered) had a clear preference. It's these categories that should draw the attention of any potential candidates for 2016.

A candidate's gender wouldn't matter too much, it seems, with 19 percent saying they'd be more likely to support a woman and 9 percent saying less (though liberals, at 40 percent, are much more likely to support a woman than conservatives at 10 percent), but age would – 36 percent said they'd be less likely to support a candidate 70 years of age or older.
