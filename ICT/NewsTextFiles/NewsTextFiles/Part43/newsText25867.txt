
Doha Centre For Media Freedom   (DCMF) has reiterated its condemnation of the trial of three Al Jazeera   journalists in Egypt, and demanded that urgent medical care be provided   to a fourth journalist on hunger strike.

“Abdullah al-Shami has been on hunger strike   since January and he requires immediate medical treatment to save his   life, according to medical experts,” DCMF said in a statement yesterday.

May 22.

The journalists have been detained since   December 29 and DCMF has reiterated its solidarity with them, calling   for their immediate release.

The centre has joined other international human   rights and media organisations to show support for the journalists and   is calling on all others to persevere with their campaigns for the   release of all four journalists, including al-Shami, who has been   detained since August 2013 without charge.

DCMF has urged all organisations to support the   campaign to ensure that al-Shami does not lose his life as a result of   his hunger strike, which began on January 21.
