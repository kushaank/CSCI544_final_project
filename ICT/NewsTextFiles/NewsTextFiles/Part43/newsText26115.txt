
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen proposes a Russia- NATO Council meeting to be scheduled after next week's early presidential election in Ukraine. During his monthly press-conference, Rasmussen said that NATO has not yet received Moscow’s response to his proposal.

"On the one hand, we’ve blocked all practical cooperation, on the other, we have a cooperation channel, which is the Russia-NATO Council through which we can exchange diplomatic messages. After the crisis began we had a meeting on 5 March when we put forward the initiative of the following meeting next week but we have not received Russia’s response yet," Rasmussen said at the press-conference.

As a NATO source told RIA Novosti, the Council meeting to discuss the situation in Ukraine could be held on 27 May.

Rasmussen also told journalists that he cannot see the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Ukrainian border so far. He stressed that he would be the first to appreciate such a step.

The Russian president’s press-service reports that, due to the termination of the scheduled springtime military training that took place on firing grounds in the Rostov, Belgorod and Briansk Regions, Vladimir Putin ordered the Minister of Defence to return the troops participating in the exercise to their bases and continue combat practice on local training grounds.
