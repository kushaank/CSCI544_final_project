
CEBU, Philippines - A 23-year-old man who pretended to be a part of the market task force was apprehended by the Talisay City government's real market task force in Barangay Tabunok, Talisay City.

Glen Latonio, single, resident of Barangay Lagtang was put behind bars Sunday for alleged extortion and usurpation of authority.

Market task force head Avelino Lawan said they have been receiving several complaints from vendors concerning individuals who represent themselves as part of the market task force before allegedly extorting them.

According to initial investigation, the suspect promised vendors they could display their items along the road without fear of facing violations. This is not, however, allowed in Talisay City.

Lawan said a certain Perla Reponte, one of the vendors, complained that she gave more or less P1,000 to the suspect for her to be invulnerable but still she was apprehended by the "real" task force.
