
This is the first time that the Philippines will host the regional forum for East Asia. WEF cited the Philippines as “writing one of the greatest economic comeback stories in recent years” . The Philippines is poised to be the strongest performing Southeast Asian economy in 2014, with GDP growth projected to surpass 6.5%.

“The Philippines continues to provide great opportunities for investments. We have been committed investors in the country for over five decades. The WEF will further highlight the opportunities that the emerging Philippines offers. We look forward to the discussions which will uncover more opportunities in the region,” SM Vice Chairperson Teresita Sy-Coson said.

The WEF event will serve as an ideal platform for participants to deliberate the opportunities of the ASEAN Economic Community to promote greater inclusion across East Asia and to instil more resilient decision-making in the face of unpredictable economic and natural disruptions.

In parallel with the WEF regional meeting, SM and BDO Unibank, Inc. are also joint gold sponsors in the 10th ASEAN Finance Ministers’ Investors Seminar (AFMIS), a key gathering hosted by the Philippine government on May 20, 2014. This year, the AFMIS aims to tackle ASEAN’s growth prospects, the ongoing initiatives of the ASEAN Finance Process to the ASEAN Economic Community, and the milestones and investment opportunities for individual economies and various country sectors. The AFMIS is held yearly since 2004 to promote ASEAN as an investment destination.
