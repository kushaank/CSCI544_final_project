
Pakistan has started ‘back-channel diplomacy’ with Bhartia Janta Party (BJP) in a bid to make a ‘new beginning’ with India.

While speaking to Wall Street Journal in Mumbai on Sunday, Pakistan’s High Commissioner in India Abdul Basit said that regardless that who comes in power as a result of election, Islamabad is keen to enhance ties with the neighbor.

“We are very interested in the stability and peace of this region,” he said.

According to sources, Pakistan’s envoy in India has been silently in contact with the victorious party to convey Islamabad’s aspiration for ‘meaningful engagement’ with New Delhi.

Insiders said that a Pakistani envoy in India has informed BJP leadership that Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz’s (PML-N) is pursuing a policy of ‘economic development and peaceful neighborhood’ and wants to work with the new government to resolve all outstanding issues.

“Our Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s vision is very clear. We are very interested in the stability and peace of this region. Our priority is the socioeconomic development of Pakistan. The relationship with India is particularly important because of the long history of war,” Basit said.

“We have no view of that. It would be like jumping the gun. We will willingly and readily engage with the new government, whoever heads it.” he added.

Replying to a question, the Pakistani High Commissioner said that trade is the top priority area where both of the countries could work together. Both could reduce the list of tariffs imposed items. And both sides could reduce non-tariff barriers to trade, including visa regimes, banking facilities and communication issues.

A source told initial contacts with the BJP, Foreign Office is buoyant of a positive development after. It was thanks to backdoor diplomacy that Nawaz Sharif promptly congratulated Modi over his election victory.
