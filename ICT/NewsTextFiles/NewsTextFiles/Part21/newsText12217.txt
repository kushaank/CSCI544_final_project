JERUSALEM--Israel's central bank on Monday called for the government to reduce its 2015 budget, saying the current draft includes a deficit-to-gross domestic product ratio higher than most other advanced economies and will not allow the country to reduce its debt-to-GDP ratio.

With that said, the bank also praised the government for reducing spending and the deficit in 2013 and 2014.

The bank said the government must both reduce spending and increase tax revenues in 2015, as there is currently a gap of about 12 billion shekels ($3.47 billion) between planned spending and the expenditure ceiling that will allow for further deficit reduction. The bank warned that if cuts aren't made, Israel's deficit and debt will increase not only next year but in the next several years.

Israel's central bank, including its former governor Stanley Fischer, who is now deputy vice chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, has been highly critical in recent years of government spending and has exerted pressure on the finance ministry to reign in the deficit.

Due to spending reductions, Israel finished 2013 with a deficit equal to about 3% of its GDP, lower than the 4.2% ratio it recorded in 2012, and in line with government targets. The deficit is expected to again total around 3% of GDP in 2014. The shrinking deficit "restored the credibility of the government's commitment to reducing debt," the bank said in a statement Monday. This has resulted in a decline in yield spreads between Israel and other advanced economies, thus reducing Israel's interest payment burden, the bank said.

Israel's budget, and especially its defense spending, is currently a major political issue, and recently resulted in the army canceling exercises in anticipation of spending cuts.
