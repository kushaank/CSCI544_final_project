Genkyotex is developing first in class, small molecule therapeutics that        specifically and selectively inhibit the NOX family of enzymes. Using a        unique screening platform, Genkyotex has identified novel NOX inhibitors        with the potential to treat disease areas with a high clinical need and        large market potential. The company’s lead product, GKT137831, is now in        a Phase 2 clinical study in patients with diabetic nephropathy and has        shown promise in several other disease models, including        atherosclerosis, lung and liver fibrosis, osteoporosis, and in models of        angiogenesis. Genkyotex was founded in 2006 by scientists from        Switzerland, the USA and Japan, with backing from Geneva incubator        Eclosion. Since 2011, expansion of the investor base, led by Edmond de        Rothschild Investment Partners, with Vesalius BioCapital and MP        Healthcare Venture Management, has provided significant investment to        Genkyotex.
