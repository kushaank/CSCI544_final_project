
The Caddo Valley City Council is looking to amend a 2005 ordinance to create a penalty for businesses who do not pay alcohol permit fees on time.

CADDO VALLEY, Ark.

Aldermen on Tuesday will consider amending a 2005 ordinance setting permit fees and taxes on businesses that sell alcoholic beverages.

The Caddo Valley City Council will meet at the Fire Station for a light agenda, which includes the proposal to penalize businesses that sell alcoholic beverages when they fail to pay the permit on a set date.

The original ordinance does not allow the city to the option to assess a penalty; the new one would penalize the permit applicant or permit holder a daily penalty of $100 until the permit and accrued penalties are paid in full, according to language in the proposed ordinance.

If the ordinance is passed, private clubs would have to pay the permit fee by July 1, and other alcohol-selling businesses would have to pay by June 30.

City officials are requesting the ordinance be passed with an emergency clause, which would set the new law into effect immediately upon its passage.

In other business, City Attorney Madeline Bennington will update the council on proposed business permits, pending lawsuits against the city and river recovery fees.

The city council decided in a recent meeting to change the regular meeting place this month, as City Hall is a polling place for citizens in Caddo Valley and northeast Clark County.

The meeting begins at 6 p.m. and is open to the public.
