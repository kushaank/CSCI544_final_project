
BOCA RATON, Fla., May 19, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Magna Carta World Heritage LLC announced today a marketing partnership with the American Seniors Association, a new voice of America's seniors, with more than 5 million members. The marketing partnership will offer the 800th Anniversary Edition of this historical document to its members, while also donating copies to the younger generation through schools and colleges throughout America.

James Ryan, President & CEO of ASA added, "We are excited to bring this offering to our members as it is a symbol of many of the rights and issues facing seniors today. Moreover, the opportunity to educate America's young people of the significance of the Magna Carta is an added benefit."

Sealed in 1215 at Runnymede, England, Magna Carta will celebrate its 800th Anniversary on June 15, 2015. Magna Carta became the most important charter of human rights in history, the basis of the US Constitution, and – as the foundation of democracy in the world – it is the most celebrated document on both sides of the Atlantic.

Based on an authentic Magna Carta document older than the Declaration of Independence, the Magna Carta 800th Anniversary Edition includes not only the original 1215 Latin text, but also the beautiful Coats of Arms of the 25 Barons that forced King John in 1215 to accept this document.

For every four 800th Anniversary Editions purchased through the company website, one is donated to a school. Schools in Florida and Massachusetts have been amongst the first to receive their Magna Carta 800th Anniversary Edition. "Our goal is to highlight the relevance of this document to all of us– the senior and younger generations alike – to appreciate the rights and liberties, enshrined in the Constitution, as well as being able to enjoy a stunning piece of 800 year old history and art in our homes and schools," stated Magna Carta World Heritage CEO Laura Kevehazi.
