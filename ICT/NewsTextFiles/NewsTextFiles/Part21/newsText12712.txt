MONTREAL â I read the article about Spencer West published April 24 in The Gazette (â Free the Children ambassador hasn't let amputations slow him down â), which mentions how he spoke to students from six Montreal schools as part of a cross-Canada speaking tour.

When Spencer was only 5 years old, he had his legs amputated below the pelvis because of a genetic disorder. He was told that he would never walk, never sit up, nor ever be a functioning member in society.

Yet, in spite of this disability, Spencer was able to perform an unbelievable feat. In 2012, he climbed Mount Kilimanjaro â on his hands. An unimaginable and unbelievable task. Spencer did it with determination and immense courage.

I, Zoe, was born in 1994, a premature 7-month-old with a twin brother who soon after passed away. Because of complications, I am a victim of cerebral palsy, which limits my ability to walk, to use my hands adequately and to learn like other children.

When I was 5 years old, my teacher and mentor, Sophia Florakas Petsalis, told me that the word âcanâtâ does not exist.

We put it in a box and buried it on Mount Royal. And so, âZoe, yes you canâ became my motto and inspiration.

After that, I was a pupil for six years at the Mackay Centre School. There, I became a public speaker. I performed in competitive sports. I tried to help and support pupils who didnât get sufficient assistance­.

It bothers me immensely, and it makes me cry, that people with special needs are not properly looked after because of staff shortages and insufficient means.

Because my life has not been easy, Iâve become very sympathetic to the problems of others. Iâve always tried to assist my fellow classmates with their schoolwork, with organization and socialization during breaks and lunchtime.

Iâve assisted autistic pupils, by trying to help them become part of daily activities, something which is very difficult to accomplish.

When I graduated from John Grant High School last June, I received both the Ralph Harris Award and the Governor General Award of Canada for first place in academic achievement, awarded to the student with the highest average. I have never let anything, including serious surgeries, get in the way of achieving success.

All this was possible because of my constant effort, determination, and the tremendous support from my mother, Elli, and my grandparents.

There are times when I feel like crying â crying for friendships that end, for problems unsolved, and for what the future holds for people like me.
