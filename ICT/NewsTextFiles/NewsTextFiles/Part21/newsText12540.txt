
U.S. Century Bank sold 14 loans with an original balance of $14.2 million.

U.S. Century Bank sold about $14.2 million in loans, plus a large foreclosure judgment, as it seeks to cure its â€œundercapitalizedâ€� status.

The Doral-based bank, a recipient of a $50.2 million federal bailout, is hoping to raise capital or find a buyer. By getting some loans off the books that makes the bank smaller and reduces the amount of new capital it would require to meet the demands of regulators.

According to court records in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, U.S. Century Bank sold 22 loans on March 31 â€“ the final day of the first quarter â€“ to Waterfall Olympic Master Fund, a Cayman Islands company registered in New York. Those loans were originated for a combined $14.2 million. Itâ€™s not clear what their outstanding balance was on the date of sale or how much U.S. Century Bank received for them.

Its first quarter report showed a $423,000 gain on the sale of loans, which helped it turn a profit during that period.

None of the 14 loans that were sold are currently the subject of foreclosure litigation. The $3.37 million mortgage of Sims & Son, the owner of a Shell service station at 9489 Sheridan Street in Cooper City, was previously in foreclosure but U.S. Century Bank settled the lawsuit and granted it a modified mortgage.

The other larger loans that the bank sold included Royal Gate Centerâ€™s $3.9 million mortgage on a shopping center at 15360 S.W. 280 th Street in Miami-Dade County and Thurff Corp.â€™s $1.33 million mortgage on a gas station at 804 N. State Road 7 in Margate.
