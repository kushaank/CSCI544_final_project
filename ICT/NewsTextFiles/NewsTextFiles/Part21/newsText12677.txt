
Recent figures from the Danish export council Danmarks Eksportråd reveal that Danish exports to Sweden are expected to increase by three percent in 2014 and a further 4.4 percent in 2015.

Those figures mean that exports to Sweden are bouncing back after dipping by 7.5 percent in 2013, and that is an important development, according to experts.

“Sweden might not be the most sexy export market, but measured in billions of kroner, Sweden is essential for Danish exports,” Allan Sørensen, a consultant for industry advocates Dansk Industri, told Børsen business newspaper.

Should the predictions hold true, overall exports to Sweden will rise to 80.1 billion kroner by 2015 and come close to surpassing the all-time export record to Sweden, which was as 80.6 billion kroner in 2012.

In recent years, a stronger Swedish krone has made life difficult for the Swedish export and industry sector, but it has since fallen back again, which spells good news for Danish companies.

But the Swedes are still ahead of the Danes when it comes to growth predictions. OECD indicators expect that Sweden will enjoy growth of 2.8 percent in 2014 and three percent in 2015. The most optimistic growth level predictions for Denmark are at two percent.
