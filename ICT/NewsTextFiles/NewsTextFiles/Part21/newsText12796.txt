
Remarks about an Etobicoke group home for challenged youth who may have autism landed Doug Ford in hot water with several politicians.

“For Doug Ford to express surprise that kids with autism would ‘be leaving the house’ is incredibly out of touch and insensitive,” Tory said.

Ford invited critics to sit down and discuss the matter with him.

“It’s very simple: You don’t ram one of these facilities and put these kids in a community and let them wander off … it can’t be done,” he said.

He also claimed the presence of the group home, which is run by a non-profit called the Griffin Centre. brought down surrounding property value by $150,000 within two months. He said he wants to help find a solution for the Griffin Centre and the neighbourhood.
