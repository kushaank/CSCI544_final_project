
The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) is set to quiz companies operating in the downstream sector of the Nigerian oil industry indicted for manipulating the price of premium motor spirit, also known as fuel, and selling above the approved pump price.

LEADERSHIP findings revealed that the list of the errant companies was forwarded to the anti-graft agency by the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) and appropriate actions will be taken immediately.

However, when the spokesperson for DPR was contacted for comment on the names of the indicted oil companies, she promised to call back but had not done so at the time of filing this report.

Meanwhile, sources at the EFCC disclosed that letters of invitation have been dispatched to the affected companies while a crack team of operatives has been assembled in the commissionâ€™s Extractive Industry Fraud Section to grill the affected oil chiefs.
