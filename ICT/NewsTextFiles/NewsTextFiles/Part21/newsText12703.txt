
The Acting Senior Humanitarian Coordinator (SHC) in the Central African Republic, Kouassi Lazare Etien unequivocally condemns the killing of the French photojournalist Camille Lepage and extends heartfelt condolences to the victim’s family.

Camille Lepage lost her life in the western region of Bouar on 13 May 2014 while on a reporting assignment.

“I am deeply saddened by the loss of this dedicated media professional. In accordance with international humanitarian law, media personnel engaged in armed conflict situations are considered as civilians and must be respected and protected,” said the Acting Humanitarian Coordinator.

“Through their quest and publication of information, journalists help to highlight the needs of the people we are assisting. It is crucial to ensure their safety under all circumstances”, said Mr. Etien.

Camille Lepage published her work on the Central African Republic in numerous media worldwide. Her killing follows the murder of two Central African journalists, Désiré Sayenga and René Padou, at the end of April 2014.

According to the Central African Red Cross, since 5 December 2013, 1,427 people have been killed in attacks by armed militias and 1,144 people wounded. Since September 2013, 12 humanitarian workers have been killed. The conflict in the Central African Republic has left more than 560,000 people internally displaced.
