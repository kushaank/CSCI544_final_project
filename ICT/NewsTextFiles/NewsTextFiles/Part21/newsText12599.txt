
A $900 million underwater tunnel that will give trucks leaving the port of Miami faster access to nearby highways was unveiled today, four years after construction began.

Florida ’s Miami-Dade County sold more than $200 million in revenue bonds this month to help finance construction of the tunnel, which connects the world’s largest cruise-ship hub to Interstate 395.

The tunnel is part of a $2 billion capital-improvement plan at the port, which is preparing for the larger ships that will pass through the Panama Canal after it completes a widening project next year. The port’s debt surpassed $1 billion for the first time this month, as it has ramped up borrowing to pay for a harbor-deepening project and other upgrades.

The port held an “opening ceremony” today, and said the tunnel would soon be open to traffic.

Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the seaport’s debt on May 1 for the second time in less than a year, citing the increased borrowing as a credit risk. The debt is rated Baa1, three steps above junk.

Investors have demanded about 1.5 percentage points of extra yield this year on average to buy Miami-Dade County seaport bonds maturing in October 2029 instead of benchmark debt, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s down from about 1.6 percentage points in the last five months of 2013.
