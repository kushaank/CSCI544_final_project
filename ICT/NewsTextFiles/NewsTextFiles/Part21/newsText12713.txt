
Justin Trudeau could have avoided yet another faux pas. But he’s doubled down and is going full blunder.

He couldn’t have picked a more explosive or polarizing topic either: abortion. This from the guy who derides Harper as divisive!

Trudeau is sticking to his guns on a statement he made the other week that his party would not accept pro-choice candidates.

So he’s reminding us once again that he’s all for open nominations … except in all the cases when he’s not.

Trudeau did acknowledge that current prolife Liberal caucus members, like MP John McKay, would be exempt.

Cardinal Thomas Collins, the Roman Catholic archbishop from Toronto, wrote to Trudeau – who was raised Catholic – to urge he reverse his position.

Trudeau made his comments following a press conference held by the Campaign Life Coalition ahead of the March for Life on Parliament Hill.

Trudeau should’ve just avoided the topic all together.

While the rally had thousands of attendees and polls show many Canadians support some form of a law, the prime minister has made it clear he will not be bringing up the issue.

There are many other ways to deal with this.

Trudeau could have simply expressed his personal views.

Or he could have said that, should he form government, his cabinet would have to vote one way but the backbench was free.

That’s what Paul Martin did with same-sex marriage.

Or he could just leave it as a free vote.

This is the smart option for a matter of conscience.

Issues like abortion aren’t as clear cut along party lines as some people might think.

That’s what Stephen Harper did with the 2012 Stephen Woodworth motion.

We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: Justin Trudeau is way too inexperienced to hold the position he does, let alone be opposition leader or prime minister.

He’s not ready for prime time.
