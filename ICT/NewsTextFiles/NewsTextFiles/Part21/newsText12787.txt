
Experts with the Canadian Forces have been called in to investigate a skydiving incident that killed a 29-year-old woman north of Toronto.

The fatal dive happened just after 7:30 p.m. Saturday on Old Homestead Rd. by Hwy. 48 near Lake Simcoe.

“(The Forces) will do an examination of the parachute to see if there was some malfunction,” York Regional Police Det. Hoyt Miller said Sunday at the Georgina field where the fatality occurred.

He said police still have to identify the next-of-kin and will not be releasing the name of the woman, which will have to be done by the Ontario coroner’s office.
