
KINGSPORT  â€”  Coal is down but not out in the United States, and its future looks better  globally, coal operators and industry operatives were told at the Virginia Coal and Energy Alliance's (VCEA) annual conference,  held Monday at the MeadowView Marriott.

Nationally, coal has been under siege from competition from natural gas plus tighter regulations on coal-fired power from President Barack Obama's administration through the Environmental Protection Agency.

Those regulations have shut down more than 400 coal-fired units, cut coal production 20 percent and cost Appalachia between 4,000 and 5,000 jobs, said  Randy Eminger, south region vice president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity.

The upside, Eminger said, is about 1,000 coal-fired power plants are on the drawing board everywhere from Japan to Germany.

"I believe coal will be part of our energy mix for years to come," said Dan Weekley, Dominion Resources' vice president of corporate affairs. "If not, shame on us. ... If not coal, what else?"

Eminger predicted the next three years will be critical as EPA attempts to impose new Obama-directed guidelines involving greenhouse gas emissions for existing power plants before the president leaves office.
