
Colombia produced 24.5Mt of coal in the first quarter of 2014, a 34% year-on-year increase, according to local press reports.

The growth came despite the operations of the country's second biggest coal miner, Drummond , being suspended for almost three months , Colombia's mines and energy ministry said.

The Alabama-based mining company failed to meet new environmental standards tied to the completion of a US$350mn direct loading facility at its Ci√©naga port on the Caribbean Sea. The government banned the use of large coal barges, a measure that came into effect on January 1, before Drummond had the loading facility ready.

The country saw 13.8t of gold (445,551oz) produced in 1Q14. Full-year gold production in 2013 totaled 55.7t.

Quarterly silver production totaled 3.35t while platinum output reached 248t.
