
Consultants at Beaumont Hospital say they support their Clinical Director's decision to resign over his concerns for psychiatric patients.

Professor Shane O'Neill stood down on Friday because of the admissions policy for a new unit, which will see psychiatric patients admitted through the Emergency Department.

He says the department is frequently overcrowded, and that could be a significant risk to patients.
