
Hackers allegedly tried to improve the climate for Chinese state-run steel companies.

A federal grand jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania indicted five Chinese military hackers this morning in a first-of-its kind cyber economic espionage and trade secret theft case.

Hackers infiltrated the computer networks of six Pennsylvania-based corporations involved in the nuclear power, solar products and metals industries. These businesses include Westinghouse Electric, Alcoa , Allegheny Technologies Incorporated, U.S. Steel, the United Steelworkers Union and SolarWorld.

â€œThe alleged hacking appears to have been conducted for no reason other than to advantage state-owned companies and other interests in China, at the expense of businesses here in the United States,â€� said Attorney General Eric Holder .

Defendants Wang Dong, Sun Kailiang, Wen Xinyu , Huang Zhenyu , and Gu Chunhui , officers in Unit 61398 of the Third Department of the Chinese Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army (PLA), allegedly accessed information belonging to the victim entities in order to obtain potentially useful information for Chinese competitors.

From 2006 to 2014, the accused men of the PLA committed various crimes ranging from aggravated identity theft to robbery of trade secrets against these corporations, the Attorney Generalâ€™s office alleges. The jury charged each defendant in 31 total counts.

The hackers were charged with 13 counts of transmitting a program, information, code, or command with the intent to cause damage to protected computers. Each crime carries a maximum penalty ranging from 5 years to 15 years in prison.

The U.S. Department of Justiceâ€™s National Security Division Counterespionage Section and the U.S. Attorneyâ€™s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania will continue to prosecute the lawsuit.
