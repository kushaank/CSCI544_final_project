DENVER BUSINESS JOURNAL - Aerospace industry leaders, scientists, companies and more will converge Monday for the start of the 30th Space Symposium in Colorado Springs.

The Symposium, which takes place at The Broadmoor Hotel, provides experts and parties from around the world a venue to discuss space travel.

Thousands of people converge to take part in the tours, speaking events, panel discussions, showcasing and award ceremonies at the symposium.

The symposium will reportedly have an initial impact of $30 million for the tourism, hotels and food alone.

And according to a study released last week, aerospace and military spending account for more than half of money spent in the Pikes Peak region.

"The numbers are large," Andy Merritt, the military and space expert for the Colorado Springs Regional Business Alliance, told the Colorado Springs Gazette.
