
The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall flew to Canada yesterday for a whirlwind four-day tour.

Charles and Camilla will visit six communities across three provinces as they take part in events to mark a number of important historical anniversaries.

They include the First World War centenary and the 150th anniversary of the Charlottetown Conference which led to the Canadian Confederation.

The royal couple will arrive in Halifax, Nova Scotia, before travelling to Pictou County; then moving to Charlottetown, Bonshaw and Cornwall in Prince Edward Island and Winnipeg in Manitoba.

During the tour, the Prince and Duchess will have tea with Second World War veterans and Canadian war brides in Halifax, as well as attending a celebration of Celtic culture in Pictou County.

They will visit the Canadian Forces Base in Winnipeg and celebrate the centenary of Winnie the Bear, the cub who inspired A.A Milne's Winnie the Pooh books.

Charles will be given the chance to feed a polar bear at Winnipeg's International Polar Bear Conservation Centre, while Camilla will visit the Royal Winnipeg Ballet to mark its 75th anniversary with a tour of its costume department and dance studios.

In Prince Edward Island, Charles will be presented with an honorary Symons Medal, a national award to recognise ongoing contribution to Canadian society.

The tour will be the third time the royal couple have travelled to Canada together, and the Prince's 17th visit.

Lets waste thousdands of tax payers money on a freebie for Charlie Boy and Vanilla.
