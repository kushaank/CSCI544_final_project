
Former Panera Bread and Bloomin’ Brands Inc. executive Michael J. Nolan has been named executive vice president and chief development officer of Corner Bakery Café, the company said Monday.

In addition, Corner Bakery also promoted Blake Bernet to the position of chief legal officer. Bernet served previously as the Dallas-based chain’s senior vice president and general counsel.

He served most recently as senior vice president and chief development officer, worldwide, for Bloomin’ Brands, directing the global restaurant development strategy for that company’s five brands, including Outback Steakhouse, Bonefish Grill, Carrabba’s Italian Grill, Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse and Roy’s Hawaiian Fusion.

Before that, Nolan spent more than a decade at Panera Bread Co., where he served most recently as senior vice president, chief development officer and managing director for Canada. During his tenure with Panera, Nolan helped grow the concept from 250 units to more than 1,500.

Earlier in his career, Nolan served as senior vice president for John Harvard’s Brew House, and he also served on the board for American Hospitality Concepts Inc. He was a vice president of real estate and development for Applebee’s franchise group, Apple South Inc., and was vice president of real estate and development for Morrison Restaurants Inc.

Bernet joined Corner Bakery in 1996 and previously held the position of general counsel and senior vice president of development. He led the evolution of the building prototype and growth of the brand from 50 to 165 units, the company said.

Currently, 53 Corner Bakery units are franchised, and the company has commitments for more than 350 additional locations, with plans to move into new markets of Alabama, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio and South Carolina.
