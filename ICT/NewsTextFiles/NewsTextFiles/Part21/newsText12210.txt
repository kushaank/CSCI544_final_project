
Kenya: The Government has ordered that all Government vehicles bearing private number plates be refitted with “ GK ” plates to curb misuse.

In a circular to Government institutions, including State House, National Assembly and the Judiciary, Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua ordered the surrender of private number plates issued for the official vehicles.

Kinyua said there are too many Government vehicles bearing private plates, which are being misused to do non-government work, thereby wasting huge amounts of taxpayers’ resources.

Kinyua said the order applies to all Government ministries, parastatals and county governments except those used by officials of the National Intelligence Service and the Criminal Investigation Department.

Â “The private number plates should be returned to the Registrar of Motor Vehicles for safe custody. This instruction must be complied with fully, “ he said.

The Head of Government Vehicle Unit is under instruction to detain and report any Government vehicle having private number plates to Kinyua’s office. The deadline expired last month.

“Principal Secretaries are expected to ensure that the CEOs of parastatals under their ministries return any private registration numbers issued to them. They should also report on their full compliance with this directive,” said Kinyua.

“Over the years, there have been numerous requests for issuance of private number plates mostly on security grounds. Following closer re-examination of the security consideration, it has been concluded that the private numbers do not offer a greater security advantage than GK numbers do,” he asserted.

Kinyua admitted that Government vehicles with private number plates are more likely to be misused to run private errands contrary to the code of regulations.
