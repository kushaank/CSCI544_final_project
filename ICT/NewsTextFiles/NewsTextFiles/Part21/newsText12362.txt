
Washingtonians are more likely to walk to work than residents of almost any city in the country.

According to a new top 10 list from the 24/7 Wall St. website, Washington ranks second in the U.S. for walking residents , with about 12 percent â€” or about one in eight â€” of people getting to their jobs on foot. Using recently released Census Bureau data from 2012, about 38 percent of Washington residents have no car, the blog said. The District had the 9th highest Walk Score of cities reviewed at 74.1. And that's with one of the highest population densities in the country, more than 6,388 people per square mile.

Walk Score is a company that provides walkability information via its website. Walk Score also ranked Washington as one of the most walkable in the nation in November. Neighborhoods such as Dupont Circle, Chinatown and the U Street corridor were among the most walkable areas of the city based on access to public transit, commute times, bike friendliness and proximity to amenities.

The nationâ€™s capital ranked just behind Boston and just ahead of Pittsburgh for walking to work.

In Boston, about one in six people walk to work, with about 37 percent of households not owning a car. The population density of the metro area is 7,980 people per square mile. Just more than 11 percent of Pittsburgh residents walk to work, with 24 percent of households not owning a car. The city earned a walk score of nearly 60 percent.
