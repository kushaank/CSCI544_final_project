
The Nashville market isnâ€™t short of banks, with scores of lenders competing for business in the region.

On top of the more than 30 locally based banks, outside players as large as JPMorgan Chase and PNC Financial have planted flags in the Nashville area.

Alongside those national lenders, other out-of-state banks, such as Republic Bank of Kentucky and ServisFirst out of Birmingham, Ala.. have entered Middle Tennessee.

Most recently, Simmons First National Bank out of Arkansas acquired the parent company of First State Bank , a Union City, Tenn. lender that has $329.7 million of deposits in the Nashville MSA. One reason for the acquisition: To enter the Nashville market.

Rick Hart , the Tennessee president of Renasant Bank , said that while competitive, Nashville promises more opportunities for banks than other regions in the country. The prospect for future growth means Nashville can sustain the various competitors in the market, he said.
