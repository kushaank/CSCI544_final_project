
Happening today, two Lowndes County sanitation companies are going head to head for an appeal in state supreme court. Advanced Disposal is fighting to keep their exclusive contact with the county, pushing Deep South Sanitation out.

A judge ruled in favor of the young sanitation business, Deep South, continue to operate and since their competitor has been doing what they can to reverse that decision.

It all unraveled back in February when Lowndes County sued Deep South Sanitation from picking up trash after the county commission put together a contract that stated that they would only do business with long time company, Advanced Disposal.

Commissioner, Bill Slaughter says by working exclusively with Advanced they would be saving the county money.

However for Cary Scarborough, owner of Deep South, it that would put him out of his business, something he has been building up for the last 4 years.
