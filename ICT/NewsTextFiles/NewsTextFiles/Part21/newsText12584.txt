DEXTER — The Dexter Schools Board of Education approved the preliminary budget plan for the 2014-15 year at its Monday, May 12 board meeting.

According to a memorandum from Chief Financial Officer Sharon Raschke, the Finance Committee set a target of approximately $600,000 revenue under expenses for the school district next year. However, to reach that target, about $900,000 in budget reductions and/or revenue enhancements are needed.

Also, the plan sets parameters for next year’s budget, including an $83 increase in foundation allowance, which is varying levels of money from state government and from local property taxes based on the number of students enrolled in the district.

Because this is a preliminary plan, the budget will not be finalized until June, when there will be a budget hearing and final budget adoption.

The Board continued to examine finance later in the meeting as they discussed the financial summary report and narrative. This is the first draft of the report, which will be a monthly financial update to the Board.

The new report divides the finance school by school and department by department. Also, it was created with a new organizational system that uses the budget in a different way than in the past.

The Board then discussed the Washtenaw Educational Options Consortium Agreement, a plan that involves all public schools in the county.

Timmis and the superintendents of the other schools involved have spent the past year developing the agreement, and Timmis said he is comfortable with what they came up with.

In other business, Wylie Elementary's Rich Wines was honored for recently being awarded the 2014 Michigan Education Association's Leon A. Browner Award.

The Leon A. Brunner Award is given to an educational support professional who has made significant contributions to Educational Support Personnel and has exhibited a high degree of commitment to Education Support Personnel.

The Board will vote on the agreement at the next Board meeting, which will be held 7 p.m. Tuesday, May 27 at the Creekside media center.
