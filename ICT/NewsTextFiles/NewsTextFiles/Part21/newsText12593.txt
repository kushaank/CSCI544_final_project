
CUMMING, Ga. — The 13-year-old founder of a nonprofit that provides soldiers and veterans' families with school supplies, food and personal items was honored with two national youth organization awards earlier this month.

Remington Youngblood founded Change 4 Georgia, a youth-led nonprofit that aims to inspire young people to get involved in their communities.

"The difference between dreaming and real life is taking action," said Youngblood. "If you can dream it, you can find a way to do it."

Youngblood was recently awarded the Prudential Spirit of Community Award and the Hasbro Community Action Hero Award.

The Prudential Spirit of Community Award gives $1,000 to two students from each state at the middle and high school level and flies them and a chaperone to Washington, D.C. for three nights and four days of first-class events and tours, including visiting monuments and meeting senators.

Youngblood, a seventh-grader at Riverwatch Middle School, was a Georgia middle school honoree.

Kathy Carpenter, principal at Riverwatch Middle School, nominated Youngblood for the award.

The award, sponsored by Prudential Financial and the National Association of Secondary School Principals, recognizes volunteer community service by young adults.

"Young people who contribute their time and talents to their communities are role models for all of us," said Prudential Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Strangfeld. "We salute their dedication, their achievements and their spirit of community."

Youngblood also received the Hasbro Community Action Hero Award for his latest Change 4 Georgia initiative  a new and used book drive that collects books and then donates them to libraries, Title I-funded schools and military veterans and their families.

The Hasbro award ceremony was held in New York, where Youngblood along with five other volunteers were recognized.

"As we celebrate the fifth anniversary of this award, we are thrilled to recognize these young change-makers who are creating real and lasting improvements to our world," said Brian Goldner, president and chief executive officer of Hasbro.

Youngblood's mother, Rebecca Youngblood, nominated him for the Hasbro award, which recognized Change 4 Georgia's Building by Books drive. The book drive was inspired by Georgia First Lady Sandra Deal and her Read Across Georgia initiative.

Many local authors have also donated signed books to the cause.

Youngblood came back from D.C. and New York inspired, his mother said.

"His head is full of ideas," she said.

To date, Change 4 Georgia has collected more than 2,500 books and raised $92,000 in cash and in-kind donations from over 100 businesses supporting their efforts.

Youngblood is also an inspirational and motivational speaker who has received invitations to speak at over 80 venues. He travels to elementary schools to teach children about the importance of community service and how they can help.
