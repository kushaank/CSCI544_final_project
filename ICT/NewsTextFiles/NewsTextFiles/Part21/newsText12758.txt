
As many as 78 cars were damaged in a tire-slashing spree in Santa Monica — all in one night. Whit Johnson reports from Santa Monica for the NBC4 News at 6 on Monday, May 19, 2014.

Dozens of cars in a residential neighborhood in Santa Monica had their tires slashed over the weekend, police said.

A line of cars parked on streets and in lots in Ocean Park were damaged Saturday night into Sunday morning, Santa Monica police said.

Neighbors said they were notified by the Automobile Club of Southern California that as many as 78 cars had been vandalized in the tire-slashing spree that took place on Hollister Avenue between Ocean Avenue and Main Street ( map ).

Some cars had multiple tires slashed, leaving angry and frustrated residents with a hefty repair bill.

“Mine are going to cost $200 – just for one tire,” said victim Russell Braunstein.

Steve Clark, who is visiting from Canada, found his rental car sitting lower to the ground. He will be forced to foot the bill.

Police said they were searching for surveillance video in hopes of finding clues about whoever is responsible. Surveillance images (below) from a motel on Ocean Avenue captured the "tire slasher" in the act.
