
AAA is projecting the number of California travelers over the upcoming Memorial Day weekend will be the highest since the start of the recession.

Nearly 4.3 million Californians plan on traveling 50 miles or more over the three-day weekend, up 1.8 percent from last year, according to AAA’s recent travel survey.

“Californians are hitting the roads and planning their getaways for the official summer travel kick-off,” said Pablo O’Brien, vice president of travel products for AAA Northern California. He attributed the increased traffic due to the “economic upturn,” which has boosted consumer confidence and spending.

AAA projects that more than 3.5 million Californians will drive to their destinations, more than 400,000 will fly and nearly 300,000 will travel by other modes of transportation, including rail, bus and cruises.

Nationally, AAA projects that more 36 million people will journey 50 miles or more during the Memorial Day weekend, a 1.5 percent increase over last year.

AAA projections are based on research by IHS Global Insight, the Boston-based economic research and consulting firm.
