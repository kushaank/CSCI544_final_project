
Canada is opening four new trade offices in China.

That brings to 15 the number of Canadian trade offices in the country.

Trade Minister Ed Fast announced the new offices while in China on a trade mission.

The announcement comes on the heels of a new plan to embed 25 trade commissioners inside Canadian companies.

The federal government hopes that doing so will help co-ordinate its efforts and programs with the companies that can best make use of them.

The four new offices, which are expected to open this fall, will be located in different parts of China, although specific cities were not identified in a news release.
