“Johnson Controls, the biggest U.S. auto-parts maker, will retain its seating business," spokesman Fraser Engerman said in an interview with Bloomberg.

“Yanfeng will own 70 percent of the new Shanghai-based venture, with Johnson Controls owning the remainder, the companies said in a statement. It will have revenue of about $7.5 billion, according to the companies.

The move comes as Johnson Controls has been refocusing efforts on its building-effiency unit. In January, the company agreed to sell its electronics business to Visteon Corp. and consider options for its unprofitable interiors unit, which makes door and instrument panels.

Based in Plymouth, Mich., JCI’s Interiors Division makes door panels, instrument panels, visors, headliners and other non-seating automotive components. Company officials said the Interiors Division lost $13 million in fiscal 2013 on sales of $4.2 billion.

With more than 3,000 employees, JCI has been part of West Michigan’s business landscape since 1996, when the company purchased the Prince Corp. for $1.35 billion after the 1995 death of company founder Edgar Prince.
