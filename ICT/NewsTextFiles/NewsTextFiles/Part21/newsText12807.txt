
Quebec provincial police stopped a vehicle that was speeding Monday morning, and discovered the lead-foot, litterbug driver was hammered.

It happened around 11:30 a.m. when a patrol officer spotted the vehicle going more than 105 km/h in an ​70 km/h area of Hwy. 5 North near the Hwy. 50/Maisonneuve Blvd. exchange.

When the suspect saw the officer, he quickly tossed a can through the passenger-side window, police say. The vehicle was stopped about a kilometer up the road.

The driver, a 31-year-old man from Gatineau was arrested and taken back to the station.

He was released on summons for court on Aug. 6. Drunk driving charges are pending.

In addition to having his licence suspended for a period of 90 days, he received two $690 tickets and three demerit points.
