
Mombasa, Kenya: Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) has so far spent $27 million (Sh2.35b) to install security system at the port of Mombasa.

KPA chairman, Mr Danson Mungatana said recent changes in International Maritime standards have created the need to assess and improve the status of security in the Kenyan ports.

He said it is imperative that the port’s authority invests heavily in security and to ensure its human capital is empowered to provide adequate security for port users.

This, he added, demands high level of training for KPA officers entrusted with security responsibility as part of the ports compliance with the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code.

“It is surely with this in mind that KPA has invested heavily in ensuring that its security personnel are well trained as is evident with the graduates who are passing out today, “Mungatana said.

Mungatana made the remarks while officiating at a special passing out parade and graduation of KPA security personnel at the Kenya Wildlife Service Law Enforcement Academy at Manyani, Taita Taveta County on Friday.
