
Where does John Walsh stand on Montana’s economy? Clearly he does not care for the coal industry or any industry that supports developing our abundant natural resources. Our newly appointed U.S. Senator recently attended a rally in Billings with folks advocating the end of Montana’s coal industry and, for that matter, the entire fossil fuel industry. Never mind Forsyth, Colstrip, Rosebud, Ashland, Hysham and the many other outlying communities that are home to the workers at our regional coal mines or coal fired power plants. Many of these towns also receive benefit from the plants directly through either the coal board or oil and natural gas revenues. This funding is instrumental in completing many necessary public works projects for smaller communities that would otherwise find the funding through direct taxation.

The imposition of new regulations would have a massively negative impact on the people who live here. The businesses and the general welfare of these communities in their entirety would be drastically reduced if not decimated by the actions of those that seek to use government and regulation to cripple a people and their local economy.

No one is advocating substituting development for our environment. However, we understand the benefit that coal, along with other natural resources, brings to Montanan’s with jobs, tax revenue, and energy prices.
