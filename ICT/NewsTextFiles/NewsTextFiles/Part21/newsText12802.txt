REGINA -- The Regina Fire Department is looking into what caused a fire that severely damaged two houses early Sunday morning.

Fire department spokesman Gerard Kay said Regina Police Service members noticed the fire at 5:46 a.m. and radioed it in, bringing fire crews to the scene.

When crews arrived, there were intense flames coming from the majority of 1724 Toronto St. which spread to the upstairs and attic area of the house next door at 1728. Both are two-storey homes.

Kay said one male had to be taken to hospital with burns to one or both arms although the injuries arenât believed to be life-threatening. A dog and a cat died in the fire and a total of three people were treated, the fire department reported.

A family member said the person burned was a five-year-old boy who received burns to both arms. He has since been released from hospital and is staying with relatives.

Meanwhile, no one was at home at the house next door, which was split into two separate rental properties, one of which was unoccupied. Two cats reported to have lived in that house hadnât been found within the few hours that followed the call.

Kay said itâs still too early to say what caused the fire, although the possibility of its being suspicious hadnât been ruled out. A fire investigator was on scene Sunday morning and the Regina Police Service had also come on board with the investigation by later that day.

Itâs believed damage to the houses will exceed $300,000 each with neither home habitable any longer. The house at 1724 was believed to have been more or less gutted by the fire while the house next door lost approximately half of its roof in the blaze.
