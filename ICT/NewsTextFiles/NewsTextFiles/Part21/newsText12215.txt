
Digital video brand advertising company YuMe has appointed Philippe de Passorio as its new country manager for France. De Passorio joined augmented reality advertising solutions company Total Immersion in 2006 as vice president of marketing and sales, EMEA, before setting up the company's Asian headquarters in Hong Kong in 2009. Four years later he co-founded the viral marketing platform Stampeo, which was recently acquired. "French TV brand advertisers face the exact issue every TV brand advertiser faces â audiences who are increasingly distracted and fragmented," said de Passorio. "I'm looking forward to helping French agencies and brand advertisers solve the issue with a data science approach to reaching those audiences across multi-screens." US-based YuMe, has its European headquarters in London and 11 other offices worldwide.
