
VANCOUVER (NEWS1130) – The BC Civil Liberties Association has filed written arguments in its legal battle for the right to doctor-assisted suicide.

At 67-year-old Elayne Shapray suffers from MS and she is a plaintiff in the case.

Shapray won’t be able to travel to the Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa in October to hear the case because of her MS.

Lee Carter, another plaintiff whose mother received a doctor-assisted suicide in Switzerland, says that Canadians suffering from chronic, debilitating conditions should not have to travel elsewhere to end their pain.

Anne Fomenoff, the mother of deceased high-profile plaintiff Gloria Taylor, says that her family will continue to fight for the right to a dignified death to honour her daughter’s memory.

The BC Civil Liberties Association will be presenting its case in court on Oct. 14.

Last October, the BC Court of Appeal overturned a 2012 decision by the BC Supreme Court ruling that the existing law banning assisted suicide was unconstitutional and that Taylor be granted an exemption to the law that would allow her to seek assisted death.
