
ORRICK, Mo. — As tornado victims work to return their lives to normal, some are complaining about their insurance company.

A Ray County Commissioner said he’s received a number of complaints from storm victims claiming their insurance company has been slow to respond to the tornado damage.

A lot of homeowners suffered damage to their roofs, and with more rain expected later this week, many would like to get repairs made before their problems get worse.

Some insurance companies have disaster response teams in Orrick. And many people have told FOX 4 News their insurance company has been great. They were out the day after the storm and cut a check for them almost immediately to make repairs.

But Ray County Commissioner Mike Twyman said he’s received complaints about one company, Concordia Farmers Mutual. Twyman claims it took the company several days to begin to inspect damage in Orrick, and some customers have told FOX 4 News they met with an adjuster a week after the storm struck.

FOX 4 News talked with several Concordia Farmers Mutual customers who say they’re not satisfied with the company’s response to the storm. But none of them wanted to appear on camera, fearing that it could affect how much money they eventually receive for their claim. Some have filed complaints with Missouri’s Insurance Commissioner, who is now investigating the response.

Concordia Farmers Mutual President Connie Costigan says the insurer had an adjuster in Orrick on Monday following the Saturday storm. The company called in extra adjusters on Wednesday of last week.

Costigan said the company is evaluating the worst damaged homes first and is making its way to those with minor damage.
