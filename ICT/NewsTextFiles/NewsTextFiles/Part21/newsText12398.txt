
ZURICH (dpa-AFX) - Credit Suisse Group AG (CS) pleaded guilty to conspiracy to aid and assist U.S. taxpayers in filing false income tax returns and other documents with the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Justice Department said Monday.

As part of the plea agreement, Credit Suisse acknowledged that, for decades prior to and through 2009, it operated an illegal cross-border banking business that knowingly and willfully aided and assisted thousands of U.S. clients in opening and maintaining undeclared accounts and concealing their offshore assets and income from the IRS.

The plea agreement, which was filed in the Eastern District of Virginia, provides that Credit Suisse will pay a total of $2.6 billion, including $1.8 billion to the Department of Justice for the U.S. Treasury, $100 million to the Federal Reserve and $715 million to the New York State Department of Financial Services.

Earlier this year, Credit Suisse paid approximately $196 million in disgorgement, interest and penalties to the Securities and Exchange Commission for violating the federal securities laws by providing cross-border brokerage and investment advisory services to U.S. clients without first registering with the SEC.  That settlement with the SEC is also reflected in Monday's plea agreement.

'This case shows that no financial institution, no matter its size or global reach, is above the law,' said Attorney General Eric Holder.  'Credit Suisse conspired to help U.S. citizens hide assets in offshore accounts in order to evade paying taxes.  When a bank engages in misconduct this brazen, it should expect that the Justice Department will pursue criminal prosecution to the fullest extent possible, as has happened here.'

Credit Suisse is the largest bank to plead guilty in 20 years.
