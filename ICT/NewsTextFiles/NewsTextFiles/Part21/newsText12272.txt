DecaWave was awarded top prize in the most successful business financed by early- stage investors category.

In his presentation, chief executive Ciaran Connell detailed how he managed to secure investment of €20 million from more than 171 different angel investors from Ireland , Britain, the US and France .

This is the first time the congress, now the largest event of its kind in Europe , as been staged in Ireland and it drew more than 350 elite business angels and investors from Europe and the US to Dublin.

“We were delighted to see a local winner of a major European award. DecaWave is an inspirational Irish success and a unique example of how it is possible to build a well financed business with serious global ambitions, backed by such a large number of angel investors,” said HBAN national director Michael Culligan .
