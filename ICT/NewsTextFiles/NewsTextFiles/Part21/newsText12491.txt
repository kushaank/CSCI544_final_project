
Gold shipments to Southeast Asia’s biggest consumer are forecast to contract by as much as half this year, a sign the unprecedented Asian demand that helped stem last year’s rout in prices is weakening.

Thailand’s purchases may be 150 to 200 metric tons because of falling prices and the country’s political crisis, according to YLG Bullion International Co., the largest local importer. They fell 78 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier and totaled 314 tons in 2013, valued at about $13 billion.

Consumption across Asia reached a record in 2013 even as some investors in the U.S. and Europe lost their faith in bullion as a store of value. Prices snapped a 12-year bull market, the longest in at least nine decades. Holdings in exchange-traded products backed by gold are contracting and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. says prices will keep retreating.

Gold consumption in Thailand, the biggest user in Asia after China and India, expanded 73 percent to 140.1 tons last year, according to World Gold Council data. Imports were higher than local consumption in 2013 as some bullion was re-exported, including jewelry.

World consumer demand rose 21 percent to 3,864 tons in 2013 as usage in China, the largest, surged 32 percent to 1,065.8 tons, an all-time high. Across Asian countries tracked by the council, including India, China, Japan and Southeast Asia, consumption expanded 25 percent to 2,434 tons.

Imports by India, the second-largest consumer, may total 650 tons to 700 tons in the 12 months started April 1 from 650 tons a year earlier, Rajesh Khosla, the managing director of MMTC-PAMP India Pvt., the country’s biggest refiner, said last month. The government will probably keep some form of curbs on imports after the elections to control the current account deficit and defend the rupee, he said in an interview.
