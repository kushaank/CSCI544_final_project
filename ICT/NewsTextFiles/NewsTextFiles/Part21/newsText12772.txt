
Construction to widen Whitehorse's Robert Campbell Bridge for cyclists begins Monday.

The City of Whitehorse says work will be adjusted to avoid affecting traffic as much as possible.

The bridge over the Yukon River is the only route into the Riverdale subdivision and traffic there slows to a crawl during rush hour .

"We don't want to interrupt the 20 minutes worth of congestion in the morning, so they'll be working around the traffic as necessary."

Currently, the bridge walkway is too narrow for cyclists to pass pedestrians. The city received a grant from the Build Canada fund to build the walkway a metre wider on each side of the bridge  to add bike lanes .

The connection between the Millennium Trail and the Robert Service Way Trail will also be improved.

If all goes as planned, the $1.7-million project will be complete in September.
