Prime Minister John Key has confirmed he will visit the White House to meet with President Barack Obama next month.

The visit will take place in Washington DC on June 20 as part of a four-day trip to the US, where Mr Key will be in New York to lobby for New Zealand to have a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council for 2015/16.

Mr Key says the talks "underline the very close relationship" between the two countries and will discuss, among other things, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

But what will "absolutely not" be on the agenda is a talk about the use of drone strikes or mass surveillance.

"There'd be no reason to do that," Mr Key told reporters this morning.

"President Obama has used drones and that’s a matter for them, but under the circumstances I consider they’ve been used, for the most part I'm comfortable."

He did not see any particular reason why he would ask for an assurance from President Obama the National Security Agency (NSA) wasn't spying on New Zealanders.

But Labour leader David Cunliffe says Mr Key should raise the issue of drone strikes during the meeting and would do it if he were Prime Minister.

"I would be seeking to clarify whether there are any limits on the purposes on which New Zealand supplied intelligence and I would be seeking some assurances that activities which pertained to New Zealand supplied intelligence were compatible with both the rule of New Zealand law and international law," Mr Cunliffe says.

Mr Key should also seek the same assurances from the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), Mr Cunliffe says.

While in the capital, Mr Key will also meet with a number of senior administrative figures, Congressional representatives and business leaders.
