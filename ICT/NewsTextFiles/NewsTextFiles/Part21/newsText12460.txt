
REMITTANCES from overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) and revenues from the business-process outsourcing (BPO) industry are expected to double the Philippines economy by 2030, according to an expert from IHS, a global consultancy firm.

IHS Asia-Pacific chief economist Rajiv Biswas also said a more robust manufacturing sector, which the government is seeking to revive, would help transform the Philippines economy into a trillion-dollar economy in less than two decades.

“The Philippines economy has the capacity for robust long-term economic growth of around 4.5 percent to 5 percent per year, over the 2016-to-2030 time horizon. This will transform the Philippines economy from its current $280-billion economy to a $680-billion economy by 2024, with a projected GDP [gross domestic product] of $1.2 trillion by 2030,” Biswas said.

“The long-term outlook for the future development of the Philippines will be heavily dependent on the ability to make the manufacturing sector more competitive and to mobilize both foreign and domestic investment flows into the manufacturing sector. This will require considerable improvement of the business climate, with the Philippines still ranked very low globally on the World Bank’s “Ease of Doing Business rankings,” Biswas said.

Last week Trade Secretary Gregory L. Domingo cited the resurgence of the manufacturing sector in 2013 as a signal that it might become a major proponent of economic growth.

It was the fastest-growing industry in the Philippines last year, pushing the full-year growth to 10.5 percent, nearly doubling 2012’s growth of 5.4 percent and leading over services for the entire year of 2013.

The IT-BPO sector is expected to rise by 16 percent in 2014, while OFW remittances this year may grow by as much as 8.5 percent, according to Standard Chartered. The IT and Business Process Association of the Philippines (itbap) expects the IT-BPO industry to hit a revenue base of $25 billion in 2016.

Remittances by an estimated 8 million to 10 million OFWs, according to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, grew by 6.5 percent to hit $1.88 billion in March, the highest so far in 2014.

Despite Biswas’s rosy projections, however, he said the Philippines still has a lot of work to do, particularly in addressing development challenges, such as poverty and unemployment.

“Poverty and unemployment remain very high in the Philippines, with around 28 percent of the population still living in poverty according to government estimates, while the total number of unemployed or underemployed workers exceeds 10 million,” Biswas noted.

He said these problems could only be addressed through sustained high economic growth. This growth must also be fueled by increased Foreign Direct Investments (FDI), particularly those geared toward the manufacturing and tourism sectors.

Under Biswas’s projections, total GDP per capita in the Philippines would rise from around $2,800 in 2014 to around $5,800 by 2024. This would contribute to the growth of the middle class in the coming years.

In the short term, IHS also forecasts that the Philippines economy would grow at 6.2 percent in 2014 and 6 percent in 2015. These figures, however, are lower than government targets, which is to attain a GDP growth of 6.5 percent  to 7.5 percent this year and a 7-percent to 8-percent growth next year.

“This has considerable implications for the size of the Philippines consumer economy. These significant increases in per-capita GDP will create one of Asean’s largest consumer markets of the future, as the middle class rapidly expands over time,” Biswas said.

Data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) showed that the country’s poverty incidence, in terms of population, was at 24.9 percent in the first semester of 2013. In terms of families, poverty incidence declined to 19.1 percent in the same period.

Further, the country’s unemployment rate was at 7.5 percent, meaning around 3 million Filipinos do not have jobs. The underemployment rate, on the other hand, was high at around 19.5 percent, which translates to around 7 million Filipinos looking for better employment opportunities.

The lack of decent employment opportunities has been touted as one of the major reasons for high income inequality in the Philippines. The PSA data showed that the income of the richest Filipinos is 11 times that of the poorest.

The PSA data showed that the poorest 10 percent of Filipinos earned roughly P187 a day in the first semester of 2013, higher than P167 per day in 2012.

The 10th decile, on the other hand, earned a total of P363,829 in the first semester of 2013, a 0.3-percent increase from the P361,863 in the same period in 2012.  This means that the richest Filipinos earned P2,038 a day in the first semester of 2013. This is roughly 11 times that of the daily income of the poor in 2013.
