Chinese search giant Baidu also opened an AI research center in Silicon Valley in 2013 and now, the company has announced that Andrew Ng, who was appointed by Google to oversee the design of Google Brain, will be the head for both its Sunnyvale lab and its Beijing R&D center.

It has not been made clear yet that what Ng will be working on, but it is a possibility that he might play a role in improving the company's Chinese to English translation service, ad placement technology and its voice search service.

"I'm really excited about the opportunity to build an international research organization from scratch. I've been super excited about AI for a long time, and this is an opportunity for me to return to that", Ng told Wired.

Ng was born in England in 1976 and he is an accomplished specialist in artificial intelligence. He is an associate professor of computer science at Stanford University and has previously helped in development of popular software platforms for robots called ROS and the Stanford Autonomous Helicopter project.

According to Baidu, Ng will play the role of a chief scientist at their artificial intelligence research labs, located in Bejing, and Sunnyvale, California.

Ng also provided assistance in creation of Coursea, an online teaching tool, to bring higher education to the masses. Dozens of colleges use the tool to offer full courses online.

Baidu is the most famous search engine in the world's most-populous country. The company has revealed that it is not looking forward to capture the American market in near future.
