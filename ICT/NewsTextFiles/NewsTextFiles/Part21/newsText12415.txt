
The 2014 free Nightfall Concert Series continues its schedule of summer musical programming Friday at Miller Plaza with a headline show by Pokey LaFarge at 8 p.m. Opening at 7 p.m. will be the 9th Street Stompers. Nightfall is hosted each Friday at Miller Plaza through Aug. 29.

Pokey LaFarge is a musician, songwriter, bandleader, entertainer, innovator and preservationist, whose arsenal of talents has placed him at the forefront of American music. From St. Louis Mississippi, Pokey and his band bring a focus and energy to the American Roots genre with infectious material that sits at the crossroads of early jazz, country blues and western swing. With his effortless charisma and magnetic charm, Pokey has crafted a genre all his own.

Opening the Nightfall show at 7 p.m. is the 9th Street Stompers. Hailing from Chattanooga, their sound is based on the gypsy jazz they associate with the Big Nine era in Chattanooga. They cull up the musical scenery of an era when swing, gypsy jazz, blues, rockabilly, and tango were all encompassed with the lifestyle of hard times, big music and big dancing. They have captured the look, sound and feel of early 20th-century American music, and bring it to life on stage.

One promotion made available again this year is the sale of discount ticket booklets, good for beer and wine. Each booklet contains twenty tickets and costs $80 (this is a 20 percent savings off the regular ticket price.) The ticket booklets will be sold at the Nightfall shows through the end of June. These tickets save time and money by allowing ticket holders to avoid the regular ticket lines at Nightfall, and simply get their wristbands with a photo ID.
