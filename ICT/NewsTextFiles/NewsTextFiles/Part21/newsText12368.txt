
Business Report is making its first ever foray into digital broadcasting today, with the launch of a daily business show on CliffCentral.com, a new multi-platform broadcaster which debuted at the beginning of this month.

The show, called Candid Business, will be anchored by Business Report editor Ellis Mnyandu, who will also be its executive producer.

Candid Business will be co-produced and co-hosted by Arnie Hicks, a broadcaster and marketer. “This show takes Business Report to the global stage, and it is our way of taking the African business story to the world,” said Mnyandu.
