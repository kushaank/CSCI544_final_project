
AstraZeneca has rejected a final Â£69bn takeover offer from US drugs giant Pfizer, saying it undervalued the company.

The UK-based pharmaceuticals firm spurned the latest advance from the Viagra maker after it upped the price it was prepared to pay over the weekend.

AstraZeneca said the deal would bring âuncertainty and riskâ for its shareholders and âundervalues the company and its attractive prospectsâ.

He said that from the time of initial talks in January, the US company had âfailed to make a compelling strategic, business or value caseâ.
