In a colossal deal that further illuminates the consolidation of the telecommunications industry, AT&T announced last night that it has agreed to purchase DirecTV in a transaction totaling $48.5 billion.

The acquisition combines the two companies’ “complementary strengths” -- DirecTV’s satellite leadership and AT&T’s vast wireless reach -- according to a press release, especially as viewers are increasingly consuming video content on their mobile devices.

The deal will also allow AT&T to bundle DirecTV with the mobile and broadband services it already offers to consumers, as well as for DirecTV to offer Internet to its 20 million customers for the first time.
