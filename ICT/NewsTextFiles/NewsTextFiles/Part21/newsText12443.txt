
PETALING JAYA (May 19): The search and recovery of the missing Malaysia Airlines's MH370 has started moving into a new phase - deep-sea search.

"As deliberated in the tripartite meeting in Canberra, a team of hydrographic experts from Malaysia, China and Australia, met over the weekend agreed that an extensive bathymetric survey of the areas provided by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau will be carried out in the Southern Indian Ocean," said Acting Transport Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin in a statement.

He said this survey will be conducted by the Chinese navy vessel, Zhu Kezhen (872).

The vessel is scheduled to sail for the survey area on Wednesday if weather permits, he added.

"On a similar note, a team of technical experts had convened in Canberra to discuss and refine the satellite data, calculations and analysis which have been made available by Inmarsat."

Responding to the recent demands by the next-of-kin for the Inmarsat “raw data”, Hishammuddin said he had instructed the Malaysian Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) to discuss with the company on the release of the data for public consumption.

"This is consistent with our stand for greater transparency and prioritising the interests of the family members of those on board MH370." he added.
