
Experts with the Canadian Forces have been called in to investigate a skydiving incident that killed a 29-year-old woman north of Toronto.

The fatal dive happened just after 7:30 p.m. Saturday on Old Homestead Rd. by Hwy. 48 near Lake Simcoe.

“(The Forces) will do an examination of the parachute to see if there was some malfunction,” York Regional Police Det. Hoyt Miller said Sunday at the Georgina field where the fatality occurred.

He said police still have to identify the next-of-kin and will not be releasing the name of the woman, which will have to be done by the Ontario coroner’s office.

“Our role is assisting the coroner,” Miller said.

Friends of the woman from the Parachute School of Toronto, located at the Baldwin Airport, visited the crash site with flowers on Sunday but declined comment.

“We are in mourning and there aren’t many clues. For whatever reason there may have been a problem with the main parachute and the reserve parachute deployed too low,” Adam Mabbe, of the parachute school, said.

“Consulting experts with the Canadian Forces are examining the gear and we will wait and see what they determine,” he said.

Mabbe said the woman was an advanced skydiver with more than 250 jumps.

Last summer a man who had a jump arranged by the school died after a fall in the area.

In August 2002, another man died on a jump with the school when his main and reserve chutes failed to open.
