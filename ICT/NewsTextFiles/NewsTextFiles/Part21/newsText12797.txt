
Trevor Greenway/Metro La Peche Mayor Robert Bussiere isn't cheering these days after the province's ministry of natural resources took away all the turkey he hunts.

The mayor of a west Quebec town has his feathers ruffled after learning the province has seized all his wild turkeys.

La Peche Mayor Robert Bussiere usually spends his spring mornings calling turkeys into his line of sight, and then pulls the trigger on the big birds. But he’s hung up his gun for this season and won’t bring a bird home for Thanksgiving, as he says Quebec’s ministry of natural resources has snatched up all his gobblers and moved them elsewhere in the province.

The long-time mayor personally brought thousands of the birds into the municipality – about 30 kilometers north of Ottawa – a decade ago so he could hunt them and others could spot them across the region. Now, it seems, his turkey dream is over.

“It’s no good,” said an upset Bussiere.

The turkeys were apparently causing a nuisance on nearby farmer’s fields – eating up hay, oats and corn crops.

You might say the move has Bussiere in an especially fowl mood.

Bussiere said while on a normal hunt, he would usually come across 60-80 turkeys and wait for a rare bird to waltz into his crosshairs, but this year that number is down to just two or three.

He understands farmer’s crop concerns, but argues that turkeys are not the only birds causing country headaches.

Bussiere said he won’t give up on his dream and will approach the ministry after this year’s season to see if there is a way to address his concerns.
