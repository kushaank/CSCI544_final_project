As part of its policy of increasing employment opportunities for Omani citizens, the Sultanate’s national carrier aims to increase the number of Omanis on its payroll and a recent open day at Sultan Qaboos University in Muscat has provided an ideal focus for Oman Air’s initiative. The open day attracted a healthy response from both students and recent graduates, who were invited to find out more about Oman Air and the vast range of career opportunities it offers. Staff from the airline were on hand to offer advice and guidance and Oman Air’s Chief Officer Human Resources, Dr Rashid Al Ghailani, was impressed by the calibre of those who attended the airline’s stand.

He commented: “Sultan Qaboos University is a highly prestigious institute and the students we met at the recent open day were highly motivated, high achieving and demonstrated great potential for a career within the airline industry.  “We look forward to receiving formal job applications, and to welcoming the successful candidates to Oman Air’s growing workforce.” Around two thirds of Oman Air’s current workforce comprises Omani citizens and the airline aims to increase that figure, in line with the Sultanate of Oman’s policy of Omanisation. This requires employers to provide much-needed employment and career progression opportunities for Oman’s youthful population.
