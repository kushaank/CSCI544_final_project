
Lou Rosamilia thinks people are finally starting to notice Troy, New York again.

"There is a certain momentum and enthusiasm in the air," Rosamilia said of infrastructure, apartment and business developments in the City of Troy.

Rosamilia said he has attended six ribbon cutting events in the last two weeks to celebrate the opening of new businesses, architecture firms, a beverage store and the new offices of the Rensselaer County Regional Chamber of Commerce .

"Empty storefronts are being developed, apartments are being rented out before construction is even complete and start-ups are looking to the area to start businesses," Rosamilia said.

Rosamilia is one of five area mayors who will participate in a panel discussion in Troy Tuesday morning to focus on the state of local municipalities. Other panelists include Rensselaer mayor Daniel Dwyer ; Watervliet mayor Michael Manning ; Cohoes mayor George Primeau ; and Green Island mayor Ellen McNulty-Ryan . The discussion will be moderated by meteorologist Neal Estano of WNYT.

"We're working to prove the atmosphere and show the benefits of removing blight," Rosamilia said. The city's biggest infrastructure problem is an aging transmission line from the Tomhannock Reservoir, he said.

A project that Rosamilia said he'd like to see completed by the end of the year is the One Monument Square riverfront project being developed by Kirchhoff Consigli Construction Management in Albany.
