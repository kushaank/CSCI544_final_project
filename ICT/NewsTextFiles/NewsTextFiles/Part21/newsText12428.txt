
SAN FRANCISCO & CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--( BUSINESS WIRE )-- Tamr,        Inc. , of Cambridge, Mass., a new company founded by big-data serial        entrepreneurs Andy Palmer and Michael Stonebraker, today unveiled        software that dramatically reduces the time-to-value for enterprises        that want to exploit all their data. The announcement was made at the        DataBeat 2014 conference, which runs May 19-20 in San Francisco.

The company also announced today that it has received more than $16        million in financing led by Google Ventures and New Enterprise        Associates (NEA). Rich        Miner of Google Ventures and Peter        Barris from NEA have joined Tamr’s board of directors. They join        database pioneer Jerry        Held , who is chairman of the board, alongside Andy Palmer and        Michael Stonebraker.

Tamr’s scalable platform for data curation lets businesses connect and        enrich all their data, including internal data sources and external        public data sources, as well as feeds from the Internet of Things. In        early customer tests, Tamr was able to connect, curate and prepare        enterprise data in days or weeks, instead of months or quarters. The        Tamr system identifies and connects a massive variety of siloed data        across an enterprise by applying advanced machine learning with the        insight of human guidance.

Tamr’s        system blends machine learning algorithms with human guidance (for        insight into and understanding of the data that only they possess).        Tamr automates most data curation tasks, and enables data stewards and        curators to intelligently assign exceptions to the right data experts,        who collaborate and make the final curation calls using a Tamr        dashboard. Tamr is an “active learning system” that continually learns        the more it’s used, building an institutional memory and data inventory        of bottom-up enterprise information.

Tamr supports RESTful APIs so that an enterprise can use its existing        visualization and data science toolkits on top of Tamr.

The Tamr system has been in commercial development for nearly two years,        which involved working closely with Fortune 1000 customers.

The system is based on research from MIT, UC Berkeley, Brown University, Brandeis University and Qatar        Computing Research Institute. Tamr’s co-founders worked previously at        building large-scale database systems at companies such as Ingres,        Tandem, Vertica Systems, VoltDB and Paradigm4.
