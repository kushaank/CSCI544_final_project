
Kenya: Kenyans living in rural areas may soon access affordable Internet from Pasha Centres, or digital villages, as the Government moves to revive stalled projects.

The Government has outsourced some of its advisory roles in the project to a private firm that will provide the digital centres with support services, the lack of which was cited as contributing to their failure the first time round.

According to Mr Kwame Shiroya, the official in charge of the digital villages projects at the Kenya ICT Authority (ICTA), the move to revamp the digital villages project (DVP) is in keeping with the recommendations of a report by audit firm Deloitte East Africa, which was contracted to look into the factors that caused their under-performance.

“ICTA has recruited a business development firm to develop common minimum business standards and ways of operating to enhance efficiency and quality,” he said.

In addition, The Youth Banner, the appointed consultant, will provide a supervisory role to Pasha managers, monitoring how they develop their service offerings and work with other providers.

Launched in 2010 by the former ministry of Information permanent secretary, Dr Bitange Ndemo, DVP was considered a novel initiative that would help bridge the technology divide in the country.

The idea was to have information hubs set up in rural areas where users could access various Internet services, including email, web browsing, Internet calls and IT learning.

The Pasha Centres were supposed to be run by entrepreneurs who were to get subsidised loans from the Government (at 10 per cent interest) through a revolving fund.

The landing of multiple undersea fibre cables was expected to further boost broadband penetration and facilitate Internet connection in rural areas.
