Jordan Belfort, whose memoir The Wolf of Wall Street was turned into a film by Martin Scorsese, expects to earn more this year than he made at his peak as a stockbroker, allowing him to repay the victims of his fraud.

Belfort, a motivational speaker, will use his earnings from a 45-city speaking tour in the US to repay about $US50 million to investors. That was his share of the fine, he said.

Belfort spent 22 months in jail for money laundering and securities fraud in the 1990s after his Long Island-based Stratton Oakmont defrauded investors out of more than $US200 million. That story was retold last year in a blockbuster film starring Leonardo DiCaprio.

The Securities and Exchange Commission shut down his firm in 1998, and in 2003 Belfort was convicted and sentenced to four years in jail. The government said a $US110.4 million victim- compensation fund must receive half his income.

Belfort acknowledges he fleeced investors, cheated on spouses, and was once so addicted to drugs that he kicked his second wife down the stairs in front of his daughter. Even after the fines, he maintains most of his trading activities were legal.

In Dubai, where Belfort spoke today, the $US100 million film that earned DiCaprio a Golden Globe award, was cut by a quarter for multiple scenes depicting drug use and sex. The f-word is used 569 times in the original version, more than any feature film ever made, according to the Internet Movie Database website.
