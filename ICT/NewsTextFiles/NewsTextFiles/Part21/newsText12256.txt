EU-trained junior doctors who are being recruited to work here as part of the latest cost-saving health service plan still cannot be compelled to sit a test by their regulatory body to prove how fluent they are in English.

The Medical Council said yesterday that under legislation, it cannot test the language skills of doctors who qualified in the EU prior to them being registered.

Until an EU directive is written into law here, it is up to employers to demonstrate the doctor's competence in English, a spokeswoman added.

Earlier, Barry O'Brien, the head of human resources in the HSE, said they would be looking to countries in eastern Europe to fill posts in hospitals for junior doctors in a bid to reduce reliance on agency medics.

It is part of its wider plan to generate â‚¬80m through a range of measures including more use of lower-paid healthcare assistants instead of nurses.

He insisted that despite claims by nursing unions about the cuts, the plan would not damage patient safety.

The medical council has long argued for the ability to impose a language test on EU-trained doctors, particularly after a high-profile case involving Romanian-trained medic Asia Ndaga (31) who was a senior house officer at Letterkenny Hospital in Donegal. It emerged she was unable to take a pulse and had difficulty communicating because of poor English.

A spokeswoman for the HSE said it was recruiting junior doctors from across the EU, not just eastern Europe, and it used a European public recruitment and career service to advertise across the EU.
