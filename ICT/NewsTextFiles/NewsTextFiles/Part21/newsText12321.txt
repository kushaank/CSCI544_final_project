West Business Solutions to reduce its Oklahoma City staff to 71.

West Business Solutions has given layoff notices to 110 call center workers at its Oklahoma City office.

About 71 workers will remain at West’s Oklahoma City offices at 1331 W Memorial Road after the layoffs, which are scheduled for June 3 and July 12, according to a letter the company sent to the Oklahoma Commerce Department.

The company has decided to reduce its Oklahoma City staff after losing a contract with a telecommunications company for inbound customer calls after a slowdown in the client’s business, West spokesman Dave Pleiss said.

West Business Solutions is part of the Omaha-based telecommunications services company West Corp. The company takes inbound customer service calls for several clients at its Oklahoma City office.

West is also consolidating some operations from Oklahoma City to another office in Appleton, Wisc., Pleiss said.

If West receives additional business contracts, there is the possibility that some of the Oklahoma City workers will not be laid off, Pliess said. The company issued the layoff notices in compliance with the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, which requires large employers to give workers at least 60 days notice before a mass layoffs in some instances.

West will offer outplacement assistance to workers who lose their jobs, as well as severance pay based in part on years of service with the company.

“West will continue trying to attract new business in its Oklahoma City office,” the company said in its letter to the Commerce Department.
