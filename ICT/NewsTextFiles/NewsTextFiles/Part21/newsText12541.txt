MIDDLETOWN, Md. (AP) - The Maryland Agriculture Department is promoting an ice cream trail stretching from western Maryland to the Eastern Shore.

Secretary Buddy Hance is joining owners of the South Mountain Creamery in Middletown on Monday to encourage people to visit all eight producers along the Maryland’s Best Ice Cream Trail.

They are farms or creameries that sell directly to consumers.

People who get their passports stamped at each location become eligible for a drawing. The top prize is a $50 gift certificate from their favorite creamery.

The other producers are Broom’s Bloom Dairy in Harford County; Chesapeake Bay Farms in Worcester County; Keyes Creamery in Harford County; Kilby Cream in Cecil County; Misty Meadows Farm Creamery in Washington County; Prigel Family Creamery in Baltimore County; and Rocky Point Creamery in Frederick County.
