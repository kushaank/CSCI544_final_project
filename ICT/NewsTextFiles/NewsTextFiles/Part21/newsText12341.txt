Yesterday we posted an  article  describing the unsettled test for independent contractor status under Colorado’s unemployment insurance benefits laws after the Colorado Court of Appeals issued a new decision last week.  Now, that test has been settled as the Colorado Supreme Court issued its decision in the Softrock andWestern Logistics cases.

Require the worker to work exclusively for the putative employer; except that the worker may choose to work exclusively for that business for a finite period of time specified in the independent contractor agreement;

Establish a quality standard for the worker; except that the putative employer can provide plans and specifications regarding the work but cannot oversee the actual work or instruct the worker as to how the work will be performed;

Pay a salary or hourly rate but rather a fixed or contract rate;

Terminate the worker during the contract period unless the worker violates the terms of the contract or fails to produce a result that meets the specifications of the contract;

Provide more than minimal training for the worker;

Provide tools or benefits to the worker; except that materials and equipment may be supplied;

Dictate the time of performance; except that a completion schedule and a range of mutually agreeable work hours may be established;

Maintains an independent business card, listing, address, or telephone;

Has a financial investment in the project or risks suffering a loss;

Uses his or her own equipment on the project;

Sets the price for performing the project;

Although we have yet to see how the courts and agencies will apply this new totality of the circumstances test, putative employer should try to satisfy as many of these factors as possible in order to establish that workers are independent contractors, not employees.  Putative employers should also continue to use independent contractor agreements that satisfy all the statutory factors needed to create a presumption that workers are independent contractors.  However, there is now no limit to the types of evidence putative employers may invoke to establish independent contractor status, and putative employers are no longer bound by the outdated rule that workers must always offer their services to others at the same time the work for the putative employer in order to be considered independent contractors.
