BOISE, Idaho, May 19, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Blaze Energy Corp. (OTC Markets: BLZE) today announced, effective April 22nd, it has closed on the acquisition of Kentucky Diversified Fuels, LLC ("KDF").  As announced in the Company's prior release of February 11, KDF is a recently consolidated energy company with operations in eastern Kentucky, consisting of a steam coal strip-mining company, Middle Fork Development Services, LLC ("MFDS"), and subsidiaries; a development stage coal-to-liquid company, MXP, LLC ("MXP"); and a coal feedstock impoundment, situated on 24.68 acres, with approximately 2.4 million tons of in-place fine refuse reserves.

MFDS operates an active coal mining operation in Magoffin County, Kentucky, with annual production in excess of 165,000 tons in FY2013 and revenues of $8.6 million, and projected coal production of 325,000 tons in FY2014, and revenues of $16.3 million.  MXP is a development stage, coal-to liquid ("CTL") company, which is seeking to utilize its technology to transform energy trapped in otherwise wasted natural resources, such as the coal fine impoundments acquired by the Company, into superior transportation fuels and fuel additives.  MXP has secured a long-term contract with Tenaska BioFuels, LLC to purchase its entire production output for distribution to the consumer marketplace.  The coal refuse reserves, known as the Dotson Fork Impoundment, is the by-product of the previous coal mining operations of Chisholm Coal Company, and contains over 1.9 million tons of recoverable coal reserves, providing an estimated 50-year feedstock for the MXP proposed plant.

The Company plans additional updates in the upcoming weeks, once the transition is fully complete and it can more definitively project operational expectations into the future.
