
The outstanding bluegrass quintet Notre Dame de Grass – arguably one of Montreal’s most underrated musical treasures – have recorded an instant classic with their second album, That’s How the Music Begins.

The exceptional playing of Matt Large (guitar), Guy Donis (banjo), Andrew Horton (bass), Joe Grass (mandolin) and Josh Zubot (fiddle) is bolstered here by strong, memorable material in an irresistible combination that we can safely call one of the year’s most satisfying releases.

The disc’s masterpiece is New Canada, a moving celebration of the country’s changing face, with a beautiful, haunting melody that evokes the risk and fears faced by the immigrants who settle here to make a new life.

The title track is an infectious, toe-tapping ode to the joys of playing these beloved sounds, while the gentle Lily Rose, the tent-revival swing of Pile It On and rich pastoral instrumental Riffle and Run are among the other tracks that keep the dynamics and pacing taut.

Although the instrumentation is defiantly traditional, this triumphant set lies somewhere beyond bluegrass. If what you love is Foggy Mountain Breakdown-style abandon, you’ll find it in the breakneck-speed virtuosity of vertiginous performances like Mount Royal Backstep and Words of My Mother – but perhaps the best way to think of this album is as a collection of great songs.

And there’s something that’s in woefully short supply these days.
