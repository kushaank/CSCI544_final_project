
THUNDER BAY - The debate is on. Kathleen Wynne has stepped up and honoured her challenge to Tim Hudak and Andrea Horwath on a Northern Leader’s Debate.

Ontario Liberal leader Kathleen Wynne has confirmed her participation in the Northern Leaders’ Debate on Monday, May 26th. The Northwestern Ontario Municipal Association (NOMA) will host the debate in Thunder Bay.

“I am pleased to hear that there will be a leader’s debate in Thunder Bay. This reaffirms the Liberal party’s commitment to Northern Ontario. We have a strong plan for the North and I am confident that this forum will clearly demonstrate our commitment and highlight what matters most to Northerners,” added Bill Mauro Liberal candidate Thunder Bay – Atikokan.

Wynne was first to call for a debate specifically focused on Northern issues and put forward a direct challenge to the PC and NDP leaders while attending NOMA’s annual conference in Fort Frances on April 24th, 2014.

The news made NDP leader Andrea Howath “Giggle” when she heard the challenge.

The Liberals say, in a statement, “Andrea Horwath’s NDP put Ontario’s economic recovery at risk when they chose not to support a budget that would have made important investments in Northern Ontario”.

“The Hudak PC proposal to slash 100,000 jobs would put Ontario’s economy at risk and plunge the province back into recession. Fewer people at work means less money invested back into the economy, leading to thousands of layoffs,” according to the Liberals.

Depending on the polls, the Liberals are either leading the election, at least according to the latest Ekos Poll, or way behind as the Ipso Reid Poll has it. The only poll that really matters will be on election day.
