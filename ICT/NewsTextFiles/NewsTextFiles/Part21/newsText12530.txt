
AT&T and DirecTV announced a deal on Sunday by which AT&T would buy the satellite TV provider in a deal that calls for DirecTV shareholders to receive $28.50 in cash and $66.50 in AT&T stock a share.

The deal would give AT&T about 26 million pay television subscribers â€” close to what Comcast would have if it completes a $45 billion purchase of Time Warner Cable .

AT&T also would add to its reach for high-speed broadband service, particularly in rural areas.

The deal may put renewed pressure on Overland Park-based Sprint Corp. and Dish Network to ally. The companies said in December that they would cooperate on a pilot program to offer fixed wireless broadband service in Corpus Christi, Texas.

The AT&T deal also may cut regulatory resistance to a Sprint purchase of T-Mobile US Inc.
