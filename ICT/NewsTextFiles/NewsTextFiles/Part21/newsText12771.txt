The town’s air show is the premier tourist event on Tendring’s calendar and the presence of the aircraft will be a major boost.

The Lancasters are operated by the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight and the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum.

The Canadian plane has recently been the subject of a $500,000 fund-raising drive to keep it in the air.

Mark Platt, Tendring District Council’s cabinet member for culture, tourism, events and leisure services, said it was a major coup for the show.

This year’s air show will be on August 21 and 22 from 11am to 5pm on both days. Visit clactonairshow.com for more details.
