
Hungary’s Media Service Support and Asset Management Fund (MTVA) has launched a HbbTV service with technical support from the national transmission company Antenna Hungária.

MTVA was formed in 2011 and brings together all the assets of the three public service media organisations (MTV, Duna TV and MR) and the National News Agency (MTI).

The HbbTV service will be available through the DTT service MinDig TV, which is operated by Antenna Hungária, and MTVA’s satellite broadcasts.

Antenna Hungária first began trialing HbbTV in October 2013.

There are currently over 160,000 HbbTV ready TVs in Hungarian homes.

Furthermore, one third of smart TVs in stores are HbbTV ready.
