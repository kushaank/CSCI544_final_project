
Dasan Machineries, a Korea-based manufacturer, announced last week that it will locate to Georgia, creating 150 jobs and investing $30 million over the next three years.

The Duluth-based facility will be the company’s first headquarters in the United States. The company will use high-precision machinery to manufacture components for the automotive and defense industries at this new location. For more than 20 years, Dasan Machineries has been a leading producer of high-quality steel parts and components for the defense, auto and avionic industries.

"We were drawn to Gwinnett County and the state of Georgia because of the pro-business environment, skilled workforce and existing infrastructure that is available in the region," said Jin Noh, president of Dasan USA. "We were further excited to learn that Duluth is the center of Georgia's Korean-American community. As a family-owned business, we place a high value on being locally involved and hope to positively contribute to the area's growth and success for years to come."

Georgia has had continuous representation in Korea since 1985. Currently, there are more than 60 Korean facilities that operate in the state. Bill Dobbs, director of the ADAM (aerospace, defense, advanced manufacturing) team at the Georgia Department of Economic Development (GDEcD), partnered with the Gwinnett Chamber Economic Development to assist the company on behalf of the state.
