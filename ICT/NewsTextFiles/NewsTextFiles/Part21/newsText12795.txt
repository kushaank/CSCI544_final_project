
Mammoliti has long been a critic of all-ages raves.

“The same promoter (of the Avicii concert) wants to bring 8,000 to Exhibition Place for raves,” Mammoliti said, adding such events have to be stopped.

Toronto EMS were called to the Rogers Centre because the private paramedics hired to cover the event were overwhelmed by the number of people who needed to be hospitalized.

“At the next meeting of city council I will be requesting a report from staff on the cost of emergency services and hospital ward beds related to this event,” Mammoliti said.

He estimated the cost of dealing with those who fell ill at the show — for an overnight stay at an emergency ward, plus the tab for EMS care — is be more than $100,000.

He argued it’s irresponsible to allow children to attend all ages-events, Mammoliti said.
