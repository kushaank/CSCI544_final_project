
The Honourable Shelly Glover, Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages, today announced funding of $9,000,000 over two years for the Society for Educational Visits and Exchanges in Canada (SEVEC).

The Government of Canada has provided this funding through the Exchanges Canada program to enable youth from across Canada to participate in reciprocal exchanges organised by SEVEC.

Over the next two years, approximately 9,000 youth will take part in 10-day reciprocal exchanges across the country.

Groups of 12- to 17-year-olds are twinned based on age and interests and spend five days in each other's community.

During the educational exchanges, young Canadians learn about a different community and our official languages, as well as Canadian history and heritage.

"Young people deserve opportunities that help them connect with others, exchange ideas, and explore their potential while experiencing our country and learning about its history. We are pleased to invest in the future leaders of this great country."

"On behalf of the 4,500 young people, chaperones and families from all parts of Canada who experience SEVEC youth exchanges each year, we applaud today's announcement and the Government's ongoing investment in our youth. SEVEC youth exchanges bring classroom history books to life as youth travel and explore Canada's proud and diverse history honouring our generations past and present."
