
Agreement between ports of Puerto Bolivar and Port Hueneme in California allows banana producers to have more direct approach.

The Port Authority of Puerto Bol√≠var signed an agreement with Port Hueneme, in California, United States, in the city of Machala on Friday [May 16] with the aim of sharing knowledge on logistics distribution channels and on security.

This agreement was made through the coordination of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and the Institute for the Promotion of Exports and Investments PRO ECUADOR, via its sales office in Los Angeles.

The cooperation agreement's primary objective is the exchange and transfer of knowledge, staff training on topics such as technical cooperation, participation in business forums and workshops between the two ports.

Nearly 30 million boxes of bananas, with an estimated market value of $885 million dollars, are imported via Port Hueneme every year. This agreement will provide better facilities to the exporters of Ecuadorian bananas.

"These approaches demonstrate the willingness of the Ecuadorian government to maintain and strengthen its trading relationship with the United States," said Dick Vega, manager of PRO ECUADOR's Trade Office in Los Angeles.

U.S. port authorities will attend to the signing of the agreement, and they will meet with producers, exporters and associations related to the marketing of bananas.
