
AMMONNEWS - The Jordanian government is negotiating to supply Israel with natural gas to substitute the Egyptian gas for the same price; Jordan Al-Ghad newspaper said on Monday quoting an unnamed government official , Middle East Monitor reported.

The source said the Jordanian government offered to sell natural gas to Israel at $4.5 per million BTUs.

The source pointed out that the "talks between the parties also discussed exporting gas to Egypt via Israel through the Arab gas pipeline to help Egypt fulfil its dire need of gas".

The source also noted that Egypt suffers a shortage of gas, especially after the January revolution when the exploration and extraction of new quantities of natural gas had stopped.

In 2012 Egypt cancelled an agreement signed in 2005 to provide Israel with nearly 1.7 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually for 20 years at a price ranging between 70 cents to 1.5 USD per million BTUs.

The Arab Potash Company and Jordan Bromine Company signed an agreement with the U.S. Noble Energy, last February, to supply it with two billion cubic meters of natural gas from the Tamar field, off the coast of Israel for a period of 15 years and at a value of $771 million.

You have that backwards. Israel has 30 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, Jordan has zero. It is Israel that will sell gas to Jordan. The Arab Potash Company did not signed an agreement with US noble Energy. Nobel Energy is a minority shareholder in the Israel Tamar gas field. They singed an agreement to the consortium of Israeli and American companies that are licensed by the Israeli government to run the Tamar field. The agreement was approved by the Israeli government.

I thought Tamar gas field belongs to Israel and partner Noble a Energy of the USA.
