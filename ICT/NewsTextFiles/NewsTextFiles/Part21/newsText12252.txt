Ray Martin, a regular on television screens since the 1960s will be at Grafton Base Hospital this morning and the Bulgarr Ngaru Medical Aboriginal Corporation this afternoon to inspect almost $100,000 worth of equipment the foundation has donated to the hospital.

Mr Martin will join foundation chairman Paul Francis for the visit.

Mr Francis said visits like this allow the foundation to check up on how their money is being spent and also to publicise the work of its Good Eggs, who have raised $40million for 214 hospitals across the nation.

"To date, the Humpty Dumpty Foundation supporters from across Australia have generously provided $98,000 worth of medical equipment to the Grafton Base Hospital, including an infant resuscitation cot, a jaundice measure and a sure signs VM8 bedside monitor," Mr Francis said.
