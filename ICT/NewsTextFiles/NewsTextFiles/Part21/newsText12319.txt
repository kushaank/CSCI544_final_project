FLINT, MI -- A vice president of American SpiralWeld Pipe Co. says the company is still looking to hire employees for a new manufacturing plant here.

Patrick Hook, vice president of operations for American, said the company is looking for skilled workers, particularly in the areas of welding, machine operations and maintenance.

Hourly jobs typically pay a starting wage of $17 to $22 an hour , company officials have said, and hiring is being coordinated by  Genesee/Shiawassee Michigan Works!

American is manufacturing steel pipe for the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline from Lake Huron to Flint, and Hook said that work has started at the factory site, located on East Marengo Avenue at the old Buick City complex.

Documents filed with the city say the development represents a $14.2 million investment and 40 to 50 jobs.

Hook said the company's pre-engineered, metal-sided, 180,000-square-foot manufacturing plant has been ordered and contractors are expected to start working on the site this week.

"We've started to make a few hires," the vice president said. "We're using Michigan Works to help with the hiring process."
