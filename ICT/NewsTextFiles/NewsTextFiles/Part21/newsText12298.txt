The company said today's cases saw a total of €7.8m debt brought to the bankruptcy court. €6.7m (85%) of this was mortgage debt and €1.1m (15%) was unsecured debt.

"All of our clients have been under tremendous stress and this is the end of the debt road for them. They can put the stress and the health issues which come with debt behind them. This is not only good for the debtors but it is good for society as a whole," commented Jane Carroll, from Neo Financial Solutions.
