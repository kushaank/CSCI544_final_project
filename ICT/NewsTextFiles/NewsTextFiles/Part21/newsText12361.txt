
The latest accessory of choice and a "must-have" item that has emerged amongst wealthy Chinese for decorating their homes, offices and clubs is none-other than the cuddly, lovable and endangered polar bear. Stuffed.

Sales of legally imported mounted specimens of polar bears and other animals are booming in a Beijing exhibition hall, reported Beijing Youth Daily.

“Business is going well,” a saleswoman at the hall, outside of the capital’s northern Fifth Ring Road, told the newspaper.

“One company boss came and bought a 3.3-meter-tall stuffed polar bear for 600,000 yuan (US$96,238) without any bargaining,” she added.

For those who can't actually afford a polar bear (or probably fit one in their house), all other things fuzzy and sourced from a blisteringly cold destination will do, with a stuffed arctic fox fetching a humble 80,000 yuan.

Other furry friends such as elk and lions are also high in demand as well as the heads of elephants, deer and zebras.

But don't worry. “The animals for sale died of natural causes,” the saleswoman said.

Because with the world's impeccable record with "exotic" animals and the absolute non-existence of animal poaching in history, we can be sure that with statements such as “Prices reflect their endangered status” (as uttered by the saleswoman) will under no circumstance trigger a spike in the black market.

In hindsight, the lavender bears seem like a much friendlier alternative status symbol.
