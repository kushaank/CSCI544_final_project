The man who blew the whistle on the John Banks donation saga is set to give evidence in the Auckland High Court this afternoon.

Kim Dotcom is expected to tell the court how much the former ACT Party leader knew about two $25,000 donations he declared as anonymous following his failed 2010 mayoral campaign.

Originally Dotcom's former bodyguard Wayne Tempero was scheduled to testify ahead of Dotcom, but the order was revised this morning to allow the millionaire to complete his full testimony today.

Earlier this morning, the woman who presided over Banks' ill-fated campaign, Michelle Boag, told the court Dotcom's name was never mentioned to her by anyone on the team â€“ including Banks.

"I never knew who Kim Dotcom was until he was arrested."

Ms Boag said she became aware of a $15,000 donation made by SkyCity after the financial return was filed.

She said she has known Banks since 1978 when he first ran for the National Party.

"I wouldn't call us close friends but yes he's been a friend for most of that time."

Ms Boag painted a picture of Banks as a kind-hearted man, always willing to help her with various charity campaigns.

"[He is] very direct, very forthright and he's one of the most generous people I have ever met in my life."

She denied having any responsibility in the finances, but was the main person responsible for initiating donation campaigns.

The morning began with a continued cross-examination of Lance Hutchison, the campaign's finance manager.

The Local Electorate Act makes it illegal for donations to be listed as anonymous if the candidate knew who made them. Mr Hutchison yesterday stated while Banks may have known about a donation from Sky City, the donation could be listed as anonymous because he would not have known the amount.
