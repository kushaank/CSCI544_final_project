
Greenbrier's Bill Furman said the Dallas-area hub will likely hire more workers on top of the initial eight employees who'll open the facility.

Greenbrier Cos. has opened a regional hub in the Dallas area.

Greenbrier (NYSE: GBX) procured some 6,000 square feet of space in Colleyville, Texas. The company says the hub â€œpositions Greenbrier closer to the bulk of its customer base and North American operations, as well as the important Gulf Coast and Midwest energy and downstream markets.

Eight employees will initially staff the facility, with more hiring expected to take place. The hub will focus on product development, engineering and retrofit design for tank cars.

â€œOur Dallas-Fort Worth hub positions Greenbrier at the center of the burgeoning energy markets that we expect will be a major driver of our business for years to come,â€� said Bill Furman , Greenbrierâ€™s chairman and CEO, in a release.

The location further offers Greenbrier easier access to the energy, petrochemical and plastics markets.

The company already employs nearly 500 people in the Gulf Coast region.
