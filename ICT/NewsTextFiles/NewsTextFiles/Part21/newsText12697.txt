
A 19-YEAR-OLD pupil of Hillcrest Secondary School in Livingstone has been sentenced to nine months imprisonment with hard labour by the Livingstone Magistrate’s Court for possession of property believed to have been stolen or unlawfully obtained.

Resident magistrate Chinkashi Chilingala last Friday convicted and jailed Justine Kabali of house number 792 DSV Extension after finding him guilty of possession of property believed to have been stolen or unlawfully obtained.

In mitigation, Kabali said he is a pupil at Hillcrest Secondary School and that he suffers from abdominal pains.

“I am a pupil at Hillcrest Secondary School and my future will be ruined if I am sent to prison, I also have abdominal pains. I am asking for leniency from the court,” Kabali said.

But Mr Chilingala dismissed Kabali’s mitigation of suffering from abdominal pains.

“The offence you committed is very serious, so I am sending you to prison for nine months with hard labour so that you can reflect,” Mr Chilingala said.

It is alleged that Kabali, on May 8 this year in Livingstone,   had in his possession an HP laptop computer,  Del laptop computer and a black bag which were believed to have been stolen or unlawfully obtained.

And in another case before the same court, a 38-year-old man from Botswana was sentenced to one year imprisonment with hard labour for stealing two pairs of slippers from Pep Stores.

This is in a case in which Romeo Khumalo was charged with theft.

In mitigation, Khumalo said he stole the two pairs of slippers because he wanted to sell them to raise transport money to return to Botswana after his belongings were stolen from a refugee camp.
