
In order to alleviate energy dependence on Moscow, the coup-imposed government in Kiev has resurrected a contract with a US company to supply fuel to Ukraineâ€™s nuclear power plants. Using US fuel rods was banned in 2012 due to dangerous incompatibility.

The rivalry for nuclear fuel supply to Ukraine between Russiaâ€™s   nuclear fuel cycle company TVEL and Americaâ€™s Westinghouse took a   twist when in April 2014, shortly after the armed coup, Kiev   signed a new deal with Americaâ€™s leading nuclear fuel producer,   Westinghouse Electric Company, instead of the Russian TVEL   company that has been supplying fuel rods to Ukraine for years.

Ukraineâ€™s 4 nuclear power plants constitute a huge part of the   country's energy system. The countryâ€™s 15 nuclear reactors   produce at least 50 percent (over 13 megawatt) of all electric   power generation in Ukraine. All nuclear fuel for Ukrainian   reactors (worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year) has been   produced in Russia, which also recycles Ukraineâ€™s nuclear waste.

Moreover, Russiaâ€™s Rosatom state-owned nuclear monopoly is   currently constructing a nuclear fuel fabrication plant in   Ukraine, where nuclear fuel rods will be assembled using uranium   enriched in Russia.

All in all, Ukraine has relied on Russia in all atomic matters â€“   but the West has muscled in on the relationship.

The Westinghouse Electric Company has been trying to â€˜easeâ€™ the former Soviet-bloc countries energy reliance   on Russia and enter the market in Eastern Europe for over a   decade. For that purpose the company was also using political   leverage. Back in 2012, the then US Secretary of State Hillary   Clinton attempted to convince Czech leaders to pick up Americaâ€™s   Westinghouse as a primary nuclear fuel supply partner instead of   Russia, which would create thousands of new jobs in the US.

Actually, Westinghouse has already supplied nuclear fuel to   Ukraineâ€™s Energoatom nuclear power generator company. In 2005,   six experimental Westinghouse fuel assemblies, adopted for use in   USSR-developed reactors, were tried at the South Ukraine plant in   one reactor together with Russian fuel rods.

Though nuclear engineers were skeptical of the pilot probe, the   government of former president Viktor Yushchenko signed a deal in   2008 with Westinghouse on fuel rod supply, despite the fact that   American nuclear fuel is significantly more expensive and   technologically different: Russian nuclear fuel rods are   hexagonal in section, while Americans produce fuel assemblies of   square section.

This time a batch of 42 fuel assemblies was loaded into three   reactors at the South Ukraine nuclear power plant for a standard   three-year period of commercial operation.

When in 2012 the time came to replace the fuel assemblies,   Ukrainian nuclear engineers found that Westinghouse assemblies   deformed during exploitation and got stuck in the core.

Energoatom accused Westinghouse of producing poorly engineered   assemblies, whereas Westinghouse countered, accusing the   Ukrainian engineers of installing the rods badly.

After the incident the use of American nuclear fuel was banned in   Ukraine fuel rods were returned to the producer â€˜to get   fixedâ€™ and Russian experts were summoned to help with the   repair of the equipment produced in the USSR. The Energoatom   Company lost an estimated $175 million.

Similar problems with Westinghouse fuel assemblies occurred at a   number of other USSR-constructed nuclear power plants: NPP KrÅ¡ko   in Slovenia, NPP Loviisa in Finland and NPP Temelin in the Czech   Republic. All these countries opted to return to time-proved fuel   assemblies produced by Russiaâ€™s TVEL Company.

Now Ukraine appears to be ready to fall into the same trap twice.   The coup-imposed Kiev regime has renewed the 2008 nuclear fuel   deal till 2020, to replace 25 percent of the Russian-made fuel   rods with an option to â€œprovide more if needed,â€� reported the Associated Press in April - all this for the sole   purpose of â€˜diversifyingâ€™ supply.

Kiev's interim authorities may be not familiar with nuclear   energy technologies, but they surely have a clue about   the consequences of a Chernobyl-like tragedy.

What happened back in 2012 at Zaporozhskaya NPP could have   potentially ended with another Chernobyl, because having   unextractable fuel assemblies loaded means a potential loss of   control over the fission processes inside the reactor.

But the new Kiev authorities, supported by Washington, are making   every effort to cut Ukraineâ€™s economic ties with Russia, so   crossing over from Russian nuclear fuel to American sounds   attractive to Arseny Yatsenyukâ€™s government despite the 2012   incident.

Furthermore, Westinghouse wonâ€™t recycle its fuel rods when they â€˜burn outâ€™, so Ukraine will be spending even more budget   money to prepare special storage facilities for nuclear waste.   Also, the company may have its sights set on a much-hotter prize.

â€œThis move by Westinghouse is really to secure not just a   fuel contract, which will go on for many years, but to put its   foot in the door to build a fuel fabrication plant in eastern   Ukraine. And thatâ€™s whatâ€™s most important and thatâ€™s what theyâ€™re   after,â€� John Large, an independent nuclear analyst from   London, told RT.

Experts generally agree that nuclear power plants are   constructions that should not undergo drastic transitions.

â€œA nuclear reactor demands a coherent structure of   operations. The active reactor core is the most dangerous when it   comes to the impact it may have on people and the environment.   All reactors differ in smallest details, and toying around with   them leads to no good,â€� Evgeny Akimov of the International   Union of Nuclear Energy Veterans told RT.

And if something goes wrong, Kiev may find that they are lonely   in facing the consequences.

â€œAs far as I know, Westinghouse signs contracts in which the   company bears no responsibility, so the burden will lie with   Ukraine,â€� said Rafael Arutyunyan, a nuclear security expert   and professor at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.

With Chernobyl and Fukushima being the prime examples, nuclear   power is a force to be handled with great care. Yet, Kievâ€™s   actions seem to be dictated by politics rather than risks, even   when the consequences may affect not just Ukraine, but the entire   European continent.

When the Chernobyl tragedy occurred back in 1986, it was a pure   coincidence that Ukraineâ€™s wind direction, usually directed into   Europe, changed, sending radioactive fallout in the direction of   Russia and Belarus.

In this over-politicized case, European capitals would do well to   learn how the wind blows beforehand.

Since when was diversifying your suppliers a bad thing? Also, conspicuously no mention here that Chernobyl disaster was a result of those crappy Soviet reactor designs.
