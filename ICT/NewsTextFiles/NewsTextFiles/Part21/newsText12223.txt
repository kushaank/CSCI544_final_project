
The city of Albuquerque is poised to give $1.9 million to the new ABQid business accelerator program, Mayor Richard Berry said during a keynote speech at a NAIOP luncheon Monday.

The money will come from the cityâ€™s Economic Development Action Account, which is the fund the city set up with money from clawbacks from Schott Solarâ€™s shutdown. It will help the new accelerator, which is based on the Techstars model, with programmatic needs.

â€œNow weâ€™re taking what was a bet on one company, and weâ€™ll turn it into a bet on 30 to 40 companies,â€� said Bill Bice in response to the announcement. Bice is a Verge Fund partner who is on the board of directors of ABQid.

ABQid is a new venture designed to help entrepreneurs in Albuquerque cope with the initial needs of a startup. Entrepreneurs receive a $20,000 stipend, for example, so they can quit their day jobs and focus on their companies. They attend an intensive 90-day training that focuses on developing and testing their products. In exchange for the stipend and the training, companies give ABQid a six percent equity position.

â€œTake an idea, and run it through the business model canvas. What itâ€™s really about is the assumptions youâ€™re making about your business,â€� Bice said.

Bice said that entrepreneurs often find their assumptions are wrong in the process.
