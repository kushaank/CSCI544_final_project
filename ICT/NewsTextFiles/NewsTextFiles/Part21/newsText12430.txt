
Shares of Rackspace (NYSE: RAX ) are up 36 percent in the past five trading sessions as the company reported strong  first quarter earnings and Wall Street has been passing around rumors that the company may be acquired .

Shares shot higher last Thursday as the company disclosed in an 8-K that it had hired Morgan Stanley to help it explore the potential sale.

The competition Milunovich refers to include companies with data hosting businesses such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, IBM and Hewlett-Packard. These companies all have significantly more resources and a wider product offering than Rackspace, enabling faster development and cross selling.

Companies such as Dell and HP do not have the resources to buy Rackspace, which currently has a $5 billion market cap, according to the UBS note. Telecom companies are also unlikely to jump into the industry. The note goes on to say that Cisco, EMC and VMWare are all likely acquirers of the company.

UBS currently has a Neutral rating on Rackspace with a $34 price target. Shares are trading at $35.76 in Monday afternoon's session.
