
COPPER futures closed at their highest level in two months as worries about supply helped lift prices of the industrial metal.

The most actively traded contract, for July delivery, rose two cents, or 0.6 per cent, to settle at $US3.167 a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Copper prices have been recovering, after sliding to four year lows in March, as worries about an economic slowdown in China appeared to be overdone.

China is the world's largest copper consumer, accounting for about 40 per cent of global demand.

While some investors feared that slower business activity would dent the country's copper purchases, recent economic data led traders to grow more optimistic in their outlook on copper demand.

Copper has also drawn support from concerns about a short-term shortfall in supply.

Most industry analysts expect copper mine production to exceed demand in 2014, leading to the first supply surplus of the metal since 2009. But in recent months, global inventories of copper have been in decline.

Copper stored in the London Metal Exchange's global warehousing network, the world's largest metals storage network, are at their lowest level since September 2008.

Meanwhile, nickel futures posted their biggest one-day gain since September 2012.

Nickel prices rebounded as investors refocused on Indonesia, the world's largest nickel producer, which in January banned the export of unprocessed nickel ore.

Nickel for three month delivery closed kerb trading up 5.7 per cent at $US20,100 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange.

This was the highest one day gain in 20 months.
