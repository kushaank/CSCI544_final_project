
MONSEY -  A Monsey family is suing a popular Orthodox Jewish summer camp in Pennsylvania, claiming the camp tried to cover up that a counselor molested their son.

The father says his 12-year-old son suffered at Camp Dora Golding and is not doing well now. He claims the 20-year-old Canadian counselor, Chisdau Ben Porath, touched his son inappropriately at the camp last summer. The civil suit claims the camp tried to cover the whole thing up.

Porath pleaded guilty in February to molesting the boy and was sentenced to between 5 and 23 months in county jail. The family's attorney, Brian Condon, says the camp's background checks for counselors are not good enough and Porath should never have been around children.
