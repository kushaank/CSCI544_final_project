
Bob Rivers, president of Eastern Bank, the largest Massachusetts-based bank, gave $500 to the Grossman campaign.

Since the beginning of the year, more Massachusetts bank CEOs have donated to Republican Charlie Bakerâ€™s campaign for governor than either of the other top candidates.

Baker has drawn donations from six bank and credit union CEOs, while state Treasurer Steven Grossman , a Democrat, has attracted money from four top bank executives.

Attorney General Martha Coakley was a key player in the $25 billion national mortgage settlement with big banks in 2012, and sheâ€™s made taking banks to task a key part of her campaign. Three bank CEOs have contributed to her campaign since the beginning of the year.

Coakley, Baker and Steven Grossman had war chests stocked with a combined $2.3 million as of April 30, according to the state Office of Campaign and Political Finance.

With a balance of $938,975, Grossman has the most cash. Grossmanâ€™s balance is followed by Bakerâ€™s $854,809 and Coakleyâ€™s $519,621.
