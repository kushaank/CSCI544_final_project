
Sangrur: Confrontation over wages during paddy sowing and leasing of land to dalits turned ugly at Baopur village of Sangrur district on Monday, with landlords stopping water supply to home of dalits and also announcing a boycott of those employing them for work in fields. They have decided to slap a fine of Rs 21,000 on any landlord who employs a dalit.

The dalits have now approached the district administration for help.

"The village landlords have refused us access to fields, village pond and water tank," said Guru Ravidas society secretary Raj Kumar and Mahavir Singh. They said landlords wanted the shamlat land meant for lower class families but "we wanted this 27 acre land to be leased for not more than Rs 10,000 a year so that we could make use of this land".

Village sarpanch Lehri Singh said some landlords had a tiff with dalits "and efforts are being diffuse the situation". However, he denied any boycott call.

Sangrur additional deputy commissioner Pritam Singh Johal said, "We are investigating and if complaint is found to be true action will be taken."

Village  Adi Dharam Samaj activists have threatened to start struggle if boycott was not lifted soon.
