For the last decade sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have steadily risen in all age groups across Canada. And no one can explain why.

Chlamydia and gonorrhea are the two most common STIs and have continued to rise annually for more than 10 years, according to the B.C. Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).

Dr. Mark Gilbert of the BCCDC has been hunting for the truth on this trend but has yet to find it.

According to the BCCDC 2012 annual report on STIs (the latest available data), the number of reported cases of genital gonorrhea in B.C. in 2003 was 172 for females and 481 for males.

In 2012 the numbers had gone up to 449 for females and 843 for males.

The same rising trend is true for chlamydia, Gilbert said.

At this point he can only speculate – perhaps it’s changes in their testing patterns, or people knowing more about their problem and seeking help sooner, or maybe it’s a change in sexual behaviours. The only thing he knows for sure is that he doesn’t know.

Gilbert isn’t alone either, as the PHAC has found the same trend in their own data and dates the continued rise in chlamydia, gonorrhea and infectious syphilis starting back in 1997.

The PHAC said they’re working closely with provincial and territorial partners to develop and disseminate tools to keep an eye on STIs and find new ways to combat the infections.

But Gilbert believes to help stop the trend it has to start with the people.

“I think the key message is always that STIs can happen any any age, so really, if you’re sexually active it’s always a good idea to talk to a doctor about getting a test,” he said.
