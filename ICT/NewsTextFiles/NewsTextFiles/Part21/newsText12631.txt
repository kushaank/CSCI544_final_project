
The DSN program provides radio communications and tracking for all of        NASA's interplanetary spacecraft; it is used for radio astronomy and        radar observations of the solar system and the universe. Exelis has        provided the critical networks and systems maintenance, operations and        engineering services needed to support NASA’s important missions over        the past decade, including the Mars Curiosity rover and the Cassini        mission to Saturn.

As a global provider of critical network solutions, Exelis has supported NASA and the Jet        Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) on the DSN program since 2003. Exelis        provides technologies and support needed to operate and maintain DSN        facilities globally, including sites in Goldstone, California; Madrid,        Spain; and Canberra, Australia. Through its support of major facility        and communications infrastructures at DSN sites around the world, Exelis        has helped transform the way critical data, images and scientific        information from interplanetary and Earth-orbiting missions are        accessed. The DSN has revolutionized spacecraft tracking and        communication.

Exelis will showcase a full range of critical networks solutions and        intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and analytics during the 30th Space Symposium at The Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs, Colorado,        May 19-22. Space Symposium is organized by the Space        Foundation , an advocacy group dedicated to advancing space-related        endeavors to inspire, enable and propel humanity.
