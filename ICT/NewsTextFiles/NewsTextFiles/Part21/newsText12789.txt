
Near Grindstone Provincial Park: There's still plenty of ice on parts of Lake Winnipeg, so much so that two canoeists were temporarily stranded Sunday before being rescued by the Canadian Coast Guard.

A pair of stranded canoeist were saved by RCMP and Canadian Coast Guard officials Sunday in Grindstone Provincial Park.

RCMP enlisted the help of the Canadian Coast Guard to rescue the stranded canoeists.

The 19-year-old and 22-year-old canoeists set out on the waters at Grindstone Provincial Park at 12:30 p.m.

Once on the water, windy conditions and chunks of floating ice on Lake Winnipeg blocked the pair from getting back to shore.

RCMP were called to investigate around 4:30 p.m. when the men were reported missing, enlisting the help of the Canadian Coast Guard.

The canoeists were missing for about two hours when the coast guard arrived, manoeuvring through the ice and rescuing the two men.

Cam Hurst with Manitoba Conservation said boaters should take a look at where the ice is before heading out.

"People have to make that informed decision,” said Hurst. "I mean, I don't know how much ice was there when they were out there, but you know you have to take precautions."

The men were not injured.
