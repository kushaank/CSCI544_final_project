
According to information received by DR News, the Løkke Rasmussen expenses case is to be addressed tomorrow evening at a Liberal Party Executive Committee meeting.

The Liberal Party Executive Committee meeting has been moved forward to this Tuesday due to the questions surrounding party chairman Lars Løkke Rasmussen’s alleged purchase of clothes and family holidays on Mallorca for party expenses.

The meeting was otherwise scheduled for 27 May, but according to information received by DR News, is   now to be held on Tuesday evening. It has not yet been decided where the meeting is to take place.

Over the past few days, a growing number of voices from within the party, including Birthe Rønn Hornbech (Lib), the former Minister for Integration, have openly criticised Løkke Rasmussen’s actions.

A number of minor party members have also left the party in protest.

Yesterday, Liberal Party sources revealed to the Ritzau news agency that Rasmussen himself asked for the meeting to be moved forward.

As a result of the Rasmussen allegations, many party members have demanded that the party should have clear guidelines on how the Liberal Party can use its money. However, party secretary, Claus Richter has stated that the rules have already been amended.
