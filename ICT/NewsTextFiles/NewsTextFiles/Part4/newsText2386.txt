
Hutchison Drei Austria (3 Austria) only expects 1-2 new carriers to launch services on its network in 2014. In an interview with Reuters, 3 Austria CEO Jan Trionow said that new MVNOs would probably launch on its network in second-half 2014, adding that it will not be a 'huge wave'. 3 Austria was forced to offer wholesale network access to up to 16 carriers as a condition of approval for its takeover of Orange Austria. 3 Austria has signed MVNO agreements with cable operator UPC Austria and televoting company Mass Response. Trionow added that his company was still negotiating with others.
