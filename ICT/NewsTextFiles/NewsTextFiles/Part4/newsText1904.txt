
Yesterday, Prince Harry attended the Expo 2015 presentation at the MAXXI National Museum of Contemporary Arts in Italy’s capital. Harry attended the ceremony to present the UK pavilion for next year’s world fair Expo 2015 and unveiled the winning entry by artist Wolfgang Buttress.

The Expo, which will feature around 60 pavilions, was built by over 140 participant countries around the main exhibition theme of nutrition and will be held in Italy’s financial capital of Milan.

Thousands of events and cultural activities will also take place at the site of Expo 2015, which will run for six months from May to November 2015. Some estimates suggest the event could generate around €10 billion. The exhibition takes place just once every five years.

When speaking at the museum, Harry said: “The themes of the expo; sustainability and development are ones which are close to my heart, as I, like many of you here today feel hugely responsible for the next generation”.

The Prince added: “2015 is an important year for Italy as host of the world Expo, but it is also the year when progress against the Millennium Development Goals will be reviewed and a new global development agenda to end hunger and poverty will be set”.
