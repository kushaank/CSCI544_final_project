
Bones belonging to a new unnamed species of Titanosaur have been unearthed in Argentina. According to The Telegraph , a Titanosaur is "a huge herbivore of the long-necked sauropod group that lived in the Late Cretaceous period."

"Given the size of these bones, which surpass any of the previously known giant animals, the new dinosaur is the largest animal known to have walked on Earth," The Telegraph quotes a team of researchers from Argentina's Museum of Palaeontology, headed by Dr Jose Luis Carballido and Dr Diego Pol.

The Argentinian researchers add, "Its length, from its head to the tip of its tail, was 40 meters. Standing with its neck up, it was about 20 meters high - equal to a seven-storey building."

The estimated weight of the dinosaur is 70 to 80 tons, a weight equivalent to 14 grown elephants. The researchers initially estimated the unnamed dinosaur's weight to be 100 tons but later changed it.

The Guardian notes that the fossil is estimated to be 90 million years old based on the rocks around it. The bones are of a new unnamed Titanosaur species which researchers believe could be the biggest dinosaur to date.

However, a dinosaur expert opined that labeling the new dinosaur fossil discovery as the biggest and largest of its kind might not be very wise, reports The Telegraph. Dr Paul Barrett, a dinosaur expert from London's Natural History Museum told the outlet that though the unearthed dinosaur bones belong to "a genuinely big critter," more research is needed to establish the proclaimed "largest dinosaur" title.
