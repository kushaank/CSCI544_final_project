
The inquiry into Labor's disastrous home  insulation program is expected to wind up its Brisbane hearings on  Monday.

There are just four more witnesses scheduled to give evidence  about the program, which has been linked to the deaths of four  installers and hundreds of house fires.

The $20 million royal commission has heard much about time  pressures on bureaucrats to roll out the economic stimulus scheme  in the wake of the global financial crisis.

The inquiry has also heard of the program's serious design  flaws, the limited training for those working under it, and how it  was rorted because there was no way the government could check  whether a home had been insulated.

Monday's witnesses include Master Electricians Australia chief  executive Malcolm Richards, who has said his organisation wasn't  consulted on the scheme.

It's also expected to hear again from the deputy director  general of WA's Department of Premier David Smith.

Mr Smith has already told the inquiry the Rudd government knew,  before the program was rolled out, that monitoring safety would  prove difficult.

He has said the federal government was warned the states and  territories didn't have the regulatory framework to cope with the  volume of insulation installations that would be driven by the  program.

'Our existing regulatory regime (in WA) ... was not designed to  deal with a program the scale of the HIP,' he told the inquiry  earlier this month.

'It was an early and consistent message that was provided to me  and conveyed to the Commonwealth.'

Matthew Fuller, Rueben Barnes, Mitchell Sweeney and Marcus  Wilson lost their lives installing insulation under the program.

Last week, former prime minister Kevin Rudd told the inquiry he  accepted ultimate responsibility for the program's failings, but  has used secret cabinet documents to deflect blame onto his  ministers and public servants.
