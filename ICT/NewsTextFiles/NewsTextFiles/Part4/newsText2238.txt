The National Rural Health Alliance Inc (NRHA) says the $7 GP co-payment announced in the federal budget would have particularly severe consequences for people in rural and remote areas.

The NRHA also said that rural people already postpone or avoid medical consultation at higher rates than people in the cities.

This is the case for 17 per cent of people living in major cities but also for 20 per cent of those in regional areas and almost 35 per cent of those in remote areas.

It estimates if the budget decision relating to GP co-payments was to be implemented evenly across the board, the average out-of-pocket cost per service for seeing a GP would almost double in all geographic areas.

This would be after allowing for the impact of the consultation rule and the new safety net.

The Rural Doctors Association of Australia (RDAA) CEO Jenny Johnson said, while the organisation was pleased rural health had been spared substantial funding cuts within a wider healthcare budget of dramatic cost-cutting, the introduction of the $7 co-payment for GP consults was a serious concern to rural patients and doctors.

Mrs Johnson said, while it was too early to make assumptions relating exactly to the Orana region, rural areas as a whole have the right to express their concern.

"We shouldn't be looking at policies which will restrict residents in rural and remote areas further to medical access," she said.

"The last thing we want to see is rural doctors and rural patients being used as collateral damage."
