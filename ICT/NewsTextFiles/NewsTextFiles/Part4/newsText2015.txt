
MANILA, Philippines - Unidentified gunmen shot dead a government prosecutor and wounded his driver in Marawi City yesterday.

Police said Zaipal Alawi Sr., 64, assistant city prosecutor, and his driver Saiben Baiza, 46, were on their way home when two gunmen opened fire at their car in Sarimanok, Barangay Marawi shortly before noon.

Alawi reportedly died on the spot while Baiza was rushed to the Amai Pakpak Medical Center with multiple gunshot wounds.

Initial reports said the gunmen apparently waited at the scene and opened fire with their automatic handguns upon seeing the victims’ car.

It was learned from the victims’ relatives that Alawi has been receiving death threats the past few days. It was not known, however, if Alawi was handling highly sensitive cases.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) condemned the killing of Alawi.
