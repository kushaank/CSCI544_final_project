
Mbombela - A rhino poaching case against three former SA National Parks (SANParks) employees and two traffic officials could not be heard on Monday because one of the defence lawyers was unavailable.

Magistrate Andre Geldenhuys said defence lawyer Erwin Sithole was attending another matter in the High Court in Pretoria.

Ngwenyama, Mnisi, and the two Mabundas were arrested in February  2012 following the discovery of two white rhino carcasses in the Pretoriuskop section of the Kruger National Park.

after she was suspected of having transported a rhino horn out of the park.

The accused have not been asked to plead to charges of rhino poaching and are out on R20 000 bail each.

Geldenhuys postponed the trial to October 16 and 17.
