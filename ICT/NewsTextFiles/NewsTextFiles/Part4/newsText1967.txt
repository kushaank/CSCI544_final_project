
The worst floods in the region for more than half a century kill 44 people and force tens of thousands from their homes.

International rescue teams are battling against thousands of landslides as they try to reach victims of the unprecedented flooding in the Balkans.

The disaster has also prompted a warning that survivors could be at risk from landmines left over from the war in the 90s, which may have been dislodged by the water, which has also washed away the warning signs.

At least 44 people have lost their lives in the disaster across Bosnia and Serbia, with the death tolls expected to rise. Twenty of the confirmed deaths in Bosnia occurred in Doboj, while in Serbia some 16 bodies were found.

Around 3,000 landslides have been reported across the region blocking roads and damaging homes, as 10,000 people have been evacuated from the worst affected areas of north Bosnia.

Thousands of people have fled from the submerged Serbian town of Obrenovac. One of the evacuees, 40-year-old father Dragan Todorovic, said: "I carried my kids out on my back, then waited 12 hours to be rescued myself.

"The house was new, built two years ago for 100,000 euros. What now?"

The police are really worried about looting and trying to protect those thousands of empty homes.

Some 20,000 people living in Obrenovac have all left because it is too dangerous to remain and the death toll will rise in the coming days as the true extent of the disaster becomes apparent.

Rescue teams have been working hard to make sure people are out and away from danger. People have had to leave their homes with nothing at all; just the clothes on their back in many instances.

The relief effort is being bolstered by Russia and other European countries sending rescue teams in to comb through homes that have been destroyed.

Teams are also battling to save key power stations including the giant site at Kostolac near the capital Belgrade.

Alma Muslibegovic, a spokeswoman for the country's EPS power firm, said: "The army, police, volunteers and Kostolac employees are using all mechanisation and are piling up sandbags to slow the river flow and prevent it from entering the power generation system."

Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic said a fire and flooding of surface mines at the 1,300 megawatt (MW) Kolubara coal-fired power plant southwest of Belgrade had caused damage of "at least 100 million euros (£81m)".

Authorities say the economic impact of the floods will be huge, devastating the agricultural sector vital to both the Serbian and Bosnian economies.

"The danger today is less than it was yesterday, but we have to control the Sava as much as we can," Mr Vucic told a televised Cabinet session.

"These are the kind of waters not seen in 1,000 years, let alone 100."

Serbian Grand Slam tennis star Novak Djokovic, who won the Rome Masters at the weekend, has pledged to donate some 700,000 euros ($960,000) to flood victims.

He told Sky News: "It is devastating to see the images. My thoughts and emotions have been with my people and I wanted to contribute in any possible way. My foundation offers options for people to donate via bank transfer and PayPal.

"We're a country that relies on agriculture and there have been many people who have lost the mainstream of their income.

"The government is using everything in their power to get as much funds to restore the infrastructure.

"The positive thing is the people of Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia are united in these difficult times."

Grand Slam tennis champiopn Novak Djokovic says he is "devastated" by floods hitting his home country Serbia and several neighbouring countries. Djokovic is donating his winnings from the Italian Open to victims of the floods.

Three months of rainfall in three days has forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes in Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia.

The floods are the worst to hit the Balkans in more than a century.

Boats and helicopters have been used to evacuate those affected by floodwaters, which reached the second floor of homes in some parts of Bosnia.

The rain has also caused almost 300 landslides, burying dozens of houses and cars. Click through our gallery for the latest pictures.

Twenty thousand people normally live in Obrenovac not far from Belgrade but their town centre is now a deserted lagoon.

The police and the army stand guard on the roads into town.

They are deterring looters and trying to work out if they can reach any other bodies left behind by the worst floods anyone has ever seen in the Balkans.

The shop at the petrol station, the chemist next door and a cafe bar all look like they have been ram raided.

It was though the nearby river Sava that rose up after intense rainfall and crashed through their town. Some people described it as a tsunami - a deadly force of nature.

Some people did mange to scramble out on their own while others were hauled into rescue boats or helicopters - very few were able to take anything with them.

On the one road we could walk down the glass crunched underfoot. Dozens of worms have been washed out of the ground and are trying to escape the puddles on the tarmac.

The obscure mix of debris now covers the few dry parts of this town - everywhere else is still submerged.

Already twenty residents are known to have died, it is inevitable there will be more.

When the flood waters recede in the Balkans another danger will remain.

The landslides have dislodged some of the munitions which are now in unmarked places or have been washed into rivers. In some cases the mine warning signs have been washed away.

During the war about a million land mines were planted. Since then a clearance scheme has destroyed most of them but almost 120,000 remain in more than 9,000 marked minefields. The munitions have killed 601 people since 1995.

An official at Bosnia's Mine Action Center, Sasa Obradovic, said: "Mines have surfaced now in areas where they have never been,"  Bosnia has suffered more than 2,000 landslides since the crisis began last week.

This could create a more widespread problem downstream from the tributaries of the Sava river in Bosnia.

The river flows along the border with Croatia and then meets the Danube just outside Belgrade in Serbia. That in turn flows down through Bulgaria and Romania and into the Black Sea.

Experts fear that some mines could travel hundreds of miles or even become jammed in the machinery of a hydroelectric dam.

Mine clearing is a hugely expensive business. A landmine can be bought for a few dollars, but the UN estimates that it costs about $1,000 per mine to clear them once they are placed in a mine field.

As well as causing thousands of fatalities in countries no longer at war, their presence renders large areas of often agricultural land unusable for years after a conflict has ended.

Hundreds of thousands are still to be recovered and remain a daily threat in Angola, Somalia, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Chad, Vietnam, Thailand, Afghanistan, Rwanda, Bosnia, Croatia, Iraq  and many other countries.
