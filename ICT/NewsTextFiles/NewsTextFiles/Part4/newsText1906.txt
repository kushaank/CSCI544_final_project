
Kenya: The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission ( EACC ) has re-started investigations into the 18 Anglo Leasing contracts following a presidential directive issued last week.

The anti-graft agency will work with the Director of Public Prosecutions to find and charge Government officials involved in the scandal that was first exposed 10 years ago.

“We have now partnered with the DPP in the fresh investigations with a focus on the legality of all the contracts ,” EACC spokesman Yassin Amaro told The Standard.

It is the first time the DPP will be directly involved in the decade-long probe that has largely been futile.

The move comes days after President Uhuru Kenyatta ordered fresh investigations into the scandal, with a view to recovering funds that have been lost in the shoddy contracts .

Uhuru directed EACC “to do everything they can to ensure that this portion of money is recovered and Kenya gets restitution”. Amaro says the new probe will seek to expose the architects of the scheme, who would then be prosecuted by officers from the DPP. The anti-graft agency does not have prosecutorial powers, but would typically finish its investigations before the findings are handed over to the police as evidence.

EACC and its predecessor agencies have been unable to crack and expose the scandal that is feared to cost the county tens of billions.

Already, President Kenyatta had directed the national Treasury to pay Sh1.4 billion to two of the firms against disapproval by Parliament while blasting the State Law Office for failing to defend Kenya properly in foreign courts.

After the President’s criticism on Friday, the Law Society of Kenya yesterday accused Attorney General Githu Muigai of procuring an unfavourable judgement in the British court in an Anglo Leasing case where the State lost.
