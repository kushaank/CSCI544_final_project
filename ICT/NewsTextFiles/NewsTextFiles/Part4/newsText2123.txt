
Armadale, the AIM quoted investment company focused on natural resource        projects in Africa, is pleased to announce its unaudited preliminary        results for the year ended 31 December 2013.

“2013 was a transformational year for Armadale, which resulted in the        Company’s transition to an established investment company. Following        a number of strategic investments and acquisitions, Armadale has        established a strong investment proposition, providing exposure to a        blend of early stage exploration upside together with projects with        medium term cash generation prospects.

I am pleased to report on a transformational year for Armadale, which        has resulted in the Company’s transition to an established investment        company. Following a number of strategic investments and acquisitions,        Armadale has established a strong investment proposition, providing        exposure to a blend of early stage exploration upside together with        projects with medium term cash generation prospects.

Following an initial investment, in August 2013, Armadale acquired the        right to an 80% interest in the Mpokoto Gold Project (‘Mpokoto’ or ‘the        Project’) in the Katanga Province in the south of the Democratic        Republic of the Congo, which has a 506,700oz gold JORC resource        estimate. This has become the most significant investment in the Group’s        portfolio and one where the Group has management control with a view to        fulfilling a defined development plan that will see Mpokoto commence        production by the end of 2015.

Armadale’s evolution into an investment company followed the completion        of the sale of its operating subsidiary to Mine Restoration Investments        Ltd (‘MRI’) a company quoted on the AltX market of the Johannesburg        Stock Exchange. MRI is now focused on the development of profitable        operations through its coal fines processing and briquetting operation        at Vaalkrantz Colliery in KwaZulu Natal. The Company has also made and        realised value in a number of small investments in quoted Australian        mining companies.

To support the development of a diverse investment portfolio, Armadale        appointed Mr. Justin Lewis, an experienced director with extensive        experience in the African resources sector, to the Board in June 2013.        His proven operating experience combined with the Board and management        teams’ substantial skills and experience have enabled the Company to        identify prospective investment opportunities. In line with this,        Armadale has defined investment criteria and will only look to acquire        interests in African-based projects in the natural resources sector,        which offer near term cash flow and have an established core management        team in place which can be expanded over time.

In August 2013 Armadale purchased the right to an 80% stake in Mpokoto        for an aggregate consideration of £2.5 million in cash and shares. Since        acquiring the interest, Armadale has pursued a defined development        strategy, which has seen the recent Scoping Study estimate a net present        value for the Project of US$33m (£20m). Following work undertaken by the        Group, the mineral resource estimate has been increased by 33% to        507,000 ounces of gold. The results of the Stage 1 Scoping Study were        announced in April 2014, demonstrated Mpokoto to be a robust low cost        gold development project with attractive economic fundamentals even at a        gold price of US$1,100/oz.

The Scoping Study, which is based only on the shallow weathered oxide        ore body down to 40m of depth, estimated low operating costs from open        pit mining of less than US$650 per ounce of gold and a capital        requirement of around US$20m. Importantly, significant upside still        remains from the unweathered sulphide ore (>40m depth) and so with        strong economics already in place from only part of the deposit, Mpokoto        has proven itself to be highly prospective project, underpinning its        investment value.

To progress the Project, work on the Stage 2 Scoping Study, which will        target the deeper ore, has commenced. We are confident that this work        will further enhance the overall economics of Mpokoto. Additionally,        more drilling of the licence area will be undertaken in expectation of        an increase in the overall resource as well as moving up the value curve        from resources to reserves. The application for a mining licence over        Mpokoto has been lodged and we wait the granting of the licence in the        coming months; a further significant value trigger.

As a result of the sale of its then operating subsidiary, in August 2012        Armadale acquired an interest in MRI. Whilst MRI continues to make        significant progress with the commissioning of its coal fines processing        and briquetting operation at the Vaalkrantz Colliery in KwaZulu Natal        (‘the Plant’), 2013 did not see as much commercial progress as had been        forecast. We are pleased that the new Plant is now in production and MRI        has agreed a commercial agreement with Keaton Energy Holdings Ltd, owner        of Vaalkrantz Colliery, for the joint marketing of coal fines. Samples        of coal briquettes have been sent to a variety of potential customers,        with a view to establishing an economically sustainable market.

MRI has recently announced a proposed reorganisation of its balance        sheet by way of a conversion of all of existing debt into equity        (including ZAR3.2m currently owed to the Company) at a price of ZAR0.05        per MRI share. As a result, MRI will no longer be burdened with        significant debt and the revenue and profits will not be encumbered by        these significant debt repayments.

Finally, it is worth noting that during the year we have made and        realised investments in quoted Australian mining companies where we were        familiar with the management and the projects. We have realised two of        them at a small profit and retain stakes in the other two. We expect to        continue these opportunistic purchases where we see value upside. Our        prime focus, however, is to continue to build a small portfolio of        highly prospective mining investments in Africa where we can bring our        skills and experience in early stage projects to bear and build long        term value for shareholders.

The Group does not have any revenue and is reporting a loss of which the        significant proportion relates to our share of the losses of MRI and the        impairment of the value of our investments related to MRI. The Board is obliged to review the carrying value of our investments and in respect        of the Company’s investment in MRI, it is the Board’s opinion that the        prevailing value in the MRI investment should reflect the current        underlying value of the MRI shares. The Board have used the price at        which the current re-organisation of MRI’s balance sheet is taking        place, being ZAR 0.05 per MRI share. During the year under review the        Group’s total assets increased to £4.866 million and is funded for the        next stages of the development of Mpokoto.

During the year under review Armadale has completed its transformation        into a diversified investment company focused on investing in natural        resource projects in Africa.

The Company’s investment portfolio is divided into actively managed        investments, where the Company has majority ownership and management        control of the investment, and passively managed projects, where the        Company has a minority investment, typically in a quoted company, and        does not have management control.

The Company acquired its interest in Mpokoto through the acquisition of        Netcom Global Inc, which has a contractual right to an 80% interest of        Mpokoto. The acquisition was completed on 15 November 2013 following an        initial cash investment and Armadale issued 350m shares to the vendors        with a further 350m shares due to be issued once a Mining Licence is        granted for Mpokoto. In addition, Armadale agreed to issue, in        aggregate, a further 220m shares upon completion of certain milestones.        The aggregate consideration, paid in cash and shares of approximately        £2.5 million, is reflected in the carrying value of this investment.

A specific Mining Licence was applied for over the Mpokoto Project at        the end of March 2014, which carves the Mpokoto Project out of the        existing larger licence. It is anticipated that the new Mining Licence        will be granted within the next four months pursuant to the existing        convention with the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The Study is based upon the updated JORC 2012 compliant Mineral Resource        Estimate announced on 2 April 2014. The Study demonstrates very positive        returns with robust economics, which supports conducting further work,        including the development of Stage 2, the planned drilling programme and        further metallurgical studies (the ‘Programme’). The Programme will        focus on expanding the overall Project, in particular the expansion of        the existing Mineral Resource and the development of Stage 2 of the        Project.

The 60,000tpm scenario generates a post-tax NPV of US$33.0 million at a        gold price of US$1,250 per ounce and at an 8% discount rate. Importantly        the Project remains robust at significantly lower gold prices, with a        post-tax NPV of US$18.8m at US$1,100/oz gold price and an 8% discount        rate.

Mpokoto requires a total capital cost of US$20.2 million, on the basis        of using a contract miner who will provide the mining fleet. The total        payback period is 20 months.

The Company will shortly commence the next stages of the development        plan for Mpokoto, with a view to commencing production before the end of        2015. The Scoping Study in respect of Stage 2 has already commenced,        relating to the deeper unweathered sulphide ore which are anticipated        will be mined and processed following Stage 1 of the Project.

the expansion of the current overall mineral resource, in particular          converting the Exploration Targets into Mineral Resource status;

providing samples for additional metallurgical studies to be          undertaken to allow greater understanding of the metallurgy of the          Project.

It is anticipated that these tasks will be completed within the next six        months, in conjunction with the granting of a mining licence over        Mpokoto. The results and data of this work will then be used in a        feasibility study for the whole project, which will be used to secure        finance.

Armadale is committed to sustainable development and conducting its        business ethically. Given that the Company invests in the mining        industry, Armadale focuses on health and safety, being environmentally        responsible, and supporting the communities close to its investments.

MRI’s main activities are the commercialisation of its coal fines        processing and briquetting operation and the development of a long term        solution to the treatment for AMD. The Company currently holds 36.6% per        cent of the issued share capital of MRI, which is listed on the AltX        exchange in South Africa. The shareholding was a result of the        acquisition of Armadale’s operating subsidiary in August 2012 by MRI for        a combination of cash and shares in MRI. A portion of the cash was lent        to a major shareholder of MRI secured against further shares of MRI.        During the year MRI has raised further funding by entering into debt        facilities, which are repayable in July 2014. In addition, the Company        lent a further £110,913 to MRI post period end. Following the year end        MRI has announced that it has reached an agreement with a substantial        proportion of its creditors, including the Company, to convert        outstanding debt into equity at ZAR0.05 per MRI share.

As noted above, the Company has made a loan of ZAR15 million to another        major shareholder of MRI, secured on a further 15.6 per cent of the        issued share capital of MRI. The loan note is currently outstanding and        overdue repayment, whilst the Company remains in discussions to ensure        its repayment, the Directors are exploring all options available to        ensure repayment. Pending its repayment, the Directors have provided        against the carrying value of the loan to the current market value of        the underlying security in shares of MRI as reflected by the balance        sheet reorganisation of MRI described above.

MRI completed the construction and commissioning of a coal fines        processing and briquetting plant (‘the Plant’) at an anthracite coal        mine, Vaalkrantz Colliery, in the KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa        in November 2013. Whilst the original timetable was delayed, the        finalisation of commissioning and commencement of commercial production,        which began in January 2014, is a significant milestone for MRI.        Importantly, MRI recently announced post period end in May 2014, that it        has finalised a commercial agreement with Keaton Energy Holdings Ltd,        owner of Vaalkrantz Colliery, for the joint marketing of coal fines and        briquettes. MRI is currently producing coal fines exclusively for Keaton        and samples of coal briquettes have also been sent to a number of        potential customers with a view to establishing an economically        sustainable market.

The Plant is now configured to enable the operation of a fully        autonomous washing and screening operation to process the coal fines        with the option to incorporate the briquetting process when required.        This ability to process the coal fines separately from the briquetting        operation will help to maximise cost efficiencies.

Post period end in March 2014 the Plant produced a total of 1,900 tonnes        of coal fines. 492 tonnes have been sold to date with the remainder        stockpiled in anticipation of the next delivery to Keaton which is        expected shortly. Through the optimisation of operations MRI intend to        ramp-up production, targeting 4,800 tonnes of coal fines in May 2014.

The next step is for MRI to seek further sites to build additional        plants and roll out the concept. In addition, MRI is looking to trial        innovative screening equipment to greatly increase the yield of coal        fine screens with improved quality.

The completion of this initial Plant and agreement for the sale of coal        fines will result in maiden revenues for MRI, which the Directors        believe will underpin the intrinsic value of MRI.

MRI’s other business, treatment of acid mine drainage (‘AMD’) in the        Witwatersrand basins, has not progressed in the last 12 months. The        treatment process, jointly developed with the Council for Scientific and        Industrial Research (CSIR), and accepted by the affected mining        companies as the most effective solution for the treatment of AMD, has        not been readily adopted by the Department of Water Affairs in South        Africa. As a consequence, MRI continue to wait for the outcome of the        tender to determine a long-term solution with the expectation that some        of our intellectual property and know-how will be adopted in making a        contribution to the resolution of this long standing issue.

MRI does not anticipate that its solution for AMD will be adopted by the        Department of Water Affairs in South Africa in the near term. MRI        continues to look at other applications for its technology and also        continues to see interest from mining companies in South Africa, who        have a responsibility to find a solution to AMD, but the management of        MRI do not believe that MRI’s technology will be commercialised in the        near term.

As a significant shareholder in MRI, the Company is required to account        for MRI as an associate company and consolidate our share of MRI losses        into our accounts, which, together with an impairment charge, has        resulted in a decrease in the carrying value of the investment in MRI by        approximately £1.6 million. The Directors are actively looking at        opportunities to realise its investment in MRI as well as recover the        proceeds of the loan outstanding to a shareholder of MRI.

The Company has a small portfolio of quoted investments, principally in        gold production companies where the directors believe there are        opportunities for capital gain. During the year the Company has bought        and sold investments and continues to keep its portfolio under active        review.

For the year ended 31 December 2013 Armadale did not earn any revenues        as its business related solely to the making of investments into        non-revenue producing resource projects and companies.

The Company is reporting interest income of £116,797. Armadale made a        loss before tax of £3.148 million for the year ended 31 December 2013.        This included administrative expenses of £770,277 in 2013, increased        from £411,456 in 2012, principally as a result of expenses associated        with fundraising and other corporate actions.

The loss includes our share of the loss in MRI, together with an        impairment of the Company’s investment in MRI in 2013 amounting to        £1.624 million and a provision against a loan secured against MRI shares        of £773,000. The Board is obliged to periodically review the carrying        value of the Armadale’s investments to determine if there has been any        impairment in their values. Following such a review of the Company’s        investment in MRI, the Board have used the price at which the current        re-organisation of MRI’s balance sheet is taking place, being ZAR0.05,        even though MRI currently trades at significant premium to this carrying        value. The impairments described above therefore reflect appropriate        provisions in the financial statements that have been made to reflect        this valuation.

The audited financial statements of the Company are expected to be              available on the Company’s website www.armadalecapital.com in the first week of June 2014.
