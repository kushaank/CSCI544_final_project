
FLUSHING MEADOWS CORONA PARK, Queens (PIX11) – At the 1964-65 New York World’s Fair, 51 Million people visited Flushing Meadows Corona Park for a glimpse into the future.

Whether it was the tent of tomorrow, microwave ovens, videophones or computers, it was all awe-inspiring.

If you were there, who could forget the slick cars from Detroit, futuristic underwater houses, moving pedestrian sidewalks, the Pieta, on loan from the Vatican and a monorail overhead.

Jim Beckerman remembers everyone wearing funny German hats.

“I really, really wanted one,” he told PIX11.

“I remember Belgian waffles,” David Morillo said, so he returned to go find them tasting even better today.

While the New York State pavilion and observation tower look a little rusty, the memories of those returning are not.

Jose Quijano showed PIX11 the dance he did in the New York State Pavilion, part of their salute to Native Americans.

There were some in the crowd who even attended the 1939 World’s Fair, celebrating its 75th anniversary.

“I was five-years-old and everything was wonderful,” Angela Rodin told PIX11.
