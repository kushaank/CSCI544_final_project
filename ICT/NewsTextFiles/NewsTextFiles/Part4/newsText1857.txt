
AUCHI (Edo State) - The Edo People’s Initiatives, a civil society group, yesterday urged Governor Adams Oshiomhole of Edo to sustain his people-oriented developmental projects till the end of his tenure.

The group made the call at a press briefing at Auchi, headquarters of the Etsako-West Local Goverment Area of the state.

The leader of the group, Chief Halims Okhidemeh, described the governor’s achievement as “unprecedented’’ in the history of Edo.

Okhidemeh said that Oshiomhole’s effort in transforming the state was worth emulating by any politician aspiring for any position in the country.

He said that the essence of governance was to impact on the lives of the people through people-oriented policies that would foster development.

“The Edo People’s Initiatives congratulate the Edo state governor for the massive transformation of our state from a very recent decadent past into shining examples of political and economic prosperity.

“The delivery of democracy dividends to the people of Edo State by this administration has been awesome as manifested in the construction of good roads, provision of potable water, youth empowerment, infrastructure and employment programmes,’’ he said.

Okhidemeh said that the development of infrastructure by the government did not only transform the state into a viable social and economic state, but also showed that government was committed to ensuring that the people enjoyed democratic dividends.

“The comrade governor’s administration is most apt when we retrospect into our recent political past before now.

“As we embrace the focus and positive administration of the present, Edo people should resist politicians who are bent on returning the state to its inglorious past,’’ he added.

The group leader also urged people of the state to continue to support the current administration to ensure the continuity of the delivery of dividends of democracy.
