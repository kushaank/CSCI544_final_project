
I met Friday at Wired Cafe with U.S. Rep. Cheri Bustos, who represents most of Rockford’s west side, Freeport and west to the Mississippi River. She and other congresswomen from both parties spent Mother’s Day in Afghanistan with female U.S. troops. During her nearly weeklong visit, Bustos, D-East Moline, questioned U.S. generals and Afghans about the American troop withdrawal and what might happen when we’re gone. She traveled into dangerous territory.

Bustos recounted a meeting she had with Afghan girls: “The girls we met with, ages 13 to 18, would not have been able to go to school earlier. We asked them to raise their hands if they fear the Taliban. Nearly every one of the girls raised their hands.

I asked her if the U.S. presence has made a difference in 13 years.

“A general told us it wasn’t until 2008 and 2009 that progress started to be made. The general said that to change a culture is a 30- to 40-year commitment.” I asked her if the U.S. is getting out completely.

I asked Bustos if she thinks our occupation of Afghanistan was worth the cost in human lives and dollars.

U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger who represents most of Rockford’s east side and Belvidere, called Sunday for the resignation of Veterans Affairs Sec. Eric Shinseki. Kinzinger, R-Channahon, spoke as a guest on “Meet the Press,” where the topic was the growing scandal at the Veterans Administration over a cover-up of delayed care in VA hospitals around the country. Whistleblowers have charged that 40 people have died nationwide due to the extreme delays.

Page 2 of 2 - Host David Gregory asked Kinzinger, an Air Force veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and a pilot in the Illinois Air National Guard, how the delays in veterans’ care became so serious and widespread.
