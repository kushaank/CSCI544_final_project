
Two women and four men have been arrested in connection with the killing of a woman in Giyani.

They believed the woman had bewitched her sister-in-law, Limpopo police said on Sunday.

Two of the accused were arrested in Polokwane and the others were arrested in and around Giyani over the past few days, said Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi.

On April 27, Catherina Nkovani, 52, was attacked and assaulted after her sister-in-law's funeral.

“The sister-in-law, Phindile Nkovani, was sick for quite some time before she died earlier in April. Following her funeral, members of the community, including the husband of the deceased, accused Nkovani of bewitching the deceased,” Mulaudzi said.

Nkovani was assaulted with various objects and set alight. She died the following day in Khesani Hospital.

Those arrested were believed to be Nkovani's relatives. They would appear in the Giyani Magistrate's Court on Monday to face charges of public violence and murder.
