
A proposed hard rock quarry at Port Stephens is the focus of a Planning Assessment Commission meeting today, amid concerns by some local residents.

Karuah East Quarry - a subsidiary of Hunter Quarries, wants to develop a hard rock quarry.

It will produce up to 1.5 million tonnes of hard rock each year for 20 years.

It is located next to the existing Karuah Quarry, due to close in five years.

No Government authorities have objected to the proposal but concerns have been raised about potential environmental impacts.

Residents are worried about biodiversity impacts from the removal of threatened species.

They are also concerned about noise, air quality and traffic impacts of the new quarry.
