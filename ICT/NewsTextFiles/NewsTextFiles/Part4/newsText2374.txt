TREASURER Michael O'Brien and Health Minister David Davis will be visiting Bendigo today.

Mr Davis will visit the new Bendigo Hospital site and Mr O'Brien will visit the site of the proposed Greater Bendigo Indoor Aquatic Leisure and Wellbeing Centre, after the state government allocated $15 million to the project in the recent state budget.

The council has lobbied the federal government for the additional $5 million and Cr Lyons will visit Canberra soon to raise the issue but no commitment has yet been made.

The politicians' visits come after the state premiers, including Denis Napthine, lambasted the federal government for pulling $80 billion from state funding.

The Labor Party has calculated that Bendigo Health will have have $24.8 million stripped from its budget by mid-2018.

Check the Bendigo Advertiser website throughout the day for updates on the politicians' visits.
