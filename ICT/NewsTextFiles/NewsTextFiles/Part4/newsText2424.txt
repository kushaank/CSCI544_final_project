
A dip in the Bangalee river at Velabari of Shariakandi in Bogra turned into a nightmare for five cousins and siblings yesterday afternoon. Two of them died and the rest are in hospitals.

Mostakim Taj, 20, first year student of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (Buet) and Rifat Ahmed, 21, a second year student of Green University College of Dhaka, died when they went to the river to bathe.

They fell into an underwater trench dredged by sand lifters. Rifat's sister Nadira Binte Rija, 18, student of Eden University College, Dhaka, Shama Akhtar, 18, a medical representative, and Babu, 24, a student of Government Azizul Haque College of Bogra, got injured when they tried to save the two from drowning.

Family sources said the five had gone to bathe in the river during their visit to their village home to see their grandmother.

They said Taj and Rifat fell into the underwater trench and started to drown and the others went in to rescue them but began to drown themselves. Locals later pulled them all out but Taj and Rifat died on their way to a clinic in Bogra.

Rija and Babu were moved to Dhaka in the evening from a private clinic in Bogra town, family sources said.
