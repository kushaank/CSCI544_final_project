
The number of HIV infection cases reached 238 in Armenia in 2013.

"This is the highest annual index since 1989, when the first time HIV infection was registered in Armenia," Head of Epidemiological Diseases Department at AIDS Prevention Republican Centre Arshak Papoyan told local journalists.

He went on to add that 111 new cases of infection were registered in the country during the first four months of 2014.

"Some 11 people infected by AIDS died in the last four months. People aged 25- 39 years is among high-risk group," Papoyan said.

He further noted that the infection ways have significantly changed over the past ten years. "Some 75 percent of HIV infection is caused by migration. People who returned back to the country are the main carriers of the infection," he said.

Armenia is still not able to avoid mass immigration. From 2008 to 2013, immigration reached 30,000-35,000 people per year.

The statistics of the first quarter of 2014 is also very unpleasant.

The number of people who left Armenia by air exceeded the number of arrivals by 21,686 in the first quarter of 2014. Some 186,493 people departed from Yerevan's airport, while only 164,807 arrived at it.

The number of citizens who left Armenia in the first quarter of 2014 was 21,218 more than the same period in 2013.
