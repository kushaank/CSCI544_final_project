
Meet Rocky Fisher.

The 35-year-old bank robbery suspect was wearing a t-shirt declaring “It’s all fun & games until the cops show up” when police showed up yesterday morning and arrested him as he exited an Idaho motel.

Fisher and Jennifer Balfe, 19, were collared in connection with Friday’s robbery of a U.S. Bank branch in Cottonwood (pop. 900). They were each jailed on robbery, burglary, and grand theft counts.

Investigators reportedly got on Fisher’s tail after receiving an anonymous tip that a man matching the suspect’s description had been spending wads of cash at a local casino.
