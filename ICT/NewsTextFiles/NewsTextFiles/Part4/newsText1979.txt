The Sulu Sea to the southwest lies between the country and the island of Borneo , and to the south the Celebes Sea separates it from other islands of Indonesia . It is bounded on the east by the Philippine Sea . Its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire and its tropical climate make the Philippines prone to earthquakes and typhoons but have also endowed the country with natural resources and made it one of the richest areas of biodiversity in the world. An archipelago comprising 7,107 islands, the Philippines is categorized broadly into three main geographical divisions: Luzon , Visayas , and Mindanao . Its capital city is Manila .

With an estimated population of about 98 million people, the Philippines is the 7th most populated Asian country and the 12th most populated country in the world . An additional 12.5 million Filipinos live overseas . Multiple ethnicities and cultures are found throughout the islands. In prehistoric times, Negritos were some of the archipelago's earliest inhabitants. They were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples who brought with them influences from Malay , Hindu , and Islamic societies. Trade introduced Chinese cultural influences which remain to this day.
