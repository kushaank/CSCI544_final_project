
Four members of a family, three of them children, were burnt to death in an arson attack in Gopalganj Sadar upazila on Saturday night.

The dead are Huriya Begum, 65, her grandsons Aminur Sardar, 14, and Tamim Fakir, 8, and granddaughter Tanima, 6, of Dumdia village.

Sharifa Begum, daughter of Huriya, alleged that her husband Azad Mollah was behind the attack. Sharifa used to live with her mother in Dumdia after Azad's second marriage.

Sharifa said two days before the incident, Azad came to her mother's house, and told her to go with him. As she did not agree to Azad's proposal, he threatened to kill everybody by setting their house on fire.

Meanwhile, police arrested Azad in connection with the incident from Narail district yesterday afternoon. He confessed to his involvement in the attack.

Locals said the house was torched by kerosene being poured on it around 11:00pm when everybody inside was fast asleep.
