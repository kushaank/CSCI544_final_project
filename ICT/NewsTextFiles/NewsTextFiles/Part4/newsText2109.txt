
Florida residents are being warned to take precautions after a new mosquito-borne illness was found in three residents.

The Florida Department of Health received three reports of Floridians recently returned from the Caribbean with chikungunya fever, a fever-like viral illness transmitted by mosquitos. The infected residents are all women from Broward, Miami-Dade, and Hillsborough counties.

Outbreaks of chikungunya in St. Maarten and other Caribbean islands have resulted in travel warnings and increased anti-mosquito measures to contain the virus. Chikungunya has traveled to Caribbean areas from Africa, Asia, and Pacific islands. It could be possible for tourists to travel back to the United States with the virus.

Symptoms include fever, severe joint pain, muscle pain, headaches, or a rash. The joint pain can be persistent. Symptoms usually surface three to seven days after an infected mosquito bites a victim.
