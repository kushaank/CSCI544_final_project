
THE African National Congress’s (ANC’s) national executive committee (NEC) will on Monday kick off the week with a special election postmortem.

Three main topics are expected to dominate the discussions — an analysis of the areas where the ANC lost support, the appointment of premiers and the new Cabinet.

The party mainly lost support in the metropolitan areas and in Gauteng. While leaders have said they are humbled by the loyalty of ANC voters, they have also acknowledged that in the run-up to the 2016 municipal elections and the 2019 national poll the ANC needs to pull out all the stops to prove that it can improve on the way it runs the government, especially in municipalities.

The NEC meeting is expected to discuss who will take up the post of premier in each of the eight provinces the party has won. Although these positions are set to go to the provincial chairmen in each of these provinces in order to avoid two centres of power in provincial structures, this is not a given.

The third focus of the meeting will be the cabinet President Jacob Zuma is due to appoint after his inauguration on Saturday. Mr Zuma’s second inauguration will follow the first sitting of the fifth Parliament on Wednesday.

Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng will preside over this sitting, which will officially elect Mr Zuma for a second presidential term and appoint Parliament’s new team of presiding officers, including the speaker. The 400 MPs representing the 13 parties that secured seats in the election will be sworn in.

All the provincial legislatures will hold their first sittings on Wednesday as well and nominate delegates to the National Council of Provinces (NCOP). These delegates will be sworn in at the NCOP in Cape Town on Thursday.

on Monday, the Constitutional Court will hear arguments in the ground-breaking Zimbabwe torture case, brought by the Southern Africa Litigation Centre and the Zimbabwean Exiles Forum. The case is aimed at forcing South Africa to abide by its domestic and international legal obligations to investigate and prosecute high-level Zimbabwean officials accused of crimes against humanity. This is the final stage of the landmark case that began in 2008 when the two bodies handed over a dossier of evidence to the South African National Prosecuting Authority and the South African Police Services.

The dossier alleged that state-sanctioned torture was carried out in Zimbabwe, following a police raid on the headquarters of the Movement for Democratic Change in 2007.

Also on Monday, the African National Congress Women’s League will address a media conference on its programme of action that seeks to mobilise support for efforts to bring the kidnapped Nigerian girls back home. This follows a weekend meeting at which interested parties, including women’s organisations, nongovernmental and men’s organisations got together to discuss actions that South Africa can take to help bring back the girls safely.

Alien and invasive species, especially trout, will be the focus of a media briefing by the Department of Environmental Affairs on Monday. The department will explain the recently published regulations of the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act, 2004 and what this will mean for eliminating and controlling alien and invasive species.

On Tuesday members of the South African National Defence Force who are accused of violating the Military Disciplinary Supplementary Measures Act by participating in an illegal protest march to the Union Buildings in August 2009, will hear their fate. The trial was initially scheduled for March 18 this year but was postponed until May 20.

The postponement followed an interdict to halt the proceedings for which the South African National Defence Union had applied pending the pronouncement of a North Gauteng High Court order, which granted an application for separate trials.

This means that charges of "going awol" will be prosecuted separately from the main public violence case.
