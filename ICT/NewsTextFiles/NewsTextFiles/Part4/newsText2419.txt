
Jatiyatabadi Ainjibi Forum (JAF) has taken a huge preparation to ensure a big gathering in the rally on the Supreme Court Lawyers' Association premises, AM Mahbub Uddin Khokon, secretary general of JAF, told reporters at a press conference yesterday.

BNP wants to create public opinion against the Sheikh Hasina government through holding a series of rallies protesting the Narayanganj seven-murder, the party sources said. Three former officials of Rab-11 were allegedly involved in the murder.

Khaleda is also scheduled to visit Munshiganj on May 28 to attend a rally there, said the sources.

Meanwhile, BNP yesterday criticised Sheikh Hasina for comparing her government's mandate with that of Indian BJP.

“Prime Minister in her message to Narendra Modi said, 'You have a big mandate as Bangladesh Awami League has. So we want to work together',” BNP acting secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said at a programme at the Jatiya Press Club.  “By making such remarks, she not only undermined herself but also undermined the country,” he said.
