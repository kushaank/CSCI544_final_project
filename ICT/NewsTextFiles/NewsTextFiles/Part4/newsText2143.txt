
Wynberg - The Organised Crime Unit of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (the Hawks) in Gauteng secured a 30-year conviction against Frank Nabolisa today.

Forty-six-year-old Nabolisa, who is a drug convict, is currently serving his 12 years’ imprisonment with his co-convict, Sherl Cwele, in a separate case. He appeared in the Wynberg Regional Court for his sentence today after he was found guilty in other drug-related offences earlier this year.

In May 2011, the Pietermaritzburg High Court convicted Nabolisa and Cwele for dealing in drugs. They recruited Tessa Beetge to transport drugs to Brazil where she was arrested and served a prison term.

On 3 December 2009, Nabolisa was also charged for dealing in dangerous dependence-producing drugs, and contravening the Medicine and Related Substances Act, 1965 (Act No 101 of 1965). He was found to be in possession of 2,4 kg of cocaine, 5,8 kg of paracetamol and 2,7 kg of Hexamine at one of his drug storage facilities in Ivory Park, Johannesburg.

Today, the Wynberg Regional Court sentenced him to 20 years’ imprisonment for dealing in drugs and 10 years’ imprisonment for contravening the Medicine and Related Substances Act, 1965 (Act No 101 of 1965). He will serve these sentences concurrently, after serving his 12-year sentence.
