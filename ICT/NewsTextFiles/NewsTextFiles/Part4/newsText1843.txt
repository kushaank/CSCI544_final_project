
Ayutthaya officials will check 30 dumpsites as some are reportedly operating illegally and lack a good garbage-management system.

Law-violating landlords and negligent local officials will be punished, said a senior official yesterday.

Deputy provincial Governor Panya Srathongun yesterday inspected the dump in tambon Mae La of Nakhon Luang district where a fire broke out on Sunday.

It has been brought under control although smoke could be seen at several spots.

Panya said no one was affected by the fire, which the authorities brought under control in a timely manner and were now using backhoes and water horses to extinguish the fire.

He said an inspection found some garbage was dumped without permission and its trash management was not proper. Lime and EM was sprinkled to eradicate the foul smell.

Panya said that in the past month Ayutthaya had seen four fire incidents in Muang Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya, Tha Rua, Nakhon Luang and Bang Pa-in districts, so officials had to be stricter.
