
THE Competition Commission has become almost a household name thanks to its high-profile cases in recent years, fighting collusive conduct in key sectors such as food, intermediate industrial products and construction.

But it also made headlines over internal leadership struggles, infighting, a high staff turnover and even a scandal that saw the resignation of former commissioner Shan Ramburuth over visits to adult websites using government resources. It seems the tide has turned, and on Monday Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel is expected to announce the appointment of a permanent head for the commission. Acting commissioner Thembinkosi Bonakele stepped in at the end of last year and has started pulling things together.

He had left the commission in March last year when infighting and leadership problems were at their worst. But after Mr Ramburuth’s resignation, Mr Patel asked Mr Bonakele to return to what was then a tumultuous organisation.

Several key people left over a period of less than two years, including the chief economist, chief financial officer and, most recently, deputy commissioner Trudi Makhaya. Staff turnover for 2012-13 was 20%, against the previous year’s 11.4%. The commission said a lack of opportunities for career progression was the main reason.

"It was a privilege in a sense to be asked to come and sort it out (the discontent in the ranks of the commission), but it was quite a daunting challenge. The fact that I had been here before had its own disadvantages, but also a lot of advantages because I knew the institution, I knew the people and some of the problems," Mr Bonakele says.

The disadvantages were that he walked into a situation where there was unhappiness and conflict and the possibility of being dragged into it. "I had to rise above all of that and rebuild unity and cohesion, first in the management team and then among staff members. I am very happy in terms of the stability within the management team and very happy with the staff morale. I can confidently tell you that we have resolved a lot of the issues that were the source of discontent."

In January this year the commission announced three senior appointments — chief economist, chief financial officer, and the head of enforcement and exemptions — all from within the commission.

"Leadership and stability within leadership in any institution, private or public, is a critical success factor. It is essential. If leaders do nothing else but stabilise and point to a vision, then everything else falls into place. That is my fundamental belief," he says.

"My worry about the commission has always been about those things. I will be the first one to admit that if you have problems at leadership level, that it will have an impact on the workings of the organisation. Our fortune was that the organisation is quite resilient, has a good public record and has fairly resilient systems in place."

He has been shaped by the sociopolitical context of his time. He describes himself as a keen political and social observer, and sometimes a keen participant as well. He went to high school the same year the late Nelson Mandela was released.

"Ingrained in my thinking and emotion are the notion of justice, equality, fairness and inclusiveness. That drives me. In my capacity as commissioner I see great opportunities to make the commission a key partner in the economic management of the country," he says.

He says the commission has some loose ends to tie up — notably its continued prosecution of construction companies that did not participate in the fast-track settlement process to rid the industry of cartel conduct. The commission fined 15 companies a total of R1.4bn and will continue to prosecute those who did not settle.

Several municipalities have indicated they will seek civil damages, and there has been co-operation between the commission and the National Prosecuting Authority on the imposition of criminal charges relating to fraud and corruption in tender processes.

"We want finality, whilst respecting that there are other authorities with jurisdiction, and equally respecting public opinion that justice ought to be done … I am still figuring out how we can help with those processes."

In future he wants to focus on stamping out abuse of dominance conduct in the economy. The commission has had limited success with its prosecutions in this field — notably against the South African Airways and Telkom. It has been less successful against South African Breweries.

The increased intervention of the Department of Economic Development in merger control has raised eyebrows. Is he concerned about this? Business has got to get used to it, he says. The Competition Act entitles the government to participate in merger applications regarding public interest concerns, notably potential job losses. The commission and the Competition Tribunal themselves have to distinguish what public interest issues are within the act and other public interest issues.

"I do not think we should be afraid to get into the debate. The thing I do not like is that people think government should not be entering the debate. If people trust that we are resilient organisations, we should be able to withstand any pressure that is coming our way."

In other countries the executive has the power to simply overrule the decisions by the competition authorities. In South Africa the executive has to go to court — like everybody else — if it is unhappy with the decisions. "You can also ask whether it is appropriate for a government to play such an activist role. Now that is a political question, that I will not answer," he says, laughing.

He is excited about the vibrancy of South African society.

"We are all still living the (Nelson) Mandela legacy. There is no doubt about that. However, what is missing is a sense that all have a stake in South Africa — politically and economically," he says.

"A lot of our problems will go away when everybody truly has a stake in the economy. I see us all playing our small part in that inclusive growth."

Although work can be all-consuming, he enjoys the arts — particularly the theatre and music.

He admits he is a bad judge of people. He refers to Mandela’s view on the human spirit. "The one thing I have learnt from him is that there is something inherently good in people, and you can always appeal to that."
