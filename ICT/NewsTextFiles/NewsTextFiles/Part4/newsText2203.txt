
Dear COLLOQUY Readers,

We recently underwent a server upgrade and ran into a few issues with the site on the new server.  As you may notice, there are still some areas of the site that are not fully     functional and we are working hard to ensure the site is back to normal as soon as possible.  Our apologies for the inconvenience and we thank you for your patience.
