
While the County Commissioners have been in charged with coordinating national government operations, as well as chairing security and intelligence boards, the President opted to literally own the officers in question by placing them under his direct command. Referring to them as “my officers”, Uhuru asked the commissioners to serve as the extension of his office across the country.

And he asked them to act as his “eyes and ears”, even teasing that “if I am awake because of national duty, I equally do not expect you to be asleep”.

While the President and senior officials of his government consider the development as restructuring of his administration and civil service, the Opposition as well as the Council of Governors (CoG) view the latest move as a plot to delegate extra power to county commissioners and further strangle devolution.

CoG Chairman, Isaac Ruto, terms the President’s move a violation of the Constitution and a deliberate assault on devolution. The Bomet Governor threatened legal action if the national government does not reverse Uhuru’s decision.

“We cannot support a chaotic thinking that revives and redefines the Provincial Administration. The governor is by law the chief executive of counties and we shall not allow a situation where we have two CEOs in the counties,” he told The Standard On Sunday.

“We must support devolution by recognising the governor as the county CEO. Anything to the contrary will create confusion and parallel administrative structures and that will only allow insecurity to thrive,” said Wetangula, co-principal of the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD).
