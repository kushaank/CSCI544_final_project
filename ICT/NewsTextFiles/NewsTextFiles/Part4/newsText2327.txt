
The Australian coal industry’s controversial claims that coal is needed to lift billions out of poverty have received the most significant set back yet, with the release of a new report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).

The report, based on detailed financial modelling, reveals that for India to import coal from Australia for power generation is ‘prohibitively expensive’, and double the wholesale price of India’s electricity.

“The report further breaks the myth that coal can alleviate poverty in India. Adding to the already disastrous track record of coal in killing thousands of lives and livelihoods, the economic reasons against coal imports from Australia are now irrefutable” said  350.org  South Asia Coordinator Chaitanya Kumar.

Economic modelling in the report shows that renewable energy, including wind and solar would be significantly cheaper and effective at lifting hundreds of millions in India out of energy poverty. The cost of electricity generation from solar in India has fallen 65% in the last 3 years alone.

The report findings deal a serious blow to the claims by the Minerals Council of Australia, BHP Billiton, Adani, GVK Hancock and others that Australian coal is a financially sound and morally responsible investment.
