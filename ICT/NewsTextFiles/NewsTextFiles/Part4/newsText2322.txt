THE Salvation Army is rallying its troops in preparation for the annual Red Shield Appeal Doorknock on the weekend of May 24-25.

Salvation Army spokesman Major Bruce Harmer said it was only through the generosity of people that the organisation was able to support people in need.

"By giving a few hours of your time on the Red Shield Appeal Doorknock weekend you will be helping us to help over one million people in need," Major Harmer said.

"Without the generous support of Australians in every suburb and town across the country, the Salvation Army could not reach this goal of $10 million this year. The funds go directly to support Salvation Army programs and social services."

The Salvation Army is in a unique position to assist individuals and families who fall on hard times, whether it's with immediate needs such as food or over the long term with financial, drug, alcohol and gambling rehabilitation services, as well as skills development and job placement.
