
SEATTLE (AP) — Seattle Mayor Ed Murray called a news conference Monday to announce a new police chief.

Murray said over the weekend he made an offer that was accepted.

A search committee had narrowed a list of candidates to three: former Boston police commissioner Kathleen O’Toole, Elk Grove, California Police Chief Robert Lehner, and Mesa, Arizona, Police Chief Frank Milstead.

The city has had several interim chiefs since John Diaz announced his retirement in April 2013 after a three-year tenure.

The new Seattle chief will take over a department of about 1,300 officers under federal oversight to carry out a reform agreement.

Federal investigators found in 2011 that officers to often escalated situations unnecessarily and sometimes used excessive force. The Justice Department also raised concerns about biased policing.
