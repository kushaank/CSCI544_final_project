Scientists in Argentina recently made a discovery that's rewriting the record books:  a dinosaur as long as two semi trucks and weighs more than 14 African elephants.

The Paleontological Museum Egidio Feruglio led a dig in Chubut province, Argentina, that yielded the discovery of seven massive dinosaurs in the same area , all of this same new species, according to NBC News.

Because the fossils were in relatively good shape and few bones were missing, scientists are confident their estimates on the species' height and weight are accurate, José Luis Carballido, a specialist at the museum, told NBC.

Still, further testing will be necessary to determine whether the estimates are correct or will need revision. According to the BBC, the previous record-holder – the Argentinosaurus – was first believed to weigh up to 100 tons when unearthed, but was later scaled back to about 70 tons. This new species, which remains unnamed, is estimated to weigh about 77 tons. When standing with its neck up, it was 65 feet tall.

As NPR notes, that's about as tall as the Great Sphinx in Egypt .

"It will be named describing its magnificence and in honor to both the region and the farm owners who alerted us about the discovery," researchers told NPR.

Like Argentinosaurus, the newly-discovered fossils came from a species of herbivores, not carnivores. According to the Washington Post, it belonged to a sauropod subgroup called Titanosaur, which lived nearly 100 million years ago .

Once confirmed, the new dinosaur species will be the largest to ever walk the Earth, but if the estimates are correct, it will not surpass the blue whale as the heaviest creature ever, NPR says.
