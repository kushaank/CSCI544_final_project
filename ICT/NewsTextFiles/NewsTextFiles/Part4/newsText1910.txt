
Mr Niwattumrong and Justice Minister Chaikasem Nitisiri met two representatives of the Senate in an undisclosed location yesterday to avoid disruption from protesters.

A group of about 70 senators, most of whom are seen as siding with anti-government protesters, proposed a framework last Friday that called for a government with full power to conduct political reforms.

Political deadlock had intensified since former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra dissolved parliament’s lower house in December to prepare for elections.

A court ousted her and nine cabinet ministers earlier this month for abuse of power.

But the well-heeled right-wing opposition rejects new polls without what it calls “reforms,” which include installing a prime minister by appointment rather than election.

“After being informed of the government’s clear stance, the Senate will move on to other plans,” said the Senate coordinating panel’s Wanchai Sornsiri.

Anti-government protesters said they were making their final push to oust the government and install an unelected prime minister and government.

They began searching for members of the cabinet at their homes yesterday to press them to resign but did not find any.
