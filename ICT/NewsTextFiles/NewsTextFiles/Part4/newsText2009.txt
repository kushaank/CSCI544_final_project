
KARACHI — A Pakistani court yesterday dismissed the case against an American FBI agent arrested for trying to board a plane while carrying ammunition, officials said.

The agent, identified by Pakistani officials as Joel Cox, was held at Karachi airport earlier this month when security staff found him carrying 15 rounds for a 9mm handgun during routine checks before a flight to the capital Islamabad.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation agent spent three days in custody before being released on $10,000 bail. The Washington Post has said he was on temporary assignment in Pakistan to help local authorities investigate corruption.

A district judge in Karachi, Hasan Ali Kalwar, quashed the case after police failed to present any evidence against the agent.

The judge said police had invoked the wrong section of the law.

“He was not carrying any weapon but was carrying only the bullets and magazines,” Kalwar was quoted as saying by a court official.

Police did not pursue the case after the interior ministry informed them that the agent was authorised to carry the ammunition, police officer Khalid Mehmood said.
