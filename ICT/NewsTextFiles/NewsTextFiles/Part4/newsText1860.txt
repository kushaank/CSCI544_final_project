
RAFAH: Aid convoys from Algeria and Jordan crossed yesterday from Egypt into Israeli-blockaded Gaza with $2.5m worth of supplies, the Palestinian territory’s Hamas government said.

Alaa Al Batta, a government official, told a news conference at the Rafah border crossing that a 14-member Algerian delegation brought medicines and medical equipment worth $2m for the opening of an Algerian-sponsored hospital in the southern Gaza town of Khan Yunis.

“We brought 253 kinds of medicine and 144 medical devices,” said Sheikh Yahya Sarri, leader of the Algerian team.

Kifah Al Amaryah, heading a Jordanian “Miles of Smiles” convoy, said his 20-strong team, delivering aid worth $0.5, would follow up on more than 100 aid projects and launch a new vocational training scheme, also in Khan Yunis.
