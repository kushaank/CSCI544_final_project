
QUEENSLAND Premier Campbell Newman says he did not know a company awarded a contract to run a juvenile bootcamp was a Coalition donor.

Mr Newman has been forced to defend the lucrative contract in parliament, after it emerged the chief executive of the winning company Beyond Billabong later donated money to the party.

When asked by Labor’s Bill Byrne whether he’d launch an inquiry, Mr Newman said the donation in question was to the federal party.

“The Attorney-General (Jarrod Bleijie) and I don’t have any knowledge what that was about,’’ Mr Newman told parliament.

Beyond Billabong was awarded the contract even though a departmental advisory panel recommended another company to run the Lincoln Springs bootcamp on a remote station two hours west of Ingham.

The panel said Beyond Billabong’s submission lacked information and proposed a price more than double that of its competitors.

Mr Bleijie has defended the contract, saying Beyond Billabong’s costs were higher because it was a super bootcamp, taking in juveniles from the Cairns and Townsville regions.

It could offer services other tenderers couldn’t, he said.

“Clearly the evaluation team got it wrong,’’ Mr Bleijie told Fairfax radio.

“We had to have someone with experience and ability to go out bush to run a bootcamp.

Mr Bleijie said he only became aware of the donation on Monday.

Beyond Billabong said the donation in question was made after the company’s chief executive Boyd Curran attended a dinner at which former prime minister John Howard was a guest speaker.

The insinuation that Mr Curran’s attendance at the event was in some way connected with the awarding of the contract was unfounded and incorrect, it said.
