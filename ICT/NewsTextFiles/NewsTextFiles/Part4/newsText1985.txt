Malaysian Airline System Bhd, which logged a second day of sharp decline in share price to hit a record low today, may continue to be in focus.

The fall today was mainly due to the prime minister’s comment that he was not ruling out bankruptcy as an option for the loss-making carrier.

The slide could add urgency to talk that the airline, which posted big quarterly loss after the disappearance of flight MH370, might need a financial rescue from state investor Khazanah Nasional Bhd, which owns 69 percent of the company.

Bankruptcy might be one of several options for the airline to restructure after years in the red, the Wall Street Journal reported Najib Razak as saying.
