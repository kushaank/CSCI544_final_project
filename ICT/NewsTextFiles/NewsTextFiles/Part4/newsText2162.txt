
A COW was pulled to safety by fire crews from across Hampshire after getting trapped in a bog in Southampton .

Specialist crews from Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service were sent to Gaters Mill nature reserve, Swaythling , at 5pm on Sunday after a 14-month old Aberdeen Angus-cross heifer got stuck in deep boggy mud.

Following a call from a farmer, animal rescue specialist Buster Brown was sent to the scene close to the River Itchen.

Crews from Overton, St Mary's and Lyndhurst freed the cow from the mud without it receiving any injuries.

Buster said: â€œIt's not uncommon for us to assist in such incidents and using prescribed methods approved by the veterinary industry, the cow was safely assisted to dry ground where it was returned back to its herd.

From reading the headline, I thought some old bint had got herself trapped in her toilet!

Glad they were finally able to mooooove the cow on.  A big pat on the back to the rescue service.

Presumably they moved it to an udder field.

They had to otherwise it would have been there for heifer.

At least it's warm out otherwise it could have been Friesian.

Should put a bell on it, doesn't look like the horns will work.

I thought all the public bogs in Southampton had been closed!

Pulled out for what though? Return to the farm to be slaughtered or repeatedly impregnated and milked? Wonderful!
