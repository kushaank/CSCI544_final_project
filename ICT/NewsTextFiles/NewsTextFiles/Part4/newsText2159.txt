
Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have been busy during their first full day in Canada, lunching with war brides and veterans, visiting a local farmers' market and making stops at the Halifax Public Gardens and a military family resource centre.

The Prince of Wales and Camilla spent lunch at the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21, where they chatted with veterans and war brides.

They also toured Halifax's Seaport Farmers’ Market, where Charles sampled Nova Scotia wine. The couple met with children from the Hope Blooms project, a venture where young people took over an abandoned Halifax garden and now make an organic salad dressing so popular they can't keep up with demand.

Camilla visited the Military Family Resource Centre and Alice Housing, an organization that supports women and children leaving domestic abuse.

Charles told the crowd the Royal Family is "always made to feel so much at home in Canada."

"Being with you here today, my wife and I have felt that Nova Scotians and Canadians are offering us what I can only describe as a thousand welcomes," he said.

Charles said he has many fond memories of Halifax, including one from 42 years ago when he visited as a member of the Royal Navy.

He noted Halifax's military history and the cenotaph in Grand Parade, which he said is a reminder of Canada’s involvement in two world wars "when Canadians sacrificed so much to protect their cherished freedoms."

"Halifax has borne witness to so much of Canada's modern history," he said.

The pair will travel to Pictou County later Monday for a tour of the  Hector Heritage Quay and Museum .

The royal couple arrived in Halifax on Sunday evening and was greeted at Halifax Stanfield International Airport by several dignitaries, including Central Nova MP and Justice Minister Peter MacKay, Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil and Halifax Mayor Mike Savage.
