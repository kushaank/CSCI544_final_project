
DOHA – A Bahraini activist has been killed in a mysterious explosion in capital Manama, local media and Bahrain's Al-Wefaq opposition bloc said Friday.

Local media reported that Ali Fasial al-Ekrawi, who is wanted by the Bahraini authorities, had been killed in an as-yet-unexplained explosion in the Sitra district in southern Manama.

Media reports failed, however, to say why al-Ekrawi was wanted by authorities.

Al-Wefaq, Bahrain's main opposition bloc, confirmed that al-Ekrawi had been killed in "a tragic and painful" incident, but gave no further details.

The Interior Ministry tweeted that an explosion had been heard in Sitra and that someone had been admitted to Salmaniya Hospital before being pronounced dead.

An investigation has been opened into the incident, the ministry added.

Bahrain has been rocked by political unrest since 2011. Authorities blame the Shiite Wefaq opposition group, which calls for the establishment of a "constitutional regime" in Bahrain, for the turmoil.

In recent months, the kingdom has seen sporadic attacks on security forces and several bombings carried out with homemade explosives and petrol bombs.
