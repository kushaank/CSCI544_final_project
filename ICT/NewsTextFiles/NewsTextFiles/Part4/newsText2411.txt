
Reigate and Redhill Choral Society (RRCS) have returned from a tour of Belgium which included performances at the National Basilica, Brussels, St George's Memorial Church, Ypres, and Brussels Cathedral.

The choir, who have toured and performed widely in Britain and abroad, were given what music director Peter Farrant called a “deeply moving” reception at their concerts.

He said: “Consistently popular with members, past performances have been staged at prestigious venues both in the UK and overseas, including leading venues in Paris, Lille, Brussels, Brugge, Rouen, Bristol, Bath, Antwerp and Christchurch, resulting in exhilarating performances and happy memories.

“This trip was no exception."
