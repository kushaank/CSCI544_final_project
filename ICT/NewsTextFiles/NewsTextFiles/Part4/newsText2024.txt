
Romania's leu opened a shade higher on Friday after ratings agency Standard & Poor's put the country back at investment grade, recognizing its improvement in cutting external debt.

S&P, which earlier on Friday raised its credit rating on Romania to 'BBB-/A3' from 'BB+/B', was the last of the three main agencies to upgrade the country, but as decision had largely been priced in, the impact on local markets was limited.

"Markets have recognized much earlier the solid rebalancing of the Romanian economy and, therefore, the decision is to a large extent already priced in," Romania's top lender BCR said in a research note.

"However ... relative valuations suggest that there is still some downside potential for the yields of Romanian sovereigns.

Romania's 5-year yield was unchanged from yesterday's close at 4.07 percent. But yields fell sharply after a debt tender on Thursday, as the entire central eastern European region was buoyed by higher-than-expected first-quarter growth figures.
