Intimate conversations on contemporary arts and issues.

Chris Gautz of Crain's Detroit Business explains the warring minimum wage bills, one of which was approved by Michigan state Senators yesterday. This bill, introduced by Senate Majority Leader Randy Richardville, would repeal the state's current minimum wage law of $7.40 and increase it to $9.20 by 2017.

It now moves on to the House for approval.

According to Gautz, the shift Republicans are trying to avoid is the increase tipped wage from $2.65 to $10.10. He says under current legislation, if a tipped employee does not make the minimum hourly wage of $7.40 with tips, the employer must make up the difference.
