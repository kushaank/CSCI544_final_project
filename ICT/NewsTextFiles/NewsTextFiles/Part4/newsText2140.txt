
FROM home-loan fiddling to viewing pornographic images of Britney Spears at work, a Nedbank manager’s "meteoric rise and shameful fall from grace" has been revealed in a recent court case.

With 26 years of banking experience as a branch manager for a top South African bank, Mark Solari had made it.

The manager of the Parow branch in Cape Town had duped the system into increasing his own home-loan amounts without following proper procedures. He also enjoyed viewing pornography on his work computer.

All was going swimmingly until he was caught in 2008. According to a recent Labour Appeal Court judgment, Solari collaborated with a colleague to approve and release unsecured loans from the bank without the necessary authorisation, "causing potential financial and reputational risk" to his employer.

He abused the company’s e-mail and internet policy when he "received, returned and forwarded" pornography, including of Ms Spears, on his work computer. About 1,000 such images were found on his computer, including "celebrity exposures and equine encounters".

He was charged, convicted and dismissed and, despite several attempts to challenge the ruling in the past six years, the bank has been vindicated by the recent ruling. Solari has, however, indicated that he is planning to take the matter to the Supreme Court of Appeal.

The judgment details how Solari collaborated with his colleague Jonathan Mitchell, a team leader at Nedbank’s home-loans department, to raise his three home loans by more than R850,000. Solari had three mortgages with the bank for three properties, with a total registered bond value of R725,000.

Through Mitchell’s user rights, over five years Solari drew down a further R853,507 from these bond accounts — without registering additional bonds as security.

By doing so, they bypassed banking procedures such a s the required risk assessment, property valuation and bond registration.

Mitchell was also fired after being found guilty of altering clients’ details — including Solari’s — to allow them to borrow more than their bond values.

The court rejected Solari’s defence that he did not know his actions were wrong. He claimed to trust Mitchell and "took it on his word" that all he had to do was e-mail Mitchell to increase his loans, with approval taking a mere 10 minutes.
