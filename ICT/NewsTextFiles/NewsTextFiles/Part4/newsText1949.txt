
The ANC Youth League will fight an application to have it provisionally sequestrated over the R4m debt it owes Gallagher Estate Convention Centre, a lawyer said yesterday.

“The ANC Youth League was given two weeks to file an opposing affidavit by the high court in Johannesburg after it indicated at the weekend that it would oppose our application,” Phillip Patlansky, for Gallagher, said.

Atterbell Investments, trading as Gallagher Estate, said the ANCYL owed it more than R4m for four events it held at the centre in June 2011.

In April this year it asked the court to place the ANCYL under final liquidation or provisionally sequestrate it.

According to an affidavit by the convention centre’s chief executive Adolf Venter, a default judgment was handed down on the matter in September 2011.

Patlansky said the ANCYL was ordered to file its opposing papers within 15 days, after which Gallagher Estate would have 10 days to file answering affidavits.

“The case was postponed without a date.

“Legal costs have been reserved,” he said.
