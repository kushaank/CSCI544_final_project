
Six government officials were assassinated and two civilians died as gunmen attacked the governor’s office on May 17 during a visit by Mara, the United Nations said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. At least 23 UN peacekeepers were injured, it said, while an unknown number of Malian soldiers were killed.

Gunmen are still holding hostages, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said yesterday. They’ve occupied government buildings, including the governor’s office, the UN said.

“It violates all the agreements that we had signed with these groups, which had acknowledged that Kidal is a Malian town,” Mara said in an interview with Radio France Internationale today.

Ethnic Touareg insurgents bolstered by fighters and weapons from Libya in 2012 began attacking the Malian army in northern towns including Kidal. After they declared independence in the north, they were pushed aside by rivals linked to al-Qeada seeking to impose Islamic law in the region.

In January last year, the Islamists retreated after French forces carried out airstrikes. The separatists were allowed to retain a stronghold in Kidal, which is a Touareg-dominated town, pending peace talks with the government.
