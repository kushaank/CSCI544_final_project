
Mick Jagger is a great-grandpa.

No word on whether Jagger looked at the tyke for the first time and said "Please allow me to introduce myself ..."

I know, that was a softball. C'mon, it's Monday.

Jagger's 21-year-old granddaughter Assisi Jackson gave birth to a baby girl over the weekend, according to the Daily Mail.

The baby is the first for Jackson and her 25-year-old boyfriend, chef Alex Key. They didn't announce the baby's name.

The Rolling Stones frontman has seven children with four women, and four grandchildren. Jackson is the daughter of Jagger's 42-year-old daughter, Jade Jagger, Mick's daughter by ex-wife Bianca Jagger.

"The women in our family just tend to have children young, it runs in the genes," Jackson told Hello! magazine.

Good to know that if there's a big flood, we can count on Mick Jagger to re-populate the planet.

It's been a year of serious highs and lows for Jagger, who has been touring the world with his band to celebrate its 50th anniversary. Jagger's girlfriend, 49-year-old fashion designer L'Wren Scott, committed suicide in March. The couple had been together since 2001.

"I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way," Jagger wrote on Facebook. "We spent many wonderful years together and had made a great life for ourselves."

Scott's death prompted the Stones to reschedule its Australian and New Zealand tour dates. The "14 On Fire" tour will resume May 26 in Oslo.
