
BINTULU: Members of Sarawak Teachers’ Union (STU) were urged to equip themselves with the latest information technology (IT) and other relevant skills and knowledge to keep abreast with the education system.

STU vice-president Datin Diana Tay Ai Ai said it would not be a problem for young teachers to adapt to change, but there might be some difficulty for senior teachers in their 50s to pick up new skills.

However she believed there was no excuse for teachers not to take up the challenge as the face of teaching had changed over the years due to the advent of IT.

“The challenges are also coming from students and parents and it’s not going to be an easy task. You have to learn IT,” she said during the STU Bintulu Division 11th annual general meeting cum presentation of academic awards to pupils at Li Hua Hotel yesterday. She said teachers must use IT knowledge to be exposed to issues that affect their profession.

“Education is a life-long journey – even our children are smarter than us and it is our duty to equip ourselves with the latest technologies and information,” she said.

Tay also called on all teachers in Sarawak to register with STU and urged STU Bintulu Division to disseminate info on the benefits of joining the union.

“With more members, we will be even stronger,” she said, adding that teachers should be proud of their profession as they lay the foundation for other professions.

STU divisional chairperson Soo Siew Huong said they had about 958 registered members as of May 2014, and were targeting 1,000 members by end of the year.

“Our task has been made challenging so we must be more creative and innovative in our teaching approach in line with global competitiveness,” she said.

Relevant courses and seminars for teachers must be continued as teachers need to upgrade their skills to succeed in their profession.
