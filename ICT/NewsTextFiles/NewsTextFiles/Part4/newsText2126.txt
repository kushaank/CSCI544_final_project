
Kenya is responsible for only seven per cent of the products that circulate the East African market. This means that Kenya only gets a seven per cent share of theÂ Â  $11 billion East African market. The rest — at least 90 per cent — goes to the foreign exporters.

If East Africa steps up its manufacturing, it might just follow the footsteps of countries like India, Germany and Japan. All those quality products that are made in Germany have made it to be the second largest manufacturing exporter in the world, behind China. It is no wonder that Germany is Europe’s strongest economy.

Manufacturing is, therefore, an extremely vital component of economic growth. However, for long term benefits to be realised, manufacturing must be infused with sustainability. Kenya must embrace the vibrant manufacturing that powered many developed economies but shun the unsustainable energy and practices that powered them. Green manufacturing ensures efficient energy usage, adequate utilisation of local resources, replenishment of raw materials, sufficient remuneration of human resource and ultimately, vibrant economic growth. We have a golden chance to integrate green manufacturing into various mega projects like the regional railway line.
