MANILA, Philippines â€” Groups of Filipino internet activists defaced 200 Chinese government and commercial websites to protest Beijing's increasing aggression in the disputed West Philippine Sea.

The hackers posted a message on the defaced websites that said: "China's alleged claim on maritime territories and oppressive poaching can no longer be tolerated. Stand against oppression! It's time to fight back! Say no to China's bullying!"

One of the hackers' group, Anonymous Philippines, claimed that their operation on Monday was a success. Some of the defaced websites are still inaccessible as of posting time.

Tensions increased recently after Philippine authorities arrested 11 Chinese poachers.

The Philippines also filed a protest against China's land reclamation and construction efforts in the Mabini Reef.

President Benigno Aquino III said yesterday that China has violated the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.
