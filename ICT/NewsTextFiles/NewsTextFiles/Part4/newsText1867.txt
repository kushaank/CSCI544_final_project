
She was only crowned Miss Universe Thailand on Saturday but Weluree "Fai" Ditsayabut has already become caught up in the political crisis engulfing her country, after comments were found on her Facebook page referring to pro- government demonstrators as "dirty," "evil activists" that should "all be  executed."

According to news site Khaosod English, the 22-year-old has often published scathing comments about the Red Shirt movement on her Facebook page, which now appears to have been deleted.

"I am not neutral. I am on the side of His Majesty the King," Weluree said in a comment from November, Khaosod English reported. "I'm so angry at these evil activists. They should all be executed."

Weluree - an actress, talk show host, and English student - apologized yesterday for the remarks in a television interview. "I was careless. I was young. I did it recklessly," she said. "It won't happen again."
