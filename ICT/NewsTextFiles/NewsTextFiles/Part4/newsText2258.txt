Grain handler Viterra has cut its haulage from two trains to one longer train, but has stated it was expecting to move similar volumes of grain by rail.

However the Port Lincoln City Council raised concerns that if the changes led to more grain being trucked into Port Lincoln by road, it would increase truck traffic and threaten road safety.

RDAWEP chief executive officer Dion Dorward said the board would meet with the stakeholders involved to assess the impact of any changes and consider how potential safety and traffic congestion issues could be addressed.

"This is a long-term challenge that does not have a simple solution due to the lack of alternative infrastructure and freight corridors," he said.

"Potential solutions will require commitment and genuine collaboration across a number of agencies and industry.

"I have an immense respect for the driving skill and patience of truck drivers, but our main roads urgently require the construction of overtaking lanes to help manage the traffic congestion caused by the increasing numbers of trucks, caravans and cars on our roads.

"This issue impacts on the health and safety of our citizens in addition to our environment and local economy."
