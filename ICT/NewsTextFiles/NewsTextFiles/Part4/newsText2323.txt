
The price of Brent crude has extended its gains from last week on concerns that production from Libya will be disrupted after an outbreak of violence in Tripoli over the weekend. Brent crude is currently trading at $110.11 a barrel after closing at $109.70 at the end of last week.

The Libyan capital remains tense this morning, a day after forces loyal to a renegade general stormed the countryâ€™s parliament and demanded its suspension.

The Libyan government has insisted that it remains in control of the country. It condemned yesterdayâ€™s attack in which two people are said to have died and more than 50 wounded, and vowed to carry on.

"This is the worst outbreak of militia-related violence for a while and a reversal of the relatively positive sentiment that we had from Libya earlier in the month," said Mark Keenan, head of commodities research in Asia at Societe Generale. "It's very likely that Libya is going to retain a strong geopolitical risk premium in oil markets going forward," he added.

Meanwhile, in further bullish news for the price of oil, The Telegraph has reported that China is Stockpiling oil for its strategic petroleum reserve at a record pace amid mounting tensions in the South China Sea, and the possibility of further sanctions against Russia over the crisis in Eastern Ukraine.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) revealed in its latest monthly report that China imported 6.81 million barrels a day in April, an all-time high despite the fact that Chinaâ€™s economy has been slowing for months, with a deteriorating steel industry and a sharp downturn in new construction. The agency estimated that 1.4 million barrels a day was channelled into Chinaâ€™s fast-expanding network of storage facilities, deeming it â€œan unprecedented buildâ€�.
