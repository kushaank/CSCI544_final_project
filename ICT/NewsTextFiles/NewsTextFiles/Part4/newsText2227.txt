
YEREVAN, MAY 19, ARMENPRESS. Armenia continues to maintain a leading position in the research field of high energies in the atmosphere, which tends to become "Armenian science", as the Department of Cosmic Rays of the Foundation of "A. Alikhanian National Science Laboratory" (Yerevan Physics Institute) has recorded more than 300 cases of detection of the elementary particle flux from thunderstorms. In addition, it is in our country that the biggest amount of the equipment for measuring the cosmic ray flux during thunderstorms is installed. This, in a conversation with “Armenpress”, was mentioned by the Director of the Yerevan Physics Institute, Professor Ashot Chilingaryan.

"In the field of atmospheric high energy physics one of our successes is that we have created a model of high-energy phenomena in thunderclouds, using the results derived from the Armenian network of geophysical parameters established by ourselves" - said the scientist.
