
EVEN if the platinum mining companies agreed to workers’ demand for a R12,500 monthly wage for entry-level employees and the strikers returned to work on Tuesday, it would not represent a permanent solution to the problems plaguing the industry. The reason is that the underlying issues that triggered the strike and have sustained it for so long have not been resolved.

It is generally accepted that the migrant labour system is a significant contributor to higher wage demands as workers battle to sustain themselves at work and their families back home. The 2008 global economic crisis, which destroyed more than 1-million jobs in South Africa, has also been a factor, along with long-standing structural unemployment, which affects about 36% of the population.

Many more working South Africans have more people to support now than they did a decade ago, eroding the buying power of their income. According to a recent publication by the South African Institute of International Affairs, the dependency ratio for mining jobs is 10:1, a staggering number for workers netting less than R100,000 a year.

Workers and their relatives are swimming in debt from both legitimate lenders and loan sharks. A downside of the delivery of formal housing to millions of poor people has been that they need to buy furniture and other big-ticket items for their homes, invariably on high-interest credit. So the pressure for higher wages was inevitable as they middle class grew in South Africa, and if the underlying structure does not change then that pressure will be sustained for the foreseeable future too.

On the other hand, industry analysts and some more outspoken investors have for many years been calling for the South African platinum industry to improve cost and operational efficiencies to boost their progressively eroding profitability. This would inevitably include retrenchments, a political swearword in a country with such high unemployment.

Then reality hit home. The year before last was a disaster for Anglo Platinum (Amplats), the world’s largest platinum producer with more than 50,000 employees. Production, sales, profit, headline earnings, cash flow and productivity all fell off the cliff, while costs escalated. The loss prompted the restructuring that analysts had long been calling for, at a time when its employees had never been under as much personal financial pressure.

Amplats’ competitors are not faring too well either. For the 12 months to June last year Impala Platinum reported a 23% drop in gross profit, net debt increased from R2.7bn to R4.3bn and it paid no dividend. Just a few weeks ago Lonmin reported losses for the six months to March, partly influenced by the strike.

In the light of these realities the question has to be asked whether it is prudent to continue relying on the traditional wage formula alone to respond to a crisis. Creative solutions driven by credible, visionary leadership are long overdue. That the platinum price has not responded to such a long period of strike action should also send a strong signal about the state of the global platinum market. It is depressed and has been for some time.

The critical missing ingredient is decisive, credible leadership on the part of the government, mining companies and unions. Mining companies need to acknowledge publicly that many of their employees are struggling to make ends meet, and commit to working with them to find a solution that does not entail unsustainably large wage increases.

The government should also lead an urgent, comprehensive reorientation of the Mining Charter to focus primarily on ensuring direct socioeconomic benefits to the families of migrant workers.

This should be done to alleviate the pressures workers are under, but also to protect the integrity of the labour relations system, which was never conceived or structured to deal with wider socioeconomic and structural defects.

That should create the environment in which Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union president Joseph Mathunjwa would be able to persuade union members that R12,500 a month is not the holy grail.

Not only is the amount unsustainable in the short term, it would destroy jobs and result in even greater suffering for the families of workers.

The volatility in the platinum sector has now carried on for almost two years, which is likely to prompt industrial users to intensify research aimed at securing substitutes for platinum, some of which already exist and are becoming economic. That would reduce these industrial users’ exposure to South Africa’s uncertainty and, tragically, further erode the earning potential and economic contribution of the country’s platinum sector.

All of the stakeholders in the mining industry need to think outside the box to come up with a lasting solution to these structural issues, or the travails of the platinum sector are likely to be repeated elsewhere in the economy.
