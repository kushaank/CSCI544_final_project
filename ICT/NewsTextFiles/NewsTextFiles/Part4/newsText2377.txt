
The inquest into the killing of police informer Terence Hodson and his wife Christine has been adjourned at the request of former drug squad detective Paul Dale.

The couple were shot dead at their Kew home, in Melbourne's inner-east, almost 10 years ago.

Their deaths occurred shortly before Hodson was due to give evidence in court against Mr Dale.

Mr Dale and hit-man Rodney Collins, who is in prison, were later charged over the shootings, but the case against them was dropped after gangland boss Carl Williams was murdered in prison in 2010.

The five-day inquest was due to start this morning but has been adjourned until Friday.

The inquest heard briefly from Mr Collins' lawyer, who told the court his client was seeking to be excused from giving evidence.

No decision has been made on the request.

The Hodsons' daughters have long been campaigning for an inquest into their parents' deaths, and their calls were answered in November last year.

At the time it was announced, Victorian coroner Ian Gray said there was intense public interest in the case.

He said as well as considering who murdered the Hodsons, the inquest would also investigate the level of protection afforded to the couple before their death.

Police have publicly cleared Mr Dale over the killings but have said he remains a person of interest.
