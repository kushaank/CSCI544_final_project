
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority wants a proposed wireless broadband tower near Bathurst to be registered due to its proximity to the local airport.

NBN wants to build the 40m tower south of Bathurst to increase coverage to the Yarras and Glanmire areas.

The airport's obstacle limitation map's height limit will be exceeded by 25m, however a report to the Bathurst Regional Council says the potential breach ''triggers consideration of the impact on air safety''.

The development has been referred to CASA twice and the authority has not responded except to issue a circular to ensure tall structures are reported and registered.

The council is expected to approve the tower at its meeting on Wednesday.
