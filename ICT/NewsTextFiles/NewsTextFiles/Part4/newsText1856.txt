
A BUNGLING thief set his own hair alight while trying to steal an electrical cable in Manama, a court heard.

The Bangladeshi man suffered second-degree burns to his hands and head after trying to cut through cabling at a building in the capital in December.

Passers-by alerted police when the 32-year-old was spotted ducking into a vehicle with his hair engulfed in flames.

He was taken to Salmaniya Medical Complex by the driver of the car, where it was claimed he suffered the burns while cooking.

However, police found wire cutters and tools in the defendants' possession that were apparently used by him during the attempted theft.

The incompetent thief's friend told prosecutors that he had picked the injured man up in his car after receiving a phone call.

"My friend called me and said that he got electrocuted when he was stealing electrical cables," he said.

"I picked him up and his face was burnt and he was in a bad state. His hands and head were burnt from the electrocution.

"We then took him to SMC, where we told doctors that he suffered  burns while cooking."

The Bangladeshi was earlier jailed for 12 months by the Lower Criminal Court for attempted theft.

An appeal lodged at the High Criminal Appeals Court was rejected yesterday and he will be deported after completing his sentence.
