The Redlands Branch of Cancer Council Queensland is again joining with The Courthouse restaurant to host an Australia's Biggest Morning Tea on Thursday, May 22 for 9.30am start at a cost of $30 payable at the door.

The theme is "All Dolled Up" and ladies will enjoy dressing to the nines. With the sub-theme of dolls, guests are welcome to bring a doll, maybe old, new, hand-made or family heirloom to show in the parade of dolls. The guest speaker will be Redland Museum president Ross Bower, who will talk about the new Toy Hall of Fame.

Redlands Cancer Council secretary Pam Tranter said the Australia's Biggest Morning Tea was one of Cancer Council's foremost fundraising events, which each year raised over $2.5 million in Queensland, by more than 6700 morning tea hosts. Nationally, Australia's Biggest Morning Tea has raised more than $110 million for the fight against cancer in the past two decades.
