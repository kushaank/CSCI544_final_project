The search for Bibb County School's next superintendent is on again.

At a Board meeting last night, Bibb School Board members announced they were closing their current search for a superintendent and re-opening a new one.

When the board received applications during the old search, Bill Sampson of the Georgia School Boards Association, advised them to make a quick decision.

Bill Sampson said one of the main reasons he believes the board re-opened the search was because some of the candidates didn't have experience as superintendents.

"I think they maybe want to review and change their qualifications. I think they feel if they do that, there will be some potential candidates that did not apply that will decide to apply," Sampson said.

While Sampson said he can't speak for the board, he says changing some of the qualifications from required to preferred can help find additional candidates.

We tried to reach out to several board members today...who deferred to Lynn Farmer.

Last night, Farmer told us that at least some of the original candidates had found other positions.

She said that was part of the reason for going back to the drawing board.

Farmer also said there are some applicants in the pool from the old search that caught the board's eye. They will have to reapply.

Sampson also said an average search for a superintendent takes around 3 months, and while a 15 month-long search isn't average, he said it isn't unusual.
