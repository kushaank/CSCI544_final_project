
Malaysian Defense Minister and acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said Monday that Malaysia would discuss with Inmarsat on the release of the "raw data" demanded by the families of those on board the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.

"In light of the recent demands by the next of kin (NOK) for the Inmarsat 'raw data,' I have instructed the Malaysian Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) to discuss with Inmarsat on the release of the aforementioned data for public consumption," he said in a press statement.

Hishammuddin said this was consistent with their stand for greater transparency and prioritizing the interests of the family members of those on board the missing plane.

Moreover, the minister said a team of hydrographic experts from Malaysia, China and Australia met over the weekend. They agreed that an extensive bathymetric survey of the areas provided by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau would be carried out in the Southern Indian Ocean, he added.

Hishammuddin said the survey would be conducted by the Chinese survey ship Zhu Kezhen, which was scheduled to sail for the survey area on Wednesday if weather permits.

At the same time, a team of technical experts had met in Canberra to discuss and refine the satellite data, calculations and analysis from Inmarsat, he said.
