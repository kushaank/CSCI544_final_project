The Trapps are a pub rock band orginally formed in the late seventies and later reformed by founding members Brett Godwin and Kevin Ballard. The current lineup brings their high school mate Rob Godwin back to the band and adds local leading musicians David Gollan and Ben Lambert to the mix.

The name comes from the saying of "playing round the traps," in reference to the number of pub venues that bands used to play around in their gig circuit.

In the eighties The Trapps played a mixture of original and current covers and supported most of Australia's top bands that stopped at Taree on their way north to the Gold Coast. Some of which were Cold Chisel, INXS, The Saints, Jo Jo Zep and the Falcons, Mental as Anything, and Divinyls.

The Trapps in early 2013 were chosen as Mid North Coast finalists in the ABC radio Exhumed competition, making it to the final six bands for the region. The gig at Bellingen was filmed on ABC TV and all six shortlisted acts featured on ABC Mid North Coast mornings before the Exhumed gig.

The Trapps song list is a who was who of the 70's and 80's; David Bowie, Tom Petty, The Kinks, Van Halen, Rolling Stones, Stevie Ray Vaughan, The Angels, AC/DC, Deep Purple, Thin Lizzy and more.

Catch the Trapps at the Australian Hotel on Friday night to relive the best years of pub rock in Australia. From 8.30pm-11.30pm, free entry.
