
CEBU, Philippines - Naga City Mayor Valdemar Chiong lauded city police chief Superintentent Brindo Nacario and his seven police officers for taking an active role in the fight against illegal drugs in the city.

During the flag-raising ceremony yesterday morning, Chiong personally handed P15,000 cash reward to Nacario for a job well-done over the arrest of three drug suspects in two separate operations last month.

Along with Nacario were Police Officers 2 Nilo Dacles, Orland Condes and Junarie Latorre and Police Officers 1 John Mark Bongo, Bobby Jay Basabe and Raymund Romarez and Wilfredo Pada Jr.

The police were able to arrest Wilfredo Geraldizo and Catalino Baricuatro who were reportedly caught red-handed having a pot session in Barangay Colon last April 18 and a certain Edgardo C. Pardillo for allegedly sniffing shabu in Barangay Tinaan.

"I am hoping that this will be sustained without let-up to achieve our vision of a drug-free City of Naga," Chiong said, adding that he is giving out a cash award of P5,000 to the PNP for every arrested drug user and P10,000 for an arrested illegal drug peddler.

"This will serve as a strong warning to the public that we really mean business to get rid of drug peddlers, users and all undesirable elements who are involved in the illegal drug trade in our city," the mayor said.

Â He added, "We should not let our guard down because I always think the drug problem is alarming."
