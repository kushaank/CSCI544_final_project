We did enjoy to talk with a very nice couple from Sydney which helped to pass the time happily. We had checked our bags in at the railway station thinking this would speed up our check in process. Wrong. Had to line up as per usual, but it was nice to have no luggage to manage for a while.Our cabin is great and it is lovely to have a balcony.

There is nothing like cruise traveling.  No luggage worries, no food worries, no travel worries... and the list goes on.  Enjoy it while you can!  Just watch all that food disappear... Ha!    Nice balcony!
