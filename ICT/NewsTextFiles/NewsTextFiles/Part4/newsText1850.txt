
The Centre for the Administration of Peace and Order (CAPO) yesterday summoned Deputy Senate Speaker Surachai Liangboonlertchai - the acting Senate Speaker - to answer a complaint and questions about whether he supports Suthep Thaugsuban, leader of the People's Democratic Reform Committee.

Suthep, who is trying to topple the caretaker government, is facing a charge of insurrection.

CAPO member Tarith Pengdit, who is also chief of the Department of Special Investigation, said he had signed the summons against Surachai based on the suspicion that he was attempting to have an unelected prime minister put place under an interpretation of Article 7 of the Constitution.

Surachai has been ordered to report  tomorrow at 2pm.
