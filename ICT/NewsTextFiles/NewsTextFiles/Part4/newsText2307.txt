
A NEW and delicious treat, described by its creator as an Aussie bush doughnut, is on the menu as a must-try for attendees of the Fraser Coast Show.

The doughnuts were created by Hervey Bay mother Kathryn Miller after she was craving a sweet treat while camping.

She guards the recipe closely - and for good reason.

"It's that easy, someone else will do it," she said.

The only secrets she gave was that they can be made while camping and there was plenty of opportunity for new flavours.

"I'm actually experimenting with peanut butter and jam," she said.

"We tried some of them - and they're absolutely beautiful."

Ms Miller had only started cooking the doughnuts one year ago, and only started selling them two months ago.

She said they're more affordable than a doughnuts bought from a shop - and they're getting more and more popular.

"They always turn out better than the real thing," she said.

"If you go to a doughnut shop you'll pay $3.20 for a jam doughnut."

She said people were lined up to buy them at the Pier Markets last weekend.

And Fraser Coast showgoers will be able to buy the doughnuts at the show on Thursday and Friday for $1.50 each.

An instant hit at the Pier Markets, Kathryn and Leigh Miller sell their jam filled, Aussie Bush Donuts for $1.50 or three for $4.00. You can try one for yourself at the Fraser Coast Show.
