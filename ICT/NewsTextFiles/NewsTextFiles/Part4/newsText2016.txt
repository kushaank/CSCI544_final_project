
LINGAYEN, Philippines  – The founding chairman of Biskeg na Pangasinan (Strength of Pangasinan) provincial political party yesterday urged warring elected officials in the province to stop politicking and mudslinging, noting it deprives the people of the services they deserve.

Secretary Antonio Villar Jr., chairman of the Dangerous Drugs Board, told The STAR that politicians should stop sowing intrigues as it only creates divisiveness.

“It’s not good for them, it is not good for the people, it is not good for the province,” Villar, who is considered as a political godfather in Pangasinan, said.

“Their resignation was only board member (Alfonso Bince Jr.’s) idea. But I, myself, am not in favor of what they did,” he added, referring to the reported resignation of five provincial board members from the Nationalist People Coalition (NPC).

He said the resignation letter created a crack in the party, as political leaders close to both the camps of Gov. Amado Espino Jr. and former fifth district congressman Mark Cojuangco are now divided.

“Instead of working harmoniously, they are creating an unhealthy environment for political leaders due to intrigues caused by the factions. This is not a good sign if we are really for the greater welfare of the people,” Villar said.

He said he had talked to Espino who assured him that he had no hand in the resignation of five board members from the NPC last week.

Espino, an NPC member, told local journalists he was not aware of the resignation move.

Villar had turned over to Espino the leadership of the Biskeg na Pangasinan, which he now serves as chairman emeritus.
