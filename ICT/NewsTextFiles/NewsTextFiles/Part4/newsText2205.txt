
Dubai-based classifieds website dubizzle has launched a new authentication process to cut down on the exploits of rogue agents.

The website, which is the leading source for online classified in the Middle East and North Africa, has started the initiative to prevent dodgy agents taking advantage of the high demand for UAE property.

Dubai-based agents already have to provide a Real Estate Regulatory Agency (RERA) ID before submitting a listing to dubizzle, but similar measures could not previously be imposed on agents operating outside the emirate.

Now agents must upload a copy of their employment visa or labour card, along with a trade license copy. The agents will then be able to use the site until the expiry date on the documents.

Dubizzleâ€™s move is another step in the right direction for the Dubai property industry, who have been making moves to improve security for consumers. Last summer RERA ordered all property brokerage firms to register all their available properties on the Simsari multiple listing service.

Since then, the government has introduced more regulation into the real estate market.
