
YANGON — A Chinese company says two workers have been kidnapped from a Myanmar copper mine by activists demanding the project be cancelled.

The Wanbao Mining company released a statement today (May 19) condemning what it called an “unprovoked act”.

It says a group called “Student Activists from Mandalay” abducted the men yesterday.

The Letpadaung mine is a joint venture between a Myanmar military-controlled holding company and China’s Wanbao Mining. It was the scene of violent clashes between police and protesters in 2012.
