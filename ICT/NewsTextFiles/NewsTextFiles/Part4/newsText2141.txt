
Johannesburg - Convicted Johannesburg drug dealer Frank Nabolisa has been sentenced to another 20 years' imprisonment, the Hawks said on Monday.

“Nabolisa is currently serving a 12-year imprisonment sentence with another drug dealer Sheryl Cwele in a separate case,” said Hawks spokesman Captain Paul Ramaloko.

He said Nabolisa appeared in the Wynberg Regional Court for sentencing on Monday, after he was found guilty on other drug-related offences earlier this year.

Nabolisa, 46, was charged with dealing in dangerous dependence-producing drugs, and contravening the Medicine and Related Substances Act on December 3, 2009.

At the time he was caught in possession of 2.4kg of cocaine, 5.8kg of paracetamol and 2.7kg of Hexamine at one of his drug storage facilities in Ivory Park, Johannesburg.

Nabolisa was jailed for 20 years for dealing in drugs and 10 years for contravening the Medicine and Related Substances Act.

Ramaloko said the convicted drug dealer would serve the latest sentences concurrently, after serving his 12-year sentence.
