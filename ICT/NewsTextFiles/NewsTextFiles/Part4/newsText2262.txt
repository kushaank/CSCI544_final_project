THE Australian Hearing bus is stopping by Kandos on Friday to offer free hearing checks and raise hearing health awareness.

The mobile hearing service has provided over 28,000 free hearing checks in the communities across Australia since it first launched in 2009.

No destination is too far-flung or offbeat.

On the Australian Hearing Bus will be Stuart, who has been with Australian Hearing for 15 years as a hearing aid technician.

Manager at Australian Hearing Dubbo Debbi Amos said as age-related hearing loss developed gradually over time it was common for people to not be aware their hearing is diminishing.

Hearing loss is a prevalent issue in the community, with around 60 per cent of Australians over 60 suffering from some form of hearing loss.

“A hearing check is a quick and easy way to measure the sounds you can and can’t hear.

As well as having a hearing check, visitors to the bus can find information on a range of common hearing issues and view a display of easy-to-use hearing devices for around the home.

This includes headsets for watching the TV and alert systems for doorbells.

“Not everyone who is experiencing problems hearing needs a hearing aid.

No appointment is necessary.

Australian Hearing will provide hearing checks to any interested adults who visit the bus on the day.
