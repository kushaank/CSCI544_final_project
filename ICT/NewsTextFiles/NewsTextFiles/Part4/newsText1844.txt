
A serial conwoman, who used the police to warn off a journalist who was  investigating her fraud, was jailed yesterday for 30 months.

Neelam Desai, 33, admitted to a string of frauds totalling more than £230,000,  including setting up a bogus travel agency as part of a “Ponzi” scheme which  left one victim more than £150,000 out of pocket.

She was also suspected of setting up a fake dating website which was being  investigated by Gareth Davies, 29, a senior reporter with the Croydon  Advertiser.
