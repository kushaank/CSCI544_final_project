
VENTURES AFRICA – Bahrain-based Al Baraka Banking Group has been in talks with South African authorities about launching Islamic bonds in the southern-most tip of the African continent, it emerged on Monday.

“We will try to do it as a subordinated, to raise capital adequacy ratios,” Yousif told Reuters.

The Islamic bank has businesses in 15 countries throughout the Middle East, Africa and Asia. These include South Africa and Pakistan, where it also plans to launch Islamic bonds.

According to Reuters, Islamic lenders get their money from retail deposits and short-term syndicated Islamic advances.

However, subordinated transactions are more and more being utilised, as Basel III international banking criteria are phased-in throughout the world, Reuters reported.

Al Baraka has the majority of its operations outside the Gulf and Southeast Asia. In South Africa, the lender runs seven retail outlets, making it the only complete Islamic bank in a country whose banks face a daunting problem of the ever-increasing non-performing loans (NPLs).
