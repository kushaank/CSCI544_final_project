
Robert Thwala, Swaziland’s Ministry of Agriculture Principal Secretary, said on Monday that agricultural inputs must be made affordable and accessible so as to increase production. Mr. Thwala told reporters that this was discussed at the African Union (AU) joint conference of ministers of agriculture, rural development, fisheries and aquaculture in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

He said the meeting noted that increased agricultural productivity was a priority in sustaining the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) momentum in Africa and member states.

The minister reminded his compatriots that in Africa, the increase in production noticed in the past ten years was due to expansion on land rather than an increase in yield per unit area.

He said this must be reversed.

He said sound policies and institutions must be provided so as to facilitate necessary reforms to secure access to land, water and other resources.

â€œThe resolute and intended shifting from subsistence agriculture to market-oriented agri-food systems and moving up the value-chain ladder is vital for agricultural transformationâ€�, he added.
