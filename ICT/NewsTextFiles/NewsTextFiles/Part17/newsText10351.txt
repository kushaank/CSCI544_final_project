
A coroner's inquest into the death of a man in a workplace accident at West Macgregor almost three years ago has been suspended because charges could be laid over the incident.

Just before Christmas 2011, Wayne Vickery, 45, was crushed under a grader which reversed at a construction site in Canberra's north.

Today chief coroner Lorraine Walker heard from counsel assisting, the driver of the grader did not stop and check where Mr Vickery was before reversing the machine.

She was also told that the employer on the site, Canberra Constructions, did not have side mirrors on the grader and left workers on the site to their own devices with little oversight.

The coroner halted the inquest because of the a reasonable belief that the company has been criminally negligent.

The grader driver could face charges of culpable driving causing death.

Wayne Vickery's wife Fiona says she is frustrated with today's court outcome.

"I want it over with," she said.

"I want if there is going to be a prosecution I'm sure everybody involved wants to, wants that over as well.

The inquest will resume in August if no charges are laid.
