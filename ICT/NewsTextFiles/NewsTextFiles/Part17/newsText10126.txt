Dubai Film and TV Commission (DFTC) has released the first ‘Film Dubai Production Guide’ ­ a comprehensive resource listing information about locations, talent and advice on filming and producing in Dubai. DFTC has launched the guide at Cannes Film Festival, one of the most prestigious events on the film calendar, where it is participating with other UAE film industry entities to showcase what the UAE has to offer international filmmakers.

The directory is the first guide of its type in the emirate and forms part of DFTC’s ongoing strategy to simplify and streamline film and TV production in the emirate. It will act as a one-stop resource for information about filming in Dubai, connecting professionals from across every aspect of the production process.

The guide contains in-depth information on all aspects of filming in Dubai including permissions required, licensing and location details, as well as information to help production companies source talent such as locally-based freelancers, technicians, and location scouts.  The guide will be distributed across DFTC’s network of film professionals and industry stakeholders.

Dubai has seen over 7,000 productions filmed in the emirate across a variety of genres and from all corners of the globe. In 2013, DFTC facilitated productions including two major Bollywood blockbusters, Happy New Year and Welcome Back, several Arabic TV series, and episodes of MasterChef Australia. DFTC continues to attract international productions to Dubai in 2014, including the world famous Bold and the Beautiful series, the German production, Cruise Into Happiness and MasterChef Arabia.
