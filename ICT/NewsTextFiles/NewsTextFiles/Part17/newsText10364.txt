BUDGET: Mayor Sam Johnson has spoken out about government's decision to cut the Local Roads Supplementary Funding Program.

Port Augusta mayor Sam Johnson has labelled the cuts to supplementary road funding as detrimental to Port Augusta and South Australia.

The federal government made the announcement to drop the Local Roads Supplementary Funding Program during last week’s budget.

“They have just ripped the best part of $18 million worth of funding clean out of the state and the people who will end up paying for this are rate payers,” he said.

Previously, Port Augusta relied on a four-yearly top up of $131,159 in supplementary funding, money that will no longer be available.

“The roads still need improving, we can make the decision, we can’t do it because we can’t afford to do it,” he said.

The funding contributed to Port Augusta’s major road reseal program, with every road identified when it has been worked on last, what needs to be done, condition and age of the road.

“We like to maintain that, we have seen other cities where they haven’t been as proactive in doing that, creating major issues down the track,” he said.

“Any contribution we can get towards that always helps, it might be ok for them to say it is only $130,000 but when you divide that by 5,200 rate payers and that is effectively what will happen.

By cutting this funding, the government is funneling the cost down to state and local government, making the federal government and their budget look good but puts the pressure back through other tiers of government.

“We may have needed to cut a few things to get the budget down but did you need to do it this severe, I don’t think so,” he said.
