
The Democratic Alliance (DA) on Monday called on public protector Thuli Madonsela to investigate President Jacob Zuma’s alleged abuse of power to enrich his nephew.

On Friday, the Mail & Guardian reported  that Zuma allegedly helped clinch a $2-million (R13-million then) investment for his nephew’s controversial mining company, Aurora Empowerment Systems.

According to the M&G, the claim by a director of international investment firm Global Emerging Markets (Gem) suggests that Zuma involved himself personally – despite having a clear conflict of interest given that his nephew was a director of Aurora.

The Gem director’s claim is buttressed by circumstantial evidence.

To make matters worse, Gem was led to pay the money into what appears to be a dummy account from which, according to a high court claim it filed, the cash was diverted.

There is no evidence the president or Khulubuse were involved in the claimed misappropriation.
