
A leading US investment banker is warning of the risks to 'stranded assets' posed by climate change.

Bob Litterman was Vice President of Research at the US Federal Reserve before working for 23 years at the big US investment bank Goldman Sachs, including during the Global Financial Crisis.

Litterman is in Australia talking to superannuation funds and investor groups.

He says no country wants to act alone on climate change but he predicts the world will soon see more political commitment.
