
YEREVAN. – Armenian parliament approved the bill on special investigation committee by 88 votes for, 32- against and one abstention.

The bill provides for merging investigating authorities of the Defense Ministry and Police.

According to the government plan, in the future the Special Committee will be joined by investigating authorities of other agencies, most likely the State Revenue Committee. The candidacy of former Attorney General Aghvan Hovsepyan is rumored for the post of the head of special committee.

Opposition is categorically against the bill: MP Nikol Pashinyan called it  “employment project for young retiree Aghvan Hovsepyan”.
