
The Abbott government has dismissed  concerns that money to fund refugee settlements in Cambodia could  end up in the pockets of corrupt officials.

Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen used Facebook on Monday  to confirm his nation's commitment to a deal, announcing the  country will sign a memorandum of understanding.

His post supports declarations by secretary of state in the  foreign ministry, Ouch Borith, that an agreement could be signed  within weeks.

But Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy warns money paid to  the country to resettle refugees will end up in the pockets of high  ranking government officials.

'Resettling refuges in the poor countries like Cambodia is not  the answer,' he told ABC radio.

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison dismissed those claims,  saying Australia has the experience and resources to ensure  appropriate resettlement of refugees in a poorer nation.

'We're not in the business of lining the pockets of officials,'  he told ABC radio.

Mr Morrison said talks about an agreement were positive but  there was still 'some distance to travel'.

Specific details about the agreement, including cost to the  Australian government, have not been worked out yet, he said.

Cambodia will take refugees from Nauru, but the resettlement  process is voluntary meaning a refugee can refuse to go to  Cambodia.

However, Mr Morrison's message is that there'll never be a spot  in Australia.

'It's about freedom from persecution, it's not about a ticket to  a first classed economy,' he said.

He said if a person protests resettlement in Cambodia it raises  questions about their claim.
