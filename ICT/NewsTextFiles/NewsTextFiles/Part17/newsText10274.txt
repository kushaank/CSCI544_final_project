
IN times when most businesses are doing it tough, not too many can say their sales are up by 40%.

But after only six months in the driver's seat at DC Motors in Rockhampton, dealer principal Peter Scherer can say just that.

By making the job more enjoyable for his staff, simplifying things and giving them more ability to satisfy customers, Peter said there has been a flow-on effect that has given great sales results in all areas of the business.

"The culture has changed," Peter said.

"We are doing better deals, people are returning to us."

Hyundai sales numbers have risen significantly, with the dealership now No.1 in Australia in the group ranking, making them on track to be an Australian platinum dealer.

Peter said Subaru and Mercedes Benz sales have doubled, and Jeep sales have also risen 40%.

He said they were one of only a handful of Nissan dealers to have reached monthly targets too.

"Clients can have the confidence to buy local from people who care."

Peter said he is was proud of his staff, following on from positive feedback they had received for sales, service and parts.

Steady growth in sales means a growth in staffing is needed.

Peter will be advertising soon to fill new roles within the company, including an assistant parts manager, sales manager and car cleaner.

He will also be looking at apprenticeships.

Peter said his family was loving life in Rockhampton after relocating from Adelaide, and were excited to be moving into their new home.

"We had to buy a Queenslander," he said.
