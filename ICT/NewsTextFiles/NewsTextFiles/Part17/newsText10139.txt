
Bahraini government forces have intensified crackdown on protests, clashing with mourners after the funeral of an anti-government protester on the island of Sitra.

According to reports on Sunday, at least one person suffered injuries after Bahraini forces fired tear gas to disperse the mourners.

The mourners reportedly urged Manama to probe the cause of the death of Ali Faisal Al Akrawi.

Akrawi was killed in a blast near his home on Friday. He is believed to have been in hiding following an absentia prison sentence of ten years for his alleged role in protests against the Al Khalifa rulers.

On March 14, 2011, troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates invaded the country to assist the Bahraini government in its crackdown on demonstrators.
