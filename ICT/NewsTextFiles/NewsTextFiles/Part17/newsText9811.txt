
South Africa’s largest mobile operator, Vodacom SA, today announced it is acquiring 100% of Neotel Proprietary Limited.

The country’s second-largest fixed telecommunications operator, Neotel competes with the likes of state-owned enterprise Telkom. Some of Neotel’s services include value-added voice, internet and data services for both business and retail customers via its Next Generation IP Network.

This transaction comes after Vodacom told its shareholders in September 2013 that it had entered into an agreement with Neotel.

The transaction will be a “cash consideration equivalent to an enterprise value” of R7 billion, says the group. And this would include Vodacom obtaining all of Neotel’s issued share capital and shareholder loan claims against the cellphone company.

Vodacom says the acquisition will be funded through “available cash resources and existing credit facilities”, but there are some conditions that need to be fulfilled in this transaction.

“Vodacom’s customer base will benefit from Neotel’s extensive fibre assets and enterprise capabilities which will allow Vodacom to accelerate its fixed enterprise strategy and stimulate greater competition in the South African fixed telecommunications sector,” said Vodacom.

The group says the combination of Vodacom and Neotel will result in an expansion of their product range and enhance their customer choice.

“Neotel continues to grow in the South African market and with this, when approved, will enable a greater choice of product and services for our customers and increased competition, while Neotel continues to deliver improved services and grows its customer base,” adds Joshi.

“The transaction is expected to close before the end of the current financial year, although will be dependent of the timing of the requisite regulatory approvals,” said Vodacom.
