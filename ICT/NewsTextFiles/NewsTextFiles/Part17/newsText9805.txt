
PRIVATE hospital group Netcare reported on Monday that its adjusted headline earnings per share for the six months ended March 2014 increased 19.5% to 75.9c.

Netcare declared an interim dividend of 32c per share, up 18.5% from the year-earlier period.

The company said its group revenue grew 17.3% to R15.411bn, while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation increased by 17.2% to R3.248bn. It said the group generated an increase in cash from operations of 40.5% to R2.609bn.

On the outlook for its divisions, Netcare said it expected the demand for private healthcare within South Africa to remain strong.

"The business will continue to drive clinical excellence and maintain its operational efficiency programmes. It will continue work on improving occupancies, along with the focused expansion of Netcare’s facilities and geographic footprint and leverage the opportunity for environmental upgrades in the process," Netcare said.

On its division in the UK, it said economic data indicated that the economy there was beginning to recover.

"We are confident that the private medical insurance market will strengthen in the medium term. With the distractions of the competition commission investigation out of the way and certain marginal sites exited, management will direct their focus on building caseload and complexity, while maintaining tight control of costs. We remain optimistic about the medium and longer-term prospects of the UK business," Netcare said.
