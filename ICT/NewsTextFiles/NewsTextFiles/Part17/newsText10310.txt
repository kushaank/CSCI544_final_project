
A SERVING Adelaide police officer has been ordered to stand trial, accused of abusing her power to obtain benefits for herself and others.

Senior Constable Amanda Boughen, 40, of Mawson Lakes, appeared in the Adelaide Magistrates Court today.

Boughen, who is suspended on full pay, pleaded not guilty to one count of being a public officer who exercised her power or influence to secure a benefit.

She also pleaded not guilty to one count of attempting to obstruct or pervert the course of justice.

Court documents allege both offences occurred at Ingle Farm on May 6, 2010 — however, the documents contain no further particulars about Boughen’s alleged offending.

Constantly-shifting levels of secrecy have surrounded the case , owing to suppression orders being placed on the matter after widespread reporting by the media.

Previously, The Advertiser has revealed Boughen is the former partner of Storm Alexander Strang — the alleged ringleader in the $40 million cannabis trafficking syndicate.

Strang, 41, is among 16 people charged over a drug ring allegedly running between Adelaide, Queensland and WA.

At the time of his arrest, police seized $200,000 in cash, 10kg of packaged cannabis, 171 plants, 56g of cocaine and a quantity of steroids.

Investigations have revealed Boughen’s property portfolio includes three Mawson Lakes homes and a city townhouse — until last month, she drove a silver Porsche Cayenne four-wheel drive.

They have also revealed Boughen was among a group of police cadets and instructors disciplined in 1998 following a party at a SA Police complex at Echunga.

Today, Magistrate Bob Harrap remanded Boughen on continuing bail to face the District Court next month.
