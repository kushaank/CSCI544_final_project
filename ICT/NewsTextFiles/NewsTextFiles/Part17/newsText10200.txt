
Argentine Vice-president Amado Boudou said he was not planning “an absence of leave” from office because that is not the style of President Cristina Fernandez' administration following a federal court confirmation of a criminal investigation into his alleged involvement in the sale of a minting company.

It never crossed my mind to ask for an absence of leave. First, because I'm convinced of what I'm saying and doing. I have a job to accomplish and I perform my duties every day, said Boudou on Sunday in a government sponsored television program.

”Besides, if they are after my head, I'm not giving up. Our leader (Cristina Fernandez) has undergone several health episodes and government did not move one inch. This has been the style of this government and if they think (the opposition) that the vice-president is a weakling they are wrong”.

Calls for Boudou to take leave of absence from office have been mounting among opposition politicians after the Federal Criminal Appeals Court ordered the continuation of an investigation into his role in the sale of the former Ciccone Calcográfica minting company.

The leaders who joined the choir were Radical Party (UCR) president Senator Ernesto Sanz, Renewal Front lawmaker Graciela Camaño, UNEN Broad Front leader Margarita Stolbizer and UCR lawmakers Miguel Bazze and Manuel Garrido, who coincided that the vice-president should leave his post over accusations that he used his government position to inappropriately influence business operations in favor of the minting company.

According to the ruling ”Taking into account these facts and the seriousness of the situation, the vice-president should request to be put on temporary leave and comply with the justice system until it determines what really happened in this case,” said Sánz. The UCR leader added that Boudou has been excluded from the inner circle of power of President Cristina Fernández  due to this issue.

For his part, Garrido considered that “if the case against the vice-president progresses, his situation and him continuing to be in that position will become complicated.” He warned that if the court calls on Boudou to be questioned, the case will end up turning into a formal investigation.

Meanwhile, Stolbizer recalled that her party had requested “for a long time that (Boudou) be removed from government” due to his involvement in the Ciccone affair.

“At some point, the president will have to take full ownership over her own errors and decisions,” said the Broad Front-UNEN leader, while the Renewal Front’s Camaño demanded that the government official remove himself from his post in some form or another.

Buenos Aires City lawmaker and ruling Peronist party president Víctor Santa María recognized that “any type of political scandal” is not good for the Peronist party. “Any political scandal isn’t good, I don’t know the issue well enough. But I know Amado (Boudou) and he seems to me a good political leader, that worked hard as Economy Minister and when he was the head of the ANSeS social security agency,” concluded Santa María.

This has been the style of this government and if they think (the opposition) that the vice-president is a weakling they are wrong”.

In other words, this government has not shame an is typical behavior for these Kretins.

The UCR leader added that Boudou has been excluded from the inner circle of power of President Cristina Fernández due to this issue.

Which means if he rats she is trying to limited the damage of the latest money laundering scams by her.

He is saying that CFK is not fit for purpose so why should I resign? The man has no honour or conscience, which when you think about it, makes him perfect for this government.

Well, we can certainly agree on that.

at least this son of a b*tch will end in jail.

more or less the same with jaime, schiavi, lázaro báez, cris, etc.

You are off- topic, this has nothing to do with the British.

This is Argentina's home-grown mess, only.

about argentina or about britain is the same for you.

at least this son of a b*tch will end in jail.

I hope you are right on that one.

CFKs has named just over 7500 permanent government public officers to hold key positions Presidency, Government Secretary, Ministries of Economy, Justice , Planification, Culture , Industry, Telam, State Channel 7, Aerolíneas, Anses, Enarsa, Futbol para todos, etc. Most of them belong to La Campora.

Plus the 360 handpicked judges and the loyal congressman they manage to retain.

Kirchnerism have completely taken over the State.

You cant fire the guys by 2015 because they will already have a 2 year antiquity and you will need a “administrative proceeding” to do so.

””Besides, if they are after my head, I'm not giving up. Our leader (Cristina Fernandez) has undergone several health episodes and government did not move one inch.

The bottom line difference between Boudou and CFK is that CFK was ill and Boudou is a criminal investigation into his alleged involvement in the sale of a minting company.

An honest (no, let's say ethical) politician would remove himself from national governance until he is found guilty. Then the Berlusconi Principle should apply.

It shows how low the credibility of CFK's government has gone.

the position of cameron´s govt so far was to protect blair and his minions.

not to talk that there still are 6000 british soldiers in afghanistan.

not to talk about his plans to take part in a new war in syria.

still OFF-TOPIC.

YOUR crooked and buffoonish  Vice President, callously robbing from the Argentine poor,

YOUR crooked and buffoonish Vice President, callously robbing from the Argentine poor,

you are right.

our problem and an issue we know very well.

guess we are the only ones with enough information to opine about boudou and the 40 thieves.

by irrelevantly accusing the British of events totally unrelated to Bobo and Argentina.

YOUR Vice President is a callous thief.

It is YOUR problem to deal with, and you need do if you wish to maintain credibility and any semblance of integrity.

You are accountable - you will receive Internationsl praise, or criticism, but the world will judge you by your actions whether you like it or not.

But you're always opining about the Falklands, about which you have no information.

Hadn't picked up on this, although, if there is a devaluation/crash as big as we expect them all these poeple will be kickjed out. Afterall, you don't have the continuity of the civil service so, from what I gather, once a new party gets in then they appoint their own Gnocchis/other assorted advisors so this may not be too much of an issue.

@25   It is not that easy to kick them out.

Once they are hired it is virtually impossible to fire them with the draconian labor laws they have here.

They will also be covering their tracks removing any documents that could incriminate themselves to the massive corruption going on.
