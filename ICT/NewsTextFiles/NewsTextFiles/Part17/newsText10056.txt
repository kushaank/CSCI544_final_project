Funding of an $80,000 commitment to a national fruit fly strategy scheme has been welcomed by NSW Farmers.

The announcement from the Federal Government will see an increase into targeted research and development into fruit fly strategies, ensure gaps in policy and regulations are covered and identity efficiencies in the processes.

Peter Darley, NSW Farmers Horticulture Committee Chair, welcomes the funding, as it will help in controlling fruit fly.

Mr Darley said the horticulture industry is viable to the Australian economy, and they should be supported.

In order to help accelerate the development and adoption of effective alternative control regimes, NSW Farmers recommend the State and Federal Government undertake a trial funded program with vulnerable fruit commodities.

“With the control of fruit fly, growers will have less pressure on them and it will increase their ability to access the export market.” he said.
