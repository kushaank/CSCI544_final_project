
Armenian Armed Forces broke ceasefire with Azerbaijani side again last night, the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry said on May 19.

The armed forces of Armenia, located near the Paravakar village of Armenia's Ijevan region, opened fire at the positions of Azerbaijani Armed Forces located in the village of Kohnegishlag of Gazakh region.

At the same time the Azerbaijani positions took fire from the positions located near the villages of Sarijali, Kengerli, Yusifjanli of Aghdam and Goyarkh of Terter region.

Moreover, the Azerbaijani positions went under fire from the positions located at the nameless heights in Khojavend and Fizuli regions.

The Armenian side was silenced with return fire.

The conflict between the two South Caucasus countries began in 1988 when Armenia made territorial claims against Azerbaijan. As a result of the ensuing war, in 1992 Armenian armed forces occupied 20 percent of Azerbaijan, including the Nagorno-Karabakh region and seven surrounding districts.

The two countries signed a ceasefire agreement in 1994. The co-chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group, Russia, France and the U.S. are currently holding peace negotiations.

Armenia has not yet implemented the U.N. Security Council's four resolutions on the liberation of the Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding regions.
