A MEMORIAL service will be held for Peter Oberg this Thursday.

The family of the 45-year-old Goulburn man has decided to go ahead with the service, given that his body has not been found.

Mr Oberg was washed off rocks by a large wave while fishing at Seal Rocks, near Forster, on Wednesday, May 7.

His brother-in-law, Damon Thorpe, and good friend John Keith were also swept into the waters off Sugarloaf Point, but survived.

Police and Surf Lifesaving Australia continued the search for Mr Oberg up until last Tuesday. A report is being prepared for the coroner.

The memorial service will be held at St Saviour’s Cathedral at 1.30pm Thursday.

Peter’s father, Leon, said he was touched that Bishop Stuart Robinson had asked to be involved. Canon Mark Cooper and Reverend Vanessa Bennett, who used to play squash with Peter, would also officiate.

Andrew Oberg will pay tribute to his late brother, while Bishop Robinson will also speak.

Leon said the family had received a condolence letter from Mayor Geoff Kettle and councillors, a phone call from Tony Lamarra in Italy and another from one of Peter’s friends in London, who hoped to attend Thursday’s service.

“We have been overwhelmed by the number of people sending cards and the phone calls,” he said.
