MID Murray Council will drop two of its members at the Local Government election in November and reshuffle its ward boundaries.

The council will comprise of an elected Mayor and nine councillors, reduced from 12 current board members.

The five existing wards will be merged into three and identified as Eyre, which will be represented by three councillors; Shearer, represented by four councillors; and Murray with two.

Mid Murray Council chief executive officer Russell Peate said he was not concerned with the reduction of elected members.

"Our ward councillors were above the required quota," he said.

"It (the number of councillors) hasn't reduced significantly, and when you compare to other councils of a similar size, our ratio of councillors to electors will be similar.

"We were required to undertake an elector review and went through a consultation process, receiving submission from the community, and came up with new wards and new names."
