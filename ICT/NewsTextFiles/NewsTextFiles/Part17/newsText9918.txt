
Out of Sight, explores the lives of blind undocumented migrants from Zimbabwe as they try and eke out a living begging on the streets of Johannesburg.

"Life was tough [in Zimbabwe] because of sanctions. There was no food, everything was complicated, no food, no cash," explains Elizabeth, a blind former school teacher. "A friend just told me they are going to South Africa. It's better when we beg there."

But it is a precarious existence for Elizabeth and her companions who share a room in one of the city's many dilapidated and abandoned buildings. After the danger and difficulty of crossing the border, they are confronted by xenophobia in South Africa, which often blames migrants for the country's stubbornly high rates of poverty and unemployment.
