
The U.S. government is working to hold down the price of your morning cup of coffee.

The Agency for the International Development is stepping up efforts to help Central American farmers fight a devastating coffee disease.

A fungus called coffee rust has caused more than $1 billion in damage across Latin America and it’s already affecting the price of coffees in the U.S.

“We are concerned because we know coffee rust is already causing massive amounts of devastation,” said Raj Shad, head of the U.S. Agency for International Development.

The agency has announced a $5 million partnership with Texas A&M University’s World Coffee Research Center to try to eliminate the disease.
