
Johannesburg - The DA on Monday called on Public Protector Thuli Madonsela to investigate President Jacob Zuma's alleged abuse of power to enrich his nephew.

"A letter has been lodged with the public protector and we hope she will act on it as speedily as possible," Democratic Alliance member James Lorimer said on Monday.

The party wants to know if Zuma ignored the conflict of interest and abused his power to improperly secure private business deals for his nephew Khulubuse Zuma.

On Friday, the Mail&Guardian reported that Zuma allegedly helped secure a US2 million investment for Khulubuse Zuma's Aurora Empowerment Systems company.

The presidency declined to comment on the report.
