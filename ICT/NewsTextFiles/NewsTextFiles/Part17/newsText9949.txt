
Johannesburg - Lonmin says it has dismissed 235 essential services workers.

Spokesperson Happy Nkhoma said on Monday: "These are employees who have been absent since 23 January, so the recent intimidation does not explain their absence.

"A court order to this effect was obtained on 27 February, requiring all essential workers to return to work by 12 May."

Under a recognition agreement signed with the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu), employees engaged in essential services may not participate in any strike.

Nkhoma said the company was not aware of a hit list.

City Press reported on Sunday that there was a hit list containing names of Lonmin staff who had returned to work and their union affiliation.

It was apparently obtained from staff who responded to SMSes the company sent to workers in a bid to end the platinum mining strike.

"We are unaware of such a list. We have a database of employees who have indicated their intention to accept [our wage offer], which is kept highly confidential," Nkhoma said.

Amcu members at Lonmin, Impala, and Anglo American Platinum downed tools on 23 January demanding a basic salary of R12 500 per month.

They have rejected the companies' offer that would see a minimum cash remuneration of R12 500 by July 2017.

The remuneration includes living-out and holiday leave allowances, but excludes medical and retirement benefits and any bonuses.
