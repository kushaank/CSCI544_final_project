U.S. ex-Ambassador to Azerbaijan Matthew Bryza told Vestnik Kavkaza that most resolutions of the UN Security Council were unfulfilled. He noted that the resolutions passed on Nagorno-Karabakh between 30 April and 12 November 1993 had not been realized because organizations of Armenian diasporas, such as the Armenian National Congress in the U.S., started a campaign to depict Azerbaijan as the aggressor and Armenia as the victim.

Armenian and Azerbaijani troops exchanged fire last night in the Geranboy district. According to the Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense, Armenian forces opened fire first, the Azerbaijani servicemen had to return it.

The Georgian Military Road is the only ground connection between Russia and Armenia. The 200-km road connects Vladikavkaz and Tbilisi, running along the rivers of the Greater Caucasus, including the Darial Gorge. The road is often hit by avalanches and blocked for days or weeks in winter and mudslides in the summer.
