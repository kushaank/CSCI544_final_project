
The World Health Organization place Australians amongst the top 6 countries in the world in terms of life expectancy but the new budget might rob Australians of their healthy ranking.

Australian men are expected to reach an age of 80.5 years placing them in the top three countries internationally. But, while Aussie women are placed sixth on the survey they still outlive their male countrymen by more than 4 years.

Baby boys born in 2012 are expected to reach the ripe old age of more than 80 years.Â  Babies born in Iceland come in first with a life expectancy of 81.2 years followed by Switzerland at 80.7 years.

This comes on the back of the recent announcement of budget cuts to Australia’s health care system.Â  These budget cuts may in fact strip Australia of their ranking as one of the countries with the highest life expectancy in the world.

She added that other elements of Australian health contribute to the high life expectancy ranking.Â  These include excellent sanitation andÂ readily available, good quality fresh food and water.

She warned that the planned Federal budget cuts in terms of health funding could significantly impact on the WHO’s next survey and Australia may not hold on to their position much longer.

‘Internationally the evidence tells us the focus on primary healthcare and preventative health is the most effective and financially efficient way to do this,’ she said.

The WHO’s statistics show an international increase in life expectancy for those born after 2012.Â  Japanese women still outlive the rest of the world and are expected to reach an age of 87 years.
