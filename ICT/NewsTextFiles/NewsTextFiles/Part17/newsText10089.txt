
RANDOLPH TWP. -- The Bill Hove Agency for Farmers Insurance will sponsor a Salvation Army “Culinary Corps” food tasting event at 6 p.m. on Thursday, May 22.

The agency will host the Salvation Army Dover Culinary Corps event to benefit the children of Morris County.

It will take place at Skylands, located on Route 10 in the township.

All proceeds from the event will benefit the Salvation Army Dover Corps six week onsite summer camp and give children an opportunity to attend the Salvation Army’s one week overnight camp, Camp Tecumseh.

Last year, 80 children from Morris County benefited from these programs. For event information and to purchase tickets or make a donation to The Salvation Army, call 973.366.0764.
