
More bad news for Gulf Coast-area rice farmers: State regulators on Friday proposed a plan for managing the lower Colorado River basin that would likely deny them water deliveries for years to come.

Gulf Coast rice farmers who have gone three years without water supplies from Central Texas' Highland Lakes could be in store for many more dry years, even if the current drought conditions improve.

In other words, the LCRA's proposed plan for managing the lower Colorado River basin — relied upon by more than a million Central Texas residents and rice farmers downstream — isn't good enough. According to the TCEQ recommendations, LCRA's plan doesn't cut off water to rice farmers soon enough, putting at risk the water supplies for upstream cities and manufacturers. In the future, the TCEQ said, the Highland Lakes should have much more water in them before the river authority delivers water to farmers.

Responding to the TCEQ recommendation on Monday, the LCRA said it would "conduct a thorough analysis of the material over the next two to three months."

Even under "normal" conditions," in the TCEQ proposal, it would be harder for rice farmers to get water, because the trigger level that would allow for irrigation releases would be higher.

The LCRA has maintained that it is simply following the current water management plan, which TCEQ approved in 2010.
