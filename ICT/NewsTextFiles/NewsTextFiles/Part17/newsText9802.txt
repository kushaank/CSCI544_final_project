
Total has announced that it has invited direct foreign investment in its Marketing and Services affiliate, Total Maroc, and that Zahid Group , headquartered in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, has become a 30% shareholder of the company. Total Maroc is also currently preparing an initial public offering (IPO) on the Casablanca Stock Exchange, which would allow individual Moroccan shareholders and institutional investors to acquire 15% of the shares of Total Maroc. The IPO is expected to be launched in the near future. Total will continue to retain a controlling interest in Total Maroc and operate it.

"Having outside partners acquire interests in our affiliates is a key component of Total's strategy in the petroleum products and services retail sector in Africa and the Middle East, and a critical factor in long-term success," explained Momar Nguer, Senior Vice President, Africa/Middle East at Total Marketing & Services. "Not only does it allow us to further strengthen the local roots of Total's different affiliates by giving local and regional investors a stake in their performance, it also opens up new business opportunities through partners that trust Total as an operator," he added.

Total has operated in Morocco since 1926 and aims to cement its long-term position and support the country's continued growth by welcoming new investors. An affiliate that sells multiple products and is solidly established in its market, Total Maroc is, in fact, a mainstay of Total's downstream business in Africa, through its size, financial performance and ability to provide a deep pool of talent for the Groupâ€™s activities worldwide.
