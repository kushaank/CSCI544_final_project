
Haiti’s Ministry of Tourism and Mexico’s National Fund for Tourism Development have signed a new agreement on tourism cooperation.

The memorandum of understanding signed last week came under a larger tourism pact signed between the two countries in July 2012 that aimed to develop and strengthen cooperation between the two sides.

The new memorandum promotes the exchange of experience on tourism infrastructure project development, according to Haiti’s Tourism Ministry.

According to the terms of the agreement, the first area of cooperation will be Haiti’s Tourism Development Plan for the country’s southern coast.

During their meeting, Haiti Tourism Minister Stephanie Villedrouin presented the Master Plan to FONATUR Director General Hector Martin Gomez Barraza, a plan which was developed with guidance from Mexico.

The agreement is the latest such pact signed by Haiti with its counterparts in Latin America and the Caribbean. Similar agreements have been signed over the last few years with Ecuador and Antigua and Barbuda.
