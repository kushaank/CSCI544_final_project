
JOHANNESBURG, May 19 (Reuters) - South African mobile operator Vodacom Group said on Monday it had reached an agreement to buy unlisted telecoms firm Neotel in a deal worth 7 billion rand ($676 million) although it would not assume any of the company's debt.

Neotel, majority-owned by India's Tata Communications , is South Africa's second-biggest fixed-line phone operator and gives Vodacom a large fibre optic network for high-speed Internet.

"Effectively, they have to settle the debt. We are not going to take over existing debt," Vodacom chief executive Shameel Joosub told reporters.

Both Vodacom and Tata declined to divulge further details of the agreement.
