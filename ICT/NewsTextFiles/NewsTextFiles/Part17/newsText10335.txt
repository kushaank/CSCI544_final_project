A bid by the Abbott government to reduce world heritage protection for Tasmanian forests is  considered likely to fail after it ruled out negotiating with other countries to get its proposal up.

Australia's attempt to delist 74,000 hectares of mainly old-growth forest in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area was rejected in a draft decision of the World Heritage Committee released on Saturday.

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature advised the committee that winding back world heritage status would be ''clearly inappropriate''.

Environment Minister Greg Hunt on Monday rejected a suggestion by Greens leader Christine Milne that Australia would try to trade support for its proposal for benefits to other nations when the committee meets in Doha next month.

Australia will attend, but is not on the committee.
