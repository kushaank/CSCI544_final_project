
INTERNAL strife in the Democratic Alliance (DA) and Agang SA was on display at the weekend, just as the African National Congress (ANC) was preparing for a meeting to finalise the appointment on Monday of premiers for the eight provinces it runs.

Disquiet reigned within the ranks of South Africa’s opposition over apparent moves by the respective DA and Agang leaders to influence the makeup of their parliamentary caucuses.

DA leader Helen Zille on Sunday accused some DA members of collaborating with the media during party discussions on parliamentary positions. She said the DA would seek a meeting with the editors of Business Day and the Sunday Times, amid concerns that individuals in the party were using the media to pursue personal agendas and influence succession battles.

Dr Ramphele announced last week that she was taking a break from politics. This had the effect of putting Agang’s national youth forum co-ordinator, Nyameka Mguzulo, and chairman, Mike Tshishonga, in Parliament.

Dr Ramphele surprised supporters when she revealed that she would not be taking either of the party’s two seats in the National Assembly.

On Friday, members of Agang in Gauteng called for a vote of no confidence in Dr Ramphele, citing the "parachuting" of Ms Mguzulo, who had been number 10 on the party’s list.

Agang deputy president Andries Tlouamma said on Sunday the vote of no confidence had now been set aside, but provinces had requested that a conference be held to discuss the party’s leadership, as well as its constitution. Mr Tlouamma said Dr Ramphele had written a letter to Parliament clarifying that he and Mr Tshishonga would be the MPs.

The fresh ructions in the DA came to the fore as it prepared to assume its position as the official opposition in the National Assembly later this week. Ms Zille on Sunday denied that she had launched a scathing attack on the record of former DA parliamentary leader Lindiwe Mazibuko during a recent meeting.

In a statement, Ms Zille denied the substance of a Sunday Times report, saying "it is time to draw a line in the sand" and the party would discuss a response to members "driving distorted factional agendas through allies in the press".

Ms Zille’s statement was prompted by the report saying that she had told the DA’s federal executive meeting in Johannesburg on Friday that she had "made" and "saved" Ms Mazibuko. On Sunday Ms Zille said the report came from "selective leaks" amid a "full, open, frank discussion among adults seeking to deal with a complex situation and move forward".

Ms Mazibuko revealed last week that she had decided not to stand for re-election as parliamentary leader, and would instead take up a scholarship at Harvard University.

The decision is said to have been prompted by the expectation that she would lose the election to national spokesman Mmusi Maimane, who is said to enjoy Ms Zille’s support. Ms Zille responded to the Sunday Times report that she had never worked harder than in promoting Ms Mazibuko’s career, but a "Berlin Wall" had been erected between their offices.

"Major decisions were made without any discussion, resulting in serious mistakes, for which I then stepped forward and took responsibility," Ms Zille said.
