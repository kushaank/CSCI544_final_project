
Pakistani teenage education activist Malala Yousafzai has stressed the need to promote the culture of tolerance and education in order to restore lasting peace.

Yousafzai was speaking on Sunday by videolink from Britain to about 300 participants at the Inventive Youth Forum in her home region, the Swat Valley of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Yousafzai drew worldwide attention in October 2012 after she was shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban for promoting education for girls and speaking out against atrocities committed by the Taliban. She was initially treated in a military hospital in Pakistan before being airlifted to Britain, where she underwent successful surgery on her skull and ear.

"Our struggle for education will continue to ensure that each and every child gets the education," she said in her video address. "We are hopeful to achieve this goal as youth are committed in our joint struggle to promote education."

The teenage activist expressed hope that peace would be restored in the militancy-ridden Swat Valley soon so that the community could focus on educating its children.

"It is needed for all of us to understand each other and promote tolerance and passion among ourselves," she said.

Yousafzai was nominated for last year's Nobel Peace Prize, eventually awarded to the Netherlands-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

In December 2012, Pakistan and UNESCO unveiled the Malala Plan, which aims to enroll all girls worldwide in school by the end of 2015.
