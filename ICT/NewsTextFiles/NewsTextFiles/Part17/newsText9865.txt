
In a unique definition of ‘mobile marketing‘, Cape Town Tourism has invested in a Mercedes Benz panel van to become a truly mobile Visitors Information Centre, which travels to events, parks at Cape Town’s major attractions, and generally will be visible and available at the popular places where the tourists are in the city.  The new vehicle is called Thando, being the isiXhosa name for love, and was launched at World Travel Market Africa last month as the first mobile Visitor Information Centre in Africa.

Cape Town Tourism CEO Enver Duminy said of the new mobile tourist information service: ‘We have tracked a rising trend of visitors and would-be visitors using our online portals to access information about Cape Town. It is this call for mobility and ease of access that has inspired our move to create a personal interface that will be able to assist Capetonians and visitors at gatherings or in spaces where there is sudden seasonal traffic’.

The mobile Visitor Information Centre allows bookings to be made for Cape Town Tourism member products and services, and for SANParks properties.  Via Computicket and Webtickets one can buy tickets for shows, events, and bus transport. Free wifi is available, and crates covered with colourful African print material offer seating outside the panel van.  A TV screen allows tourists to learn more about Cape Town, and is supported with Cape Town Tourism Visitors’ Guides, and  brochures of some members’ products and services.

Cape Town Tourism has justified its panel van brand choice on the basis of its efficient fuel consumption, reduced emissions, and its operation is solar-powered, demonstrating the tourism body’s commitment to Responsible Tourism.

A promotional road trip commences on 9 June, and via Facebook friends and supporters can follow the journey of the vehicle, with prizes offered for the correct identification of the location of Thando every day.

Thando is a creative definition of the mobile marketing of our destination.  While it will not attract tourists to Cape Town, at least it can better inform the tourists that are already in our city!
