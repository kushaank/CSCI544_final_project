In line with the directives of His Highness Shaikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, the Dubai Customs has completed fishermen harbours project in Jumeirah and Umm Suqeim. The project that aims at reviving traditional fishing heritage and improving the life of fishermen includes 466 docks for fishing and recreational boats, apart from a variety of services for fishermen and tourists.

The beneficiaries of the project include 1,000 labourers and seamen, according to an official. The official said that the project that commenced in mid-2008 involved the development of three harbours — Jumeirah 1, Umm Suqeim 1 and Umm Suqeim 2 — and aimed at restoring their unique appeal.

He said the second part of the project is dedicated to improve fishermen’s everyday life with facilities like special fisheries for them, warehouses to store fishing tools, boat repair workshops, and seamen accommodation units, and two fish markets — one in Jumeirah 1 and another in Umm Suqeim 1. “Both fish markets in Jumeirah 1 and Umm Suqeim 1 were opened. The rest of the facilities will become in service on the course of this year,” he said.

He said the first of these restaurants is the Seaview Restaurant which opened in Umm Suqeim 1, where a mini-mart has also opened. Sea More Café, Charm Thai Cuisine and a mini-mart are also in service now in Jumeirah 1 harbour, where a Pizzaro Restaurant will also open this month.

The official said all these facilities will cater to the needs of fishermen and residents and will attract tourists by providing them an incredible waterfront experience with some of the best views in Dubai.
