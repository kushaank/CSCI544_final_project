
Dubai’s Attorney General Issam Isa Al Humaidan has ordered referral to the court of the case of the Ethiopian maid who poured boiling water on her employer’s children and attacked them with a chopper at a house in Al Warqa.

Al Humaidan said that the Prosecution had accused the house maid of premeditated murder and attempted theft in addition to destroying other’s property for which the penalty could be a sentence of life in jail.

“We ask the court to implement the stiffest penalty against the accused because of the brutality of her crime. The accused was determined to kill the children despite of their cries. She continued to attack them with the chopper though they were bleeding,” he said.

However, society should take this crime as a lesson and should learn from it to help avoid such incidents, he added.

Al Humaidan said Dubai Prosecution has finished investigating the case. The housemaid had made a detailed confession of what she did and her motives.

He noted that the Prosecution had faced a major difficulty in hearing the testimonies of the elder girl and her sister and brother because of their burns and wounds and their psychological condition after the attack by the housemaid.

The three children spoke about their moments of terror when they woke up as the maid was attacking them with a chopper and poured boiled water on them until police arrived to rescue them.
