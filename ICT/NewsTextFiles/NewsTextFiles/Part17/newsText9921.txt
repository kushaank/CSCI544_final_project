Verner Elementary School fifth-grade teacher Kathy Perkins was chosen as one of five teachers from across the nation who will travel to Tanzania in July as part of the Trick-or-Treat UNICEF School Challenge.

The challenge is part of an effort to support educators in teaching children about the needs of their peers in other countries and about the importance of giving, according to a news release.

The grand-prize winners — Perkins and teachers from Georgia, Oregon, Texas and Michigan — are traveling to Tanzania to see UNICEF programs for children that are focused on early childhood education, teacher training, life skills, the environment and health.

Perkins was selected because her class used student ambassadors to spread the word about UNICEF to other students, selling hot chocolate and creating and selling rubber band bracelets at school to raise funds for the campaign.

Perkins said being able to see the impact that the donations made firsthand will motivate her to do even more. She said the trip will help her students because she’ll bring back photos and other items to show them that what they did helped real people.

According to a news release, Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF has raised more than $172 million in its 64-year history to support UNICEF’s work in providing medicine, clean water, nutrition, education, emergency relief and more.

The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) works in more than 190 countries and territories to save and improve children’s lives.
