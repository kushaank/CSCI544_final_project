The biggest dinosaur ever found by Paleontologists has been discovered in Argentina. Known as the titanosaurus dinosaur, it is believed to be the largest dinosaur to ever have roamed the earth.

Officials from the Museo Paleontologico Egidio Feruglio told reporters that the massive bones of the huge herbivore, believed to date back to the late Cretaceous period, are very impressive. According to them, the titanosaur was a sauropod that roamed the forests of Patagonia around 95 million years ago.

The size of the prehistoric creature was determined by the massive leg bones found. Scientists then calculated that the titanosaur dinosaur weighed around 170,000 pounds, measured 130 feet long and 65 feet tall .

“Originally thought to weigh in at 100 tonnes, [Argentinosaurus] was later revised down to about 70 tonnes — just under the 77 tonnes that this new sauropod is thought to have weighed,” the BBC reported.

Carballido added that the new titanosaur dinosaur still needs an official name, and one that befits its size: “It will be named describing its magnificence and in honor to both the region and the farm owners who alerted us about the discovery,” he said.

It remains to be seen what the massive dinosaur found in Argentina will be named officially, but we think that titanosaurus dinosaur works pretty well. What do you think? Share your thoughts with us in the comments feed provided below.
