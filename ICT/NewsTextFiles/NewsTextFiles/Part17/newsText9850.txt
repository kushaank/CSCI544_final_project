
Nairobi, Kenya: The African Development Bank (AfDB) is stepping up plans to help improve economic growth in the continent.

Part of the repositioning includes creation of the Africa50 Infrastructure Fund, which is set to increase the level of investment funds channelled into sectors.

The Fund for example intends to mobilise from the stock market over Sh8.5 trillion ($100billion) for infrastructure development and will target lending to the private sector to enhance their participation in the development of the economy.

Â “This is a bold new proposal to develop the continent’s infrastructure by lending to high-return infrastructural development investments to unlock the continent’s potential,” said Gabriel Negatu.

Negatu, the Regional Director, Eastern Africa Regional Centre, African Development Bank was in Nairobi during a breakfast meeting as the bank celebrates 50 years since it was formed.

Established in 1964, AfDB is celebrating its 50th anniversary to mark half a century of development aid to the continent.

The bank was started with a staff of 10 and a capital base of $250 million. It has since grown to a staff of 2,000 across its areas of operation and an authorised capital budget base of over $103 billion.

“This is not only the time to pause but also to look ahead at the mountains we need to climb to get Africa ahead,” Negatu said.

He explained that the bank places a great deal of emphasis on Africa’s strategic priority sectors such as infrastructural development, agricultural rural development.
