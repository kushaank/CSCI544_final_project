
IT SEEMS it is winter again, which is okay if you are the member (of the Upper Jukskei Fly-fishing Collective), because at least he has a pair of boots in which to fish and absolutely no intention of sacrificing any part of his anatomy to gain entry into a cohort of his peers.

Each winter, many South African boys withdraw from society to undergo hardship in a ritualised test of manhood, including circumcision. Many boys will be horribly injured when their prepuces are crudely hacked off in unsanitary conditions. Many will die.

Circumcision of men and boys, in the opinion of the member, is genital mutilation no different from the widely condemned practice of genital mutilation of women and girls. Tradition or no tradition, religious or otherwise, in either sex it is cruel, atavistic and primitive. Other than in the relatively rare event of the medical condition paraphimosis and a number of infections, there is no reason to perform circumcision other than to establish dominance.

The same goes for the practice of adult male medical circumcision (MMC) under the ruse of preventing HIV transmission from women to men, except here medical men act as a class to force into submission uninformed men in what the Department of Health describes as low-income areas.

The member hopes his attitude really irritates this class of medical practitioner, which must include Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi and his minions rolling out the Bophelo Pele MMC campaign.

Two winters ago, when this columnist pointed out the medical and scientific inadequacies of the three randomised controlled trials conducted in Africa between 2005 and 2007 on which the campaign is based, public health sociologist Dirk Taljaard roundly abused him for quackery, suggesting that the scientific opinion that discredited the trials has itself been discredited.

Perhaps, but that does not summarily vindicate the African trials. In yet another paper, A Fatal Irony: Why the "circumcision solution" to the AIDS epidemic in Africa may increase transmission of HIV, by Yale researcher and Oxford fellow Brian Earp, the trials are reviewed again, and again found wanting. Earp’s main thesis is based on behavioural risk compensation, but because it would be unethical to test that experimentally, it is impossible to verify. What we have is a considered opinion, which is precisely the class of evidence gathered in the trials.

In a critique of Earp’s paper, a leading proponent of MMC in SA, Nathan Geffen, rejects what he calls the "much-touted but evidence-free view that circumcised men will be at greater risk of HIV infection because they will take more risks due to the false belief that circumcision protects them", yet he cites the equally evidence-free views expressed in the African trials and those drawn from his own baseline study at Orange Farm to reject Earp’s notion.

Earp and Geffen are faced with the same dilemma: neither can verify their correlations as axiomatic because it would be unethical to expose people to disease. Correlation is weak evidence at best. You can correlate almost anything coinciding in space and time, but it does not make it meaningful. The treatment in randomised controlled trials must be hidden from the recipient and from the researcher for the experiment to be valid. Men cannot hide their penises from themselves, circumcised or intact.

Earp may be forgiven because he is not proposing invasive surgery, but Motsoaledi, Geffen, Taljaard, et al, are promoting what amounts to genital mutilation, the benefits of which cannot be verified. Further, the contradictory evidence about Langerhans cells (a possible site for HIV transmission) in the prepuce means the clinical indicators for the trials have been uncertain from the start.

At best, MMC is ethically doubtful, most certainly harmful and of no verifiable benefit. The Bophelo Pele campaign aims to treat 4-million South African men in this way.
