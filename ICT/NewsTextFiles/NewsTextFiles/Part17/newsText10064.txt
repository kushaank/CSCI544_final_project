A true sea monster turned up on the beach of Nags Head, North Carolina, on Monday. The creature in question was a lancetfish, a deep-sea fish that is known for its huge jaws, lengthy teeth, prominent dorsal fin, and a propensity for eating its own kind.

Visitors at Jeannetteâ€™s Pier in Nags Head witnessed the fish wash up onto the shore alive. Some fishers pulled it from the sand and took it back out into the water in their boat, only to see it wash up on shore again. The fish was probably sick, according to researchers.
