
BOSTON, USA (CMC) -- The United States Coast Guard says it has suspended its active search, pending further developments, for four Britons, whose yacht capsized in the Atlantic Ocean as they made their way back to the United Kingdom from the Caribbean over the weekend.

The Coast Guard said the crew of the 40 foot sailing vessel, ‘Cheeki Rafiki’, was returning from what is considered to be one of the world’s most prestigious regattas in Antigua, when the four sailors went missing in treacherous conditions.

The missing sailors, who are presumed dead, are Andrew Bridge, 21, James Male, 23, Steve Warren, 52, and Paul Goslin, 56.

British Daily Mail newspaper reported that the men had been sailing the Cheeki Rafiki, a Beneteau performance racer yacht, back from the Antigua Sailing Week regatta.

The US Coast Guard said it had searched the waters for the missing sailors about 1,000 miles east of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, up to 5:00 am (local time) on Sunday.

The Coast Guard said it was told by the United Kingdom representatives of the ‘Cheeki Rafiki’ the last message they received from the crew on Friday indicated they were taking on water with four people on board.

The Coast Guard said on Sunday, they located an overturned hull that matched the description of the Cheeki Rafiki, but no signs of the sailors.

“We appreciate the assistance of the US Air Force, Canadian and the three merchant vessels helping us to conduct a thorough search so far from shore,” said Captain Anthony Popiel, 1st Coast Guard District Chief of Response.

“We are extremely disappointed that we were not able to locate the sailors during the course of this extensive search. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families during this difficult time,” he added.

The sailors on board the Cheeki Rafiki were described as “very experienced offshore yachtsmen””.
