
Six South Africans – two women and four men – have been arrested for the gruesome killing of 52-year-old Catherina Nkovani from Thomo Village in the town of Giyani in the northern Limpopo Province.According to the South African Police Services on Monday, Nkovani was allegedly killed on April 27 after the funeral of her sister-in-law. The suspects accused Nkovani of bewitching the sister-in-law.

The sister-in-law, named Phindile Ngovani, was sick for quite some time before she died in April.

“Following her funeral, members of the community, including the husband of the deceased, accused Nkovani of bewitching the deceased.

“Nkovani was attacked and assaulted just after the funeral – only a few metres away from the cemetery – with an assortment of objects before she was set alight,” the police said in a statement.

The police and emergency services were summoned. However, the mob-justice victim died a day later of her wounds at a hospital.

All the suspects that have been arrested so far are believed to be relatives of Nkovani, the police said, adding that investigations are still continuing.
