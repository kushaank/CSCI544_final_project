
SIALKOT: JUI-S chief Maulana Samiul Haq has said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has shown undue haste in inviting Indian prime minister-elect Narindar Modi to visit Pakistan.

Speaking at a press conference at Daskaâ€™s Darul Aloom Medina here on Sunday, he alleged Modi had killed thousands of Indian Muslims therefore Nawaz Sharif should have thought twice before inviting him to the country.

Maulana Sami expressed hope about resumption of talks between the government and the (outlawed) Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, saying the state was sincere in solving the burning issue of terrorism.

â€œI think the disgruntled elements in the Taliban have agreed to resume peace talks with the government,â€� he said. He reiterated some elements were trying to derail the peace process to pave the way for operation in tribal areas.

The JUI-S chief said operation was no solution to the problem and negotiation was the only way to bring about peace. Efforts to restore peace would continue and the government and the army should encourage these, he said. The Taliban, he said, did not violate the truce.

He urged all the national institutions to focus on the one-point agenda of establishing durable peace, saying the Taliban were fighting to save Pakistan and Afghanistan from conspiracies of India. Pakistan should improve its relations with all neighbours, he said.

KHWAJA ASIF: Federal Minister for Water and Power Khwaja Muhammad Asif has stressed the need to promote politics of tolerance in the country.

Speaking to newsmen at his residence, he urged the politicians to shun conflicts and short-term interests. He said PTI chief Imran Khan was doing the politics of conflicts by raising the ante about alleged rigging in the 2013 general elections.

â€œBoth Imran Khan and Pervez Musharraf do politics through the social media,â€� he remarked.

Police official Nazeer Ahmed told Dawn that militants had planted explosives inside the shrine of Sheikh Taqi Baba.

"he alleged Modi had killed thousands of Indian Muslims therefore Nawaz Sharif should have thought twice before inviting him to the country".

Relax Maulana, Modi may come , may not come. Don't start premature controversy. PM can invite any head of state. Let's concentrate on negotiations that you are part of. keep your nose out of rest of the politics.

Man Mohan Singh, now an ex-PM has been invited so many times, by Nawaz Sharif . Instead he made so many overtures and did not even set his foot towards Pakistan. Narendra Modi is doubtful will ever visit Pakistan.

Throw away this mullah.We want good ties with India.It is a must.

He is right we do not need to invite him unless modi amends his ways.

Khawaja Asif has wrongly qouted both Imran Khan and extend President of Pakistan General Retired Pervez Musharraf enjoying equal political status. He should have some gray matter while comparing the two. One has served the nation throughout his life and the other still crawling.How both could be equal.

I hope Maulana saheb would say some thing about Taliban who are killing muslims in Pakistan.

May be Nawaz Sharif wanted to know the tricks that secured huge victory to Modi..

On this he is right. No need to invite Modi. He is behind the murder of thousands of muslims. As for Khawaj, well he needs to realise he should be loyal to the armed forces of the country that he lives in and protects it. Otherwise he can move to India since he talks their language.

Nawaz Shareef's favourite writer must have been Isabel Wolff, the author of Post Haste. He does most of the things without consulting his mind & in haste.

Moulvis (and maulanas) in  Pakistan, generally speaking,  are not taken seriously when they speak on national issues. However, when they speak sense, we should lend our ears to them.  Maulana Samiul Haq is a man of caliber, at least better than 'maulana diesel'. I fully agree with Maulana Samiul Haq  when he says why Nawaz Sharif has hastened to invite Narinder Modi to visit Pakistan. We should wait watch and see BJP's and the new indian government's policies viz-a-viz Pakistan. Instead of looking for his industrial empire's commercial interests Nawaz Sharif should uphold Pakistan's integrity and honour in dealing with the new indian government.

Moulana in this case is right. Nawaz should not have invited Modi hastily. It shows immaturity. Nawaz has done such things with India in the past, but achieved nothing. At one time he tried to make personal friendship with indian PM that his sons called Indian PM "Uncle".
