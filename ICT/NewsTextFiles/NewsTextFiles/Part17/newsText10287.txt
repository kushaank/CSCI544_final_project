
THE federal government's New Colombo Plan has received a new, high-profile supporter in Indonesia's foreign ministry, which has offered to host Australian interns.

Parliamentary secretary for foreign affairs Senator Brett Mason is in Jakarta to promote the scheme, which sends undergraduates to the Indo-Pacific region for professional and cultural enrichment.

He says Indonesia's Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa has shown his support by offering to host Australian interns at his ministry.

Like many prominent Indonesians, Dr Natalegawa studied in Australia.

The New Colombo Plan recognises young Australians have much to gain from spending time in Indonesia and other neighbouring nations, Senator Mason said.

"Dr Natalegawa was very generous in offering internships for young Australian students. I think young Australians would find that very, very exciting," he told reporters on Monday.

Senator Mason's visit to Jakarta comes as Foreign Minister Julie Bishop prepares to meet Dr Natalegawa for more talks on the code of conduct that will guide the bilateral relationship after last year's spy scandal.

Ms Bishop's office says the ministers are making plans with the defence ministers for the annual "2+2" meeting.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott is then expected to meet next month with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who hopes to have the code finalised by August before he departs from office later this year.

The New Colombo Plan is already mid-way through its pilot phase, with around 300 students on work and study placements in Indonesia, Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong.

The second tranche of funding, released last week, gives a further 1000 students the chance to take part and brings the funding to $4.72 million so far.

Students are undertaking programs in areas such as education, language study, housing policy and business.
