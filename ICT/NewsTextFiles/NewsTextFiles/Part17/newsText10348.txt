
South Australia's Clare Valley region has celebrated 30 years of its Gourmet Weekend.

The two-day event is said to be Australia's longest-running regional food and wine festival.

To coincide with the anniversary, the valley held its inaugural Hall of Fame awards to honour major players in the region, both past and present.

Kilikanoon Wines founder, Kevin Mitchell, was named Winemaker of the Year.

"I like the idea of making wines that really shout about the valley," he said.

"The wines we have here are very unique in the sense they really represent what Clare's about - its coolness, its elevation, its diversity."

"Riesling is very much part of our history, we're famous for it," he said.

"But realistically, it's probably only our fifth most important variety.

"People should remember we also make brilliant shiraz and cabernet in Clare."

Colin Hinze, from Taylors Wines, was named best viticulturalist and the Rising Star Award went to Steve Baraglia from Pikes Wines.

Neil Paulett, winemaker and chair of Clare Valley Winemakers Incorporated, says taking a risk and starting the festival 30 years ago has paid off.

"As a region, we've always been fairly innovative and progressive. We've never been afraid to try things," he said.

"We get a spike in [wine] orders following the weekend for a while, so something happens out there.

"[The event] is to get people to understand who we are, what we are and just to get that sense of place."
