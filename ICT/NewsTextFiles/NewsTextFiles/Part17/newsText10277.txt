
Marking this year’s International Day Against Homophobic and Transphobia, Same Same sat down with America’s Ambassador to Australia John Berry, getting his views on a range of topics making LGBTI news this year.

“There are places where gay people fear for their lives, and are killed on an all-too sadly regular basis,” he told us. “I think our communities in countries where we’ve been more fortunate have a special responsibility to be engaged – to hold up those beacons of light, so that the people who suffer in those communities know that it does not have to be that way.

“The world can fight homophobia. That’s why the International Day Against Homophobia is so important,” he added. “We need to communicate to our brothers and sisters in less fortunate places that we have not forgotten them, that we stand together, that gay rights are human rights.

US President Barack Obama nominated Berry for his diplomatic post last year. He and his husband Curtis flew down to join us here in Australia in September, right after their wedding in Washington DC.

As a happily married gay man, marriage equality was of course one of the topics we spoke about with Berry, who showed us around his office at the Embassy of the United States of America in Canberra, located just a few blocks from Parliament House.

We were also keen to get Berry’s ideas for Australia and America’s work together to achieve an end to HIV, which, as he explains, is a topic close to his heart.

Same Same also asked the Ambassador about accepting diversity in sport, and why Barack Obama’s support for LGBTI people is so important to Americans and to the rest of the world.

Akersten has to lose that hat!  On another note the ambassador is pretty cool.
