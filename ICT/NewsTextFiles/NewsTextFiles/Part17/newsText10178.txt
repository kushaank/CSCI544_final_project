
ABU DHABI: Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak has described Malaysia's 6.2% GDP growth in the first quarter of the year as outstanding.

The Prime Minister said the growth reflected the country's strong economy.

"That is an outstanding performance and I hope we can sustain it," he told reporters here.

Malaysia’s economy grew faster than expected at 6.2% in the first quarter, driven by stronger expansion in domestic demand and a turnaround in net exports, said Bank Negara .

“We expect GDP growth in the subsequent quarters to remain in the region of 5% to 5.5%. This will bring us very close to the upper-end of the GDP projection for the year as a whole,” Bank Negara governor Tan Sri Dr  Zeti Akhtar Aziz  said.
