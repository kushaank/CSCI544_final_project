
Former Prime Minister Dr Salim Ahmed Salim speaks at a function organised by Tushikamane Pamoja Foundation in Dar es Salaam at the weekend.

161m/- was raised at a fundraiser dinner for the elderly where former Secretary General of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) Dr Salim Ahmed Salim called for public support to augment government efforts in care provision to the country’s elderly community.

Speaking at the event over the weekend in Dar es Salaam Dr. Salim said most of old people folk in the country endure very difficult conditions due to lack of support and care from the community noting that  government aid is simply not sufficient.

Dr Salim said it is the responsibility of the general public to help the elderly as well as other marginalised and special need groups.

“Helping elders is everybody’s responsibility…we have to ensure that they live in better houses and have access to food and health services,” he said.

The former OAU Secretary General commended Tushikamane Pamoja Foundation (TPF) who organised the fundraiser dinner to raise funds for the construction of houses for the elderly in Dar es Salaam saying the move is to be emulated by other groups.

TPF Chairperson, Rose Mwapachu said the need is dire and growing.

“With concerted communal involvement we can meet the challenge,” she urged the attendants.

She gave a brief track record of the organisation saying it was founded to foster public participation in elder care service provision through direct donations and involvement in community projects.

At the fundraiser, the foundation raised 161m/- and a pledge to receive 5,000 bricks from various individuals and companies.
