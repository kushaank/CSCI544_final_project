
That’s how organiser Neil Penning summed-up the Goulburn Rotary Club’s May 3 farmers market.

Single digit temperatures, wind and sleeting rain once more deterred stall holders and customers from Belmore Park.

It was the third poor showing in as many attempts and leaves the organising committee searching for answers.

One of those answers, Mr Penning believes, is a roof.

Inclement weather has overshadowed each of the Rotary Club’s markets to date and is affecting stall-holder confidence.

Eliminate the conditions and the concept might grow, he says.

“It was so bloody cold, nobody turned up,” Mr Penning said.

They’re unlikely to stay on board if the bleak turnouts continue, however.

While Mr Penning is powerless to alter the weather, he can explore alternate locations.

“We’re after a consistent venue.

In winter, that means an indoor venue,” he explained.

“I’ve spoken to a couple of real estate agents; they’re out looking.

The farmers markets - held on the first Saturday of each month - began in March.

They take place on the same ground in Belmore Park long occupied by Lilac Committee-run markets.

A decision by Goulburn Mulwaree Council to last year withdraw all in-kind support for the Lilac Committee forced a reshuffle.

Two rival monthly markets now operate on the same day, just one block apart.

Lilac Committee members found their stall-holders a new home on the grass of St Saviour’s Common.

The move has been well received.

“We’ve had good comments from stall holders and the customers,” Market coordinator Heather Landow said last month.

Whether or not the Rotary Club can follow their rivals’ lead and find a new home to see off the winter remains to be seen.

“If anyone has anything in mind, that’d be appreciated,” Mr Penning said.
