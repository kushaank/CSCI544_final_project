
PESHAWAR – Taliban’s intermediary committee member Maulana Yousuf Shah has said that the committee representing militia wanted immediate restoration of peace talks with the government.

In a statement issued here on Monday, Yousuf Shah said that Taliban were ready for talks and were waiting for the government response to fix date and venue. He said that his team would strongly oppose use of force, as only dialogues could bring peace in the area.

Earlier, Taliban’s chief intermediary Samiul Haq admitted that the infighting in the Tehreek-e-Taliban has created obstacles for the fragile peace process. Bloody clashes pitted loyalists of Taliban ‘commanders’ Khan Said Mehsud and Sheharyar Mehsud, as both interested in leadership in South Waziristan Agency.
