
Johannesburg - The DA on Monday called on Public Protector Thuli Madonsela to investigate President Jacob Zuma 's alleged abuse of power to enrich his nephew.

"A letter has been lodged with the public protector and we hope she will act on it as speedily as possible," Democratic Alliance member James Lorimer said on Monday.

The party wants to know if Zuma ignored the conflict of interest and abused his power to improperly secure private business deals for his nephew Khulubuse Zuma.

On Friday, the Mail & Guardian reported that Zuma allegedly helped secure a $2m investment for Khulubuse Zuma's Aurora Empowerment Systems company.

The presidency declined to comment on the report.

"President Zuma continues to abuse state power for his own enrichment and that of his family," said Lorimer.

"At a time when South Africa needs clean governance to facilitate economic growth, President Zuma, with his growing list of scandals, is not fit to hold office for another term."

The DA wants Madonsela to investigate if Zuma violated the Executive Ethics Act by using his position to enrich himself or improperly benefit another person, and acting in a way that may compromise the credibility or integrity of his office.
