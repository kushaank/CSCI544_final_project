
Nearly 100 chicken farmers in Chaiyaphum yesterday called for Krungthai Bank to rehabilitate the Bt104 million debt that Saha Farm Group, one of Thailand's leading poultry exporters, reportedly owes them.

They also vowed to create a major movement nationwide if there was no progress after the matter is dealt with by the Central Bankruptcy Court (CBC) on May 26.

Chicken farm operator Chuan Mongpraneet said he and another 93 chicken farmers hadn't received the Bt104 million in payments owed to them from their contracts with the group.

A total of 497 chicken farmers in 18 provinces were reportedly awaiting payments of Bt332 million in total.

The Saha Farm case was submitted to the CBC for corporate rehabilitation on January 10.

Krung Thai Bank and Saha Farm then proposed for a professional services firm to handle the corporate rehabilitation. The CBC set aside May 26 for the trial.
