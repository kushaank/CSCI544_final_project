
Two men who robbed Dh900,000 from a security companys staff have each been sentenced to three years in prison.

The two Nigerians, both unemployed and aged 25 and 23, assaulted the company’s security guards with a stun gun, snatched the suitcase in which the latter were transporting the money to ATMs  and ran away.

The Court of First Instance convicted them of armed robbery and possession of a gun without permit. They were ordered to be deported.

The two staff members were about to enter a centre at Al Muhaisna in Al Qusais when they were attacked. “I was punched in the face by a man while my colleague who was carrying the money was stun- gunned and he fell down,” the guard added.

The two men then snatched the suitcase and ran away.

A police corporal, who happened to witness the defendants running in the car park of a centre in Al Muhaisna 4 around 10.30 am, said they were wearing masks and were being chased by people screaming thieves. He took down their car’s registration number and gave it to the police later.

He said he tried to chase the thieves in vain as they drove recklessly.

The police found the car the defendants used for the heist in an industrial area in Al Qusais two days later. “The suitcases were found in the car in addition to a stun gun and masks. We sent the car to the crime lab for fingerprints and evidence,” a police lieutenant said.

The police raided a flat in Al Nakheel area after learning that the accused were there. The accused resisted at first, but were eventually brought under control and arrested. New electronic devices like computers, mobile phones and tablets, were found in the flat which the accused admitted to have purchased with part of the stolen money.

The defendants led the police to the exchange centre through which they had sent money to their relatives, and the officers recovered the amount of money.
