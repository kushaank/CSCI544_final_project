
The Constitutional Court on Monday heard arguments by the South African Police Service (SAPS) asking it to overturn a Supreme Court of Appeal ruling that compelled South African authorities to investigate alleged crimes against humanity which occurred in Zimbabwe.

Two courts agreed with the applicants, who appealed the SAPS and NPA’s decisions: the South African Litigation Centre and the Zimbabwe Exiles Forum submitted that domestic law, supplemented by international law,  compelled the police to investigate the allegations .

Judgment was reserved on Monday.
