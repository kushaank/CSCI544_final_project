Lionel Messi has signed a new and improved contract with Barcelona, the club has announced.

The Argentina international reached a provisional agreement over a new deal at the end of last week following months of speculation that he had reached an impasse over negotiations.

The Rosario-born star has finally brought an end to speculation surrounding his immediate future by putting pen to paper on a new and improved contract, though the club did not disclose the precise terms of the deal.

"FC Barcelona would like to announce that Leo Messi and the Club signed a revised contract this afternoon," a statement on the club's official website read. "The signing took place in the presence of Leo Messi, his father Jorge Messi and the Club President Josep Maria Bartomeu, as well as the sporting vice-president Jordi Mestre and the Club CEO, Antoni Rossich.

"During the signing, which was made in the Presidential Box at the Camp Nou, Leo Messi repeatedly expressed his excitement about the new deal."
