Northrop Grumman Corp., which makes the B-2 bomber currently used by the Air Force, could mull acquisitions to further stack the cards in its favor as the competition for the future long-range strike bomber gets underway.

Northrop Grumman Corp. has already funneled dollars toward engineering and design efforts for the long-range strike bomber competition. But itâ€™s also mulling acquisitions to further stack the cards in its favor.

Northrop Chief Financial Officer James Palmer remained pretty mum about the ultra-secret bomber program during an interview at the RBC Capital Markets Aerospace & Defense Investors Day last week â€” refusing to share any details about the competitionâ€™s expected timeframe or the scale of the long-term contract once awarded.

But he conceded the program is top priority for driving growth. And he pointed to both suppliers and perhaps even M&A as key components of the strategy.

As reported earlier this month, Northropâ€™s expansion plans in Melbourne, Florida , will focus on designing a prototype for a new long-range strike bomber, as well as updating the two-seat, twin-engined supersonic T-38 jet trainer already in production, and engineering the next generation of the Joint STARS radar used to track battlefield movements from the air.
