
ABIDJAN May 19 (Reuters) - Abundant and regular rains last week in Ivory Coast's cocoa growing regions raised concerns of crop damage, although conditions were good for the development of the mid-crop elsewhere, farmers said on Monday.

The marketing season for the April-to-September mid-crop officially opened on April 1 and harvesting is accelerating rapidly.

Farmers in most regions said the weather conditions should allow strong output into July.

In the western region of Duekoue, farmers said they were concerned about crop damage as it had rained almost the entire week, leading to flooding in some areas.

"The rain has come down hard. There was flooding in some parts and some houses collapsed," said farmer and cooperative manager Amara Kone. "If it continues again this week, we fear that the small pods will fall from the trees ... reducing the harvest," said Kone.

In the southeastern region of Aboisso, farmers reported several spells of abundant rainfall that had interfered with the drying process.

"It is difficult to try to conserve the product in the bush as it's so often shady," said farmer Etienne Yao.
