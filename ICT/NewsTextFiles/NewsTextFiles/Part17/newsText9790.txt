
A widow has been awarded a full military pay out after her same sex partner was killed in action.

Staff Sergeant Donna Johnson was one of three soldiers killed by a suicide bomber in Afghanistan in October 2012.

But her wife, Army National Guard Staff Sergeant Tracy Dice Johnson, was not entitled to the same benefits as a heterosexual wife, due to the Defense of Marriage Act.

However, the Department of Veteran Affairs has now made a decision to award Ms Dice Johnson the payout as well as back dating the payments to her wife’s death in 2012.

She was also awarded Dependency and Indemnity Compensation, usually only given spouses, children or parents, with the current rate at $1,233.23 a month.

In addition she will also receive medical, educational and other benefits.

The landmark decision was announced by the widow at the inaugural National Gala Dinner of the American Military Partner Association, where she received the organisation’s 2014 Community Hero Award.

Ms Dice Johnson, who has legally changed her surname to that of her wife’s, has been an outspoken campaigner on equal rights for the same-sex partners of those in the military.

Upon her wife’s death, it is thought that even though she was listed as next-of-kin, the military didn’t recognise their marriage.

Therefore Donna Johnson’s mother was informed first before her and at first was not given the wedding ring found with her wife’s body.
