
May 19 (Reuters) - South African industrial group Barloworld Ltd reported a 10 percent rise in first-half profit on Monday, citing strong after-market sales, even as project delays at home and in Russia weigh.

Barloworld, the biggest dealer of Caterpillar mining trucks in southern Africa, said headline earnings per share totalled 669 cents in the six months to end-March compared with a 613 cents a year earlier.

Headline EPS, South Africa's main profit measure, strips out certain once-off and non-trading items.

Sales grew 6 percent to 29.9 billion rand ($2.89 billion), helped by after-market sales, which include parts and services for equipment previously purchased by customers.

Business has been slow in recent months for Barloworld due to a four-month strike in the domestic platinum mines while in Russia - where Barloworld also supplies mining trucks - the standoff with Ukraine has slowed economic growth and hit investor confidence.
