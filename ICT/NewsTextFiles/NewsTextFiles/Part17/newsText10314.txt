
A year after rebuilding from devastating floods, businesses in Bundaberg have donated to drought-stricken farmers in Queensland's central west.

Members of the Bundaberg and District Chamber of Commerce, together with donations from the charity Global Care, raised more than $4,000.

Chamber president Yale Morgan says vouchers for local businesses have been distributed to more than 40 farming families in the Longreach area.

"A lot of Australians and Queenslanders rallied behind us, so we in turn are looking for opportunities to help others," he said.

"If we can do something that also keeps the money in the town, that would benefit all concerned.

"We know that it is not going to fix anything but it is more about hope.

"We were given hope in our time of need and I guess this is just something that hopefully we can return the favour.

"I am here purchasing vouchers from local businesses, which we will hand out to 42 farmers.

"It is about letting them know that there are people outside of the community that do care.

"We know that without hope, we perish and as human beings, while things might be tough and difficult, if we have hope, we can continue to move forward."
