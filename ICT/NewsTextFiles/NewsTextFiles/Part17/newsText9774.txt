
Pakistani security forces today seized a huge quantity of arms and explosives, including 100 Kalashnikovs, from a truck near the country's porous border with Afghanistan in the southwestern Balochistan province.

Seventy sacks of explosive materials, 45 bombs, 200 detonators, 100 AK-47 rifles, nine Kalakov rifles, three G-3 rifles and 135 handguns were hidden inside the truck.

Other materials seized included hundred bundles of prima cord, 50 remote-control detonators, sophisticated binoculars, sniper scopes and at least 2,000 rounds of ammunition.

Provincial Home Minister Mir Sarfaraz Bugti said security forces raided a truck in Gulistan, about 8 kilometres from the border with Afghanistan, and seized the cache of weapons and explosives.

Bugti alleged that some neighbouring countries were trying to carry out terror activities to weaken Pakistan.

He claimed that Afghan intelligence agencies have set up at least 34 camps to infiltrate insurgent into Pakistan.

Balochistan has often been at the centre of sectarian violence. Security forces are, however, trying to control the unrest in the area.
