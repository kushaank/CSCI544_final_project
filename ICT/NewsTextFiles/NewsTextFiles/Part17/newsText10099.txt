
Around 11 a.m. 35-year-old Ricky A. Fisher from Nampa, Idaho and 19-year-old Jennifer L Balfe from Meridian, Idaho were arrested and taken into custody without incident and transported to the Lewiston Police Department for questioning.

The two individuals are also suspected of robbing two other banks in Ontario, Oregon as well. The Cottonwood Police Department and the FBI are overseeing the investigation in Cottonwood.

Unfortunately for Fisher and Balfe, the fun and games are over...the cops showed up.
