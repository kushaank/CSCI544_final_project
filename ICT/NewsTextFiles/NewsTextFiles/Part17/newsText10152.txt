
Good time to tell all fools who r talking of a tweet that I didn’t tweet, u suck as much as the grammar of that fake tweet & I’m being kind.

Shahrukh Khan is not only the victim of the fake identity posts but his contemporaries Salman Khan and Aamir Khan have also been targeted. Similar posts were put up with the look alike of their twitter handles.

As far as the decision to leave the country if Narendra Modi become the next Prime Minister, it was Kamaal R Khan who indeed has left the country for Dubai. He also clarified it with his next tweets that it is only him who would be leaving the country.

Ppl pls note I only said tat I will leave India if Modi Ji will become PM I have left India. SRK Salman or Aamir didn’t say anything at all.
