Social Check-In allows passengers to choose who they will be sitting next to on their upcoming flight.

When booking, the airline allows passengers to access a seat map of where other passengers are sitting and gives passengers the ability to choose how much information is shared with the airline and other people booking.

South African Airways also revealed strong growth from key inbound growth from its top 10 markets, including a 14 per cent increase in visitor traffic from Australia.

The attention to detail and high level of service offered, have made this Emirates flight experience excellent all round.
