
President Park is in the United Arab Emirates for a two-day visit to attend a ceremony to mark an installation of the first Korean-made nuclear reactor in that country.

The presidential office in Seoul says this is the first time Korea's nuclear reactor technology and safety will get recognition overseas.

Korea and the UAE have agreed to install a total of four nuclear plants in the Gulf nation by 2020.

Korea hopes to further expand its reach in the global nuclear plant industry by joining hands with the UAE and pave the way for Koreans to find opportunities in the international arena.

During the visit, the president will also meet the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi.

Despite the ongoing situation surrounding the Sewol-ho ferry disaster, officials say President Park decided to make the short trip in consideration of the future of the two sides' economic cooperation.
