
The manager of a rural financial counselling service in western Queensland says he is not concerned about a review of the program.

Federal Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce has asked the National Rural Advisory Council to ensure the service is running effectively and report back by the end of September.

David Arnold from the Central Southern Region counselling service says the review is typical for government-funded programs.

"Every program delivered by government at any level is always reviewed just like the private sector will review their operations," he said.

"So at this stage I'm treating it just as a normal review.

"It's been a good eight to 10 years since the last time the program was reviewed so no it doesn't hold any great concern for me."

Mr Arnold says he is confident it will show the program's worth in rural areas.

"The outcome of any review could always be that they decide that they no longer want to keep it, right through to the other side of the story that they could keep it and give it extra funding, so we just don't know what will come out of it but there's any possibility that we'll come out of it," he said.

"You've just got to go into it with an open mind, give the reviewers the best advice you can and let the Government make the decision after that."
