Parents are confused about the purpose of NAPLAN and students are  generally disinterested in the tests by year 9, a new report has shown.

It concluded that NAPLAN was not in the best interests of young Australians.

The study, commissioned by the Whitlam Institute at  the University of Western Sydney, included interviews with parents,  students, teachers and principals from Victoria and New South Wales.

However, the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority cast doubt on the report's methodology and conclusions.

The study found that 65 per cent of parents had reservations or  were skeptical about NAPLAN but saw some value in "external assessment"  that identified a child's level of "attainment".

Only 25 per cent of parents saw the test results as  important. The majority of students reported feeling stress associated  with NAPLAN. The study included interviews with 70 students, 29  teachers, 26 parents and 16 school leaders.

Students struggling in maths or literacy were "generally anxious" about NAPLAN and were concerned they might fail the tests.

The Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting  Authority said it disagreed with the report's conclusions. "The  conclusions do not reflect the discussion in the report and appear to be  based on poorly constructed questions and unclear interview protocols,"  it said.

The interviews were held last year.
