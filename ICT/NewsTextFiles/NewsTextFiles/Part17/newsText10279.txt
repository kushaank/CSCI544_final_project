
The Adelaide District Court heard the concealed camera captured intensely personal images of 12 people, two of them children.

More small cameras were also found around the property of the Golden Grove man, 75.

The court was told the man started filming because of his infatuation with one of the victims, a young girl.

Judge Sydney Tilmouth says the man had abused the loyalty and trust of the victims and his actions were demeaning.

"The filming began because of an infatuation with one of the young girls ... following a period of depression when you resorted to the computer for solace," he said.

"These offences spring from a perverse fixation leading to a disgusting and insulting invasion of the privacy of your family and friends."

The offender cannot be named as the victims' identity needs to be protected.

The man's jail sentence of two years carries a non-parole period of 16 months.
