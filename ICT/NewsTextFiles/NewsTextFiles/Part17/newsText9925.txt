
London will host a follow-up summit on Boko Haram later in June to finalise a global response to the protracted insurgency in the northeast of Nigeria. This was confirmed by UK officials on Monday barely days after a crisis summit was held in the French capital Paris aimed at exploring ways of tackling the insurgency  in Nigeria.

The United Kingdom has endorsed concrete agreements at Paris and offered London follow-up meeting.

The Paris Summit that mainly focused on Security in Nigeria was convened by the French President François Hollande in response to the abduction of over 200 schoolgirls and the deteriorating security situation in northern Nigeria.

The meeting adopted a number of concrete measures strengthening regional counter terrorism coordination, reinforcing efforts at international level to implement sanctions against Boko Haram and mobilizing support for women exposed to sexual violence in conflict.

In attendance were Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Benin, Niger, the US, France, and the European Union.

London said: â€œThe measures [agreed] today are an important step in bringing the region together in the fight against Boko Haram, and the UK will play our full part in supporting themâ€�.
