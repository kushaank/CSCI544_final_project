
The Dubai Culture and Arts Authority, Dubai Culture, the Emirate's dedicated authority for culture, arts, and heritage, has unveiled the Al Maktoum Hospital Museum.

Preserved through the eyes and experiences of a subset of the hospital's very first doctors, healthcare professionals, and patients, Dubai Culture collated the first phase of data to pay homage to the site through a crowd-sourcing programme, encouraging people to share their stories.

The authority will continue to engage in the crowd-sourcing initiative in various phases, giving people across the country the opportunity to share their insights through the Al Maktoum Hospital Museum.

Situated in Al Wasl District, and developed in collaboration with Wasl Properties, Al Maktoum Hospital Museum marks the first milestone in Dubai Culture's mandate of building museums to preserve the rich Emirati heritage.

H.H. Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Dubai Culture and Arts Authority, said, "Built on the power of storytelling, Al Maktoum Hospital Museum is a living testament to the importance of the community's involvement in preserving and promoting our history and heritage. Embodying the very ambitions of the nation, which strives to showcase its cultural essence to people across the world, Al Maktoum Hospital Museum marks a crucial milestone in Dubai Culture's mandate to strengthen awareness of the Emirate's national identity, as witnessed by its own residents' and citizens' experiences and memories." Al Maktoum Hospital Museum, located within the confines of the original building, paves the path for the city to conserve its history, even as future strides of progress are being made. Built in the 1950s, Al Maktoum Hospital treated patients from across the region. The hospital was built through patronage from several Emirates, although they were not unified at the time.
