
ZIMBABWE and Zambia have agreed to implement a uni-visa regime  starting  next month to boost tourist arrivals between the two  countries.

The neighbouring countries now expect to precede a common visa for   Southern Africa, tourism minister Walter Mzembi said on Monday.

Mzembi told The Source that the concept has been approved by both   governments after the two countries ran a pilot project when they   co-hostedÂ  the United Nations World Tourism Organisation 20th general   assembly in August last year.

âAt policy level we are done. We are just working on a few areas to   ensure the process is smooth.

"As I speak we are talking to the World  Bank and  one of the issues is about funding the project,â said Mzembi  said.

The agreement will also give the Southern Africa Development  Community  (SADC) an opportunity to evaluate the feasibility of a common  visa before the  bloc heads of state meet in Victoria Falls in August  to consider the issue, he  said.
