
Bloemfontein - The trial of a man accused of taking part in a rightwing coup plot will resume in the Bloemfontein High Court on Monday.

On Thursday, the State closed its case against treason accused Johan Prinsloo.

Prosecutor Torie Pretorius handed a list of admissions to the court the accused had made, in agreement with his legal counsel Johann Nel.

Prinsloo, 51, of Springs in Gauteng, faces charges of treason, conspiracy to take part in terrorist acts, and possession of illegal ammunition.

Prinsloo, Martin Keevy, 49, and Mark Trollip, 48, were arrested for an alleged plan to attack the African National Congress's Mangaung conference at the University of the Free State in Bloemfontein in December 2012.

Prinsloo allegedly attempted, between July 2012 and December 16, 2012, to overthrow the government by trying to obtain mortar bombs and other weapons to attack President Jacob Zuma and Cabinet ministers during the conference. He pleaded not guilty to all the charges.
