GCC Companies hiring expats for their expertise should explain the role they will play towards nationalisation schemes during the hiring process, according to an HR expert.

Many Gulf companies still rely on expats to fill skilled positions, but government backed nationalisation programmes in countries including the UAE and Saudi Arabia aim to bring more locals into the work force.

Thomas advised companies to explain their nationalisation goals to new hires, telling expats how they should imbue their skills within an organisation’s structure before they move on.

He argued that there would always be certain national workers that would look for easier roles in the public sector.
