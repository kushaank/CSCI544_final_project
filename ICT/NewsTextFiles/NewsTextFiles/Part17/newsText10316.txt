Some Telstra customers  were unable to make fixed calls on Monday because of a technical glitch.

About 80,000 Telstra customers were unable to make fixed line calls for more than an hour on Monday afternoon when a technical glitch brought down services in Perth CBD.

A Telstra spokesman said phone landlines in Perth and surrounding suburbs could not call out or receive between 2.30pm and 4pm.

He said the outage was caused by a node at the exchange which was quickly repaired.

“Telstra apologises for any inconvenience caused,” he said.
