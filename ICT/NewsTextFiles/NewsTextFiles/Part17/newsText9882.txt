
Soweto - Two teenage boys charged with murdering two Soweto schoolgirls are expected to appear in the Protea Magistrate's Court on Monday.

After the last court proceedings on May 15, one of the teenagers was sent to Sterkfontein Psychiatric Hospital for mental observation.

The boys, who cannot be named because they are minors, were arrested in connection with the murders of Thandeka Moganetsi, 15, and Chwayita Rathazayo, 16. The girls were found dead in a field in Dobsonville, Soweto, in February.
