
Johannesburg - A Limpopo woman accused of killing her 20-month-old baby girl appeared in the Ritavi Magistrate's Court on Monday, police said.

Christina Makhanani Baloyi, 20, would remain in police custody until her second appearance on Friday, police spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi said.

The matter was postponed for further investigation.

Police found the baby's body inside a pit toilet in Mbekwana village, Letsitele, just outside Tzaneen on Thursday.

"Police were alerted by community members after hearing hysterical screams of a baby from the toilet. Unfortunately, by the time the police arrived and rescued the girl from the stinking, cold toilet pit, Xitsunduxo Baloyi was already dead," he said.

Baloyi, an unemployed mother of two, allegedly strangled the baby and threw her into the toilet, thinking she was dead.
