
KABUL â€“ Lawmakers in the Senate, upper house of the Afghan parliament ordered investigation into the alleged recruitment of Afghan refugees by the Iranian security forces to fight in Syria, an Afghan news service reported on Monday.

Senate Chairman Fazal Hadi Muslimyar asked the Afghan government to seek clarification from Iran in this regard. He said that the poor Afghan refugees were recruited and sent to fight in Syria where they were killed and the government of Afghanistan should resolve the issue.

According to some foreign media reporters, the Iranian forces have recruited thousands of the Afghan refugees to fight against the rebel forces in Syria, the Khaama Press reported. The Afghan refugees are also granted Iranian residency, $500 a month, school registration for their children and charity card to help the Syrian government.

Syrian armed opposition forces claimed in the video that the bodies belong to Iran however an Afghan identity card could also be seen with one of the victim.
