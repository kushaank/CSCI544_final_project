
Prof  Chinyere Ezeaka, a professor of  Paediatrics at  the College of  Medicine, University of Lagos, says Nigeria must reduce its neonatal mortality rate to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

Ezeaka  said this as  guest lecturer at the Nestle Nutrition Institute Africa Advanced Nutrition Programme  held at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan.

According to her, Nigeria rates highest in Africa and second highest in child birth mortality in the world after India.

“Under-five year’s old mortality is increasing and about 700 newborns die daily.

“It is pertinent to note that about 90 per cent of these deaths are preventable with appropriate information,’’ Ezeaka said.

She called for increased capacity building for health workers and provision of data and information by the government.

Also speaking, an expert from Ghana, Prof. Steiner Asiedu,  advised new mothers to undertake supplementary and complementary feeding  without compromising the ideals  of hygiene.

According to Asiedu, research has  shown that breast milk is the backbone of lifelong health as it is rich in colostrum, vitamins, minerals and protein.

“Breast milk is easier for the baby to digest, it is hygienic and does not cause allergies for babies;  it requires no preparation and is therefore most convenient for babies, ” she said.

In a goodwill message, a consultant paediatrician, Dr Ayede Aderonke, said that the first  1,000 days of a new born were very critical as a lot of adaptation takes place.
