
As the world stands together against Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram’s abduction of over 230 Nigerian school girls in Chibok, the ANC Women’s League lit candles at the Nigerian embassy in Pretoria last night.

ANCWL president Angie Motshekga, ANC members and other organisations led a procession in which they lit 230 candles.

Motshekga said the candles represented the number of missing girls as a way to encourage their mothers not to lose hope until they were home safe.

“The lighting will be done at the Nigerian embassy and we urge South Africans to join us and pray for the safe return of the girls,” she said before the procession. The ANCWL’s campaign would be an ongoing one.

“Starting on Thursday we will have mass prayer meetings in various churches, stadiums and other venues to pray for the safe return of the girls. On Africa Day we urge all women to unite in prayer for the girls and their loved ones,” Motshekga said.

She called on all people to sign a social solidarity petition for the Bring Back Our Girls campaign.

“The petition will be available on the ANC and ANC Women’s League websites and we will hand it over to Nigerian government,” Motshekga said.

From May 21-23 there will also be picketing in selected public buildings led by the Sesonke Men Sector and Men’s Group in Action.

Young Communist League secretary Buti Manamela lashed out at the Nigerian government as he read a memorandum at the Nigerian High Commission in Pretoria.

“If the missing girls were the daughters of the president or some high-profile people, Boko Haram would be history by now,” he said. “Those missing children are loved by their parents, we don’t treat them differently. We have noticed how the AU procrastinates in solving issues like this,” he said.
