
SINGAPORE: Gold steadied yesterday after two consecutive sessions of losses but remained below the key $1,300-an-ounce level, weighed down by strong US economic data and waning investor interest.

Spot gold ticked up 0.2 percent to $1,295.70 an ounce by 0635 GMT, while platinum gained 0.7 percent. Palladium rose about half a percent.

“With generally bright US economic data and eurozone’s impending stimulus propping up dollar prospects, we are more inclined to a bearish break in gold prices,” said Phillip Futures analyst Joyce Liu.

Gold, often seen as a safe-haven investment, has gained 7.5 percent so far this year from tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine though it has fallen back recently due to outflows from gold funds and strong data.

SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s top gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell 0.26 tonnes to 781.99 tonnes on Friday, in a sign of softening investor demand.

The company signalled it expected the strike, prompted by the fall-off in wage negotiations, to continue.
