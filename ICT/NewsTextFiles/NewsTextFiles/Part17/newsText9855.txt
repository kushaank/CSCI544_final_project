
JOHANNESBURG - Former Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Tony Leon on Monday admitted he was surprised by Lindiwe Mazibuko's decision to step down as parliamentary leader.

According to weekend reports, there is speculation of a rift between Mazibuko and DA leader Helen Zille.

She accused the Sunday Times of publishing misleading articles and falsely quoting her on Mazibuko's departure.

Leon says the reaction to the announcement has not been ideal.
