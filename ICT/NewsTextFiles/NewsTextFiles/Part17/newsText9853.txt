
UNDETERRED by its failure to make huge gains in Western Cape, the African National Congress (ANC) in the province is now working on winning back the "strategic" Cape Town metro.

The party believes it has a "strong chance" of unseating the Democratic Alliance (DA) in the 2016 municipal elections, according to ANC provincial leader Marius Fransman. He said further that he would not be taking up any ministerial position, in order to focus on growing the ANC in the province. Mr Fransman is currently the Deputy Minister of International Relations and Co-operation.

The DA won 59.2% of the provincial vote in the general elections this month, increasing its outright majority in the Western Cape. The ANC, on the other hand, only slightly improved its support base by winning just more than 33% of the provincial vote.

Mr Fransman said the results showed that the ANC was recovering from "a difficult period". The party lost control of the Western Cape, South Africa’s second-wealthiest province, after infighting among its members divided it along racial lines.

In 2009, the DA won just more than 51% of the province’s vote, while the ANC’s share fell to 31.55%, from about 46% in 2004.

Mr Fransman said the party had grown its support in the Cape Flats and that this boded well for its drive to win the Cape Town metro in 2016. But recent trends suggest the ANC will struggle to unseat the DA in the city and other municipalities in the Western Cape.

In the 2011 local government elections, out of 30 municipalities, the ANC only won Beaufort West outright and lost in some of its former strongholds such as Breede River and Saldanha Bay. The DA put on an impressive performance, winning 12 local councils, including Cape Town, Berg River, Drakenstein and Stellenbosch.

Mr Fransman conceded that while the ANC in the province had grown, the DA had advanced faster and this was the challenge facing the party. "We grew in some areas of the Cape Flats, but obviously that was not enough to topple the DA," he said.

The ANC’s provincial executive committee had met at the weekend to analyse the results and to draw up plans to improve the party, Mr Fransman said.

"We have consolidated the vote of 2009 and our performance (in the 2014 general elections) shows that the ANC in the Western Cape is recovering from a difficult period.

"We want to use our performance as a basis to continue our programme for growth. We increased our vote in some of the municipalities and we believe this is a good sign of how we will perform in 2016 ."

Meanwhile, Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille at the weekend announced a reshuffling of the mayoral committee for the metropolitan municipality. She appointed four new members to the executive body.

The new members include Johan van der Merwe, who has been put in charge of the department of economic, environment and spatial planning, and Xanthea Limberg, who joins the provincial cabinet to head corporate services.

The other new appointees are Benedicta van Minnen, who will head the department of health, and Siyabulela Mamkeli, who has been made member of the mayoral committee responsible for human settlements.
