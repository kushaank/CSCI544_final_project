
Subunits of the Armenian Armed Forces shattered ceasefire with Azerbaijan in Kohnagishlag village of Gazakh region, Sarijali, Kangarli and Yusifjanli villages of Aghdam region, Goyarkh village of Tartar region and nameless hills of Khojavend and Fuzuli regions on May 18 and on the night of May 19.

The Armenians were silenced with a retail fire, the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry said.

The precarious cease-fire between Azerbaijan and Armenia was reached after a lengthy war that displaced over a million Azerbaijanis and has been in place between the two South Caucasus countries since 1994. Since the hostilities, Armenian armed forces have occupied over 20 percent of Azerbaijan's internationally recognized territory, including the Nagorno-Karabakh region and seven surrounding districts.

The UN Security Council has adopted four resolutions on Armenia's withdrawal from the Azerbaijani territory, but they have not been enforced to this day.
