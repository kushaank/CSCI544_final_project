
The Olympian will return to court where the judge presiding his case is to determine when he will head to his 30-day psychiatric evaluation, which could happen immediately or much later on. The move comes after Pistorius’ defense called Merryl Vorster to the stand, a psychiatrist who testified the athlete was a danger to society. The prosecution pounced on the statement and applied to have Blade Runner sent for evaluation.

Oscar Pistorius will be back in court Tuesday to find out when he will get his head examined.

That means there is a chance that Pistorius, who is currently out on bail, might be immediately shipped off to a nearby mental institution in Pretoria.

If that happens, Pistorius will spend the first two weeks being grilled by a team of psychologists tasked with preparing a report on his mental health for the judge presiding over his case, officials said.

And it means a big delay in a sensational trial that started March 3 and has attracted worldwide attention.

Local legal expert Llewelyn Curlewis said Team Pistorius made a big mistake putting psychiatrist Merryl Vorster on the stand.

Among other things, Vorster said an armed Pistorius was a danger to society.

Pistorius claims he accidentally killed 29-year-old Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine’s Day 2013 when he mistook her for a burglar in his home's master bathroom.

Prosecutors contend the 27-year-old sprinter, who relies on prosthetics to compete and get around, chased Steenkamp on his stumps to the bathroom and blasted four times through the door in a fit of jealous rage.

They have described the fallen Olympian as a volatile and paranoid gun nut.

Pistorius faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted of premeditated murder.
