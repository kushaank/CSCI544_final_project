Deepend Films and its sister companies Deep End Post-Production and Splash  FX have earned considerable acclaim lately with the production of a number of  documentaries, two of which took home major awards at the South African Film  and Television Awards (SAFTAs), held at the beginning of April.

The completed documentaries form part of an ongoing series exploring the lives  and work of some of South Africas leading visual artists. Chickens Can Fly, which  took the awards for Best Director of a Documentary Feature (for Deepend  founder and executive producer Paulene Abrey) and Best Cinematography in a  Documentary Feature (for Paul Kruger) and was also nominated in the Best  Documentary Feature Category, focuses on Pieter van der Westhuizen. Light  and Dark, which was nominated for Best Editor, Best Cinematographer, Best  Director and Best Documentary Feature, looks at Norman Catherine. Norman  Catherine Curriculum Vitae continues the exploration of this artists work, and  Outsider, which is due for release this month, examines the work of Beezy  Bailey.

Deepend Films was founded by Abrey, together with Luaan Hong, in order to  create original content under the Deepend banner, in addition to the services it  already offers in the area of post-production. The three companies closely  complement and add value to one another, with Deepend Films creating  content, and Deepend Post and Splash finishing the products from offline to  online and effects. Of course, the two post and finishing facilities also offer their  services independently.

Deepend Films is currently working on several features, including three more on  the lives of South African artists. Outsider, their most recently finished feature,  will premiere at the Labia in Cape Town on 14 May, followed by a screening at  Cine Centre Killarney, Johannesburg on 19 May.
