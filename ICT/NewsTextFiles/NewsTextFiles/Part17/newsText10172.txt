
The workers who helped build New York University’s recently completed campus in Abu Dhabi faced harsh labor conditions, with some of them saying that they were beaten, jailed, or deported after going on strike, The New York Times reported.

Strikes are illegal in the United Arab Emirates, and the Times noted that working conditions there are often difficult. Margaret Bavuso, executive director of campus operations for NYU Abu Dhabi, told the newspaper she had worked with contractors and the government to ensure workers were treated humanely.

“We will be working with our Abu Dhabi partners to investigate these reports vigorously,” Mr. Sexton said.

The texts of Mr. Sexton’s email and Mr. Beckman’s statement are quoted on the blog NYU Local.

The Times found no violations of some of the provisions of NYU’s statement on labor values, such as its prohibition on child labor and its requirement that workers get free transportation to their job sites.
