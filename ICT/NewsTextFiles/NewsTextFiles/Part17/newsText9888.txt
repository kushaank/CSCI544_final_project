
Atterbell Investments, trading as Gallagher Estate, said the ANC Youth League owed it more than R4m for four events at the centre in June 2011.

In April it asked the court to place the ANCYL under final liquidation or provisionally sequestrate it.

According to an affidavit by the convention centre's chief executive Adolf Venter, a default judgment was handed down on the matter in September 2011.

In March, another liquidation case against the league was settled out of court. High Court Judge Phillip Boruchowitz discharged a provisional liquidation order made in November last year.

The original liquidation order against the league was applied for by Bloemfontein events company Z2 Presentations, which had originally been tasked with running the ANCYL's 2008 national conference in the Free State. The conference left the company R15m out of pocket after the league did not pay its bill.

A hotel, trading as Palanquin Hospitality Management and based in Bloemfontein, claimed R1.5m from the ANCYL, lawyer Steven van Rensburg said during a new court application in January.

Palanquin, which is in liquidation, provided accommodation for the conference delegates.
