
Cape Town - Information about DA federal executive discussions is being leaked by members who want to advance their succession agendas, in the party and its parliamentary caucus, DA leader Helen Zille says.

In her column SA Today on Sunday, she responded to a newspaper report that alleged she had launched an attack on former parliamentary leader Lindiwe Mazibuko, who was leaving Parliament to study at Harvard University.

She had not attacked Mazibuko and the leaks, which had been “selective”, had been discussed at the federal executive meeting on Friday, Zille wrote.

She explained the exchange between herself and DA Eastern Cape leader Athol Trollip, who had asked about Mazibuko’s reasons for leaving.
