
BACKYARD farmers are encouraged to participate in the Agricultural Fair this Saturday at the Civic Center in Susupe, Saipan Agricultural Fair Association president Ramon C. Camacho said.

“We want to encourage local produce and have more local consumers,” he added.

The competition is open to subsistence and commercial farmers who will compete in various categories of livestock, vegetables and fruits.

Camacho said competitors should only submit entries from their own farms.

Over the weekend, Gov. Eloy S. Inos signed a proclamation designating May 24 as Saipan Agricultural Fair Day as he urged community members to continue supporting local farmers and ranchers who have been promoting traditional and cultural agricultural practices.

Last year, the committee received complaints about competitors submitting farm products from other farmers.

This year, they are expecting all entries, especially livestock, to be at the competition site by Friday.

Everything is set for the Agricultural Fair on Saturday, Camacho said, adding that the event is supported by Northern Marianas College-Cooperative Research and Extension Education Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

During the fair, he said, personnel from NMC-CREES will present a demonstration on hydroponics and aquaculture technology.

The Sabalu Farmers Market will continue to operate at the Civic Center while the Agricultural Fair competition is held.

Camacho said the sale of tickets for their fundraising program will continue until the raffle draw on Saturday.

The grand prize is a live cow; second prize, a live deer; third prize, a live pig; fourth prize, another live pig; and fifth prize, a live goat.

Consolation prizes include ducks and animal feed.

Tickets are $5 each and can be bought at the Division of Agriculture office in Kagman, the CNMI Government Animal Quarantine Facility in As Perdido, and at the Sabalu Street Market.
