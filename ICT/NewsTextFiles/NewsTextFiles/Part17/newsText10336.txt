
Melbourne Rebels half-back Luke Burgess will be sidelined for up to two months because of a knee injury.

Burgess sustained the injury during the second half of the Rebels' historic 30-27 win over Queensland at Lang Park last Saturday night.

The 37-Test capped Burgess joins fellow half-back Nic Stirzaker (ankle) on the Rebels' injury list, with Ben Meehan expected to wear the number nine jersey against New South Wales at AAMI Park on Friday night.

The victory over the Reds was the Rebels' first in seven encounters against their Australian conference rival.

They hold a 4-7 record on 21 points to be fourth in the Australian conference and 11th on the overall standings.
