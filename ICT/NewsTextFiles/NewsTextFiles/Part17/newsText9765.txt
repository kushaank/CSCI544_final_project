“There, Rep. Greg Walden, the committee’s chairman, introduced Thornberry to a crowd that included defense bigwigs as the ‘next chairman’ of the committee, according to an attendee. Rep. Mike Turner, who is frequently mentioned as a contender for the role, was even in the room that night.

— WHAT ABOUT FORBES AND TURNER? Rep. Randy Forbes (R-Va.) and Turner (R-Ohio) are still in the running, but their chances are looking unlikely.

Why? First of all, Thornberry is the next in line for the chairmanship by committee seniority.

ADD ALBURQUERQUE TO THE VA SCANDAL LIST, reports The Daily Beast’s Jacob Siegel: Stories of secret waiting lists used to conceal actual wait times for veterans wanting to see a doctor started in Phoenix, Ariz., but have spread to other cities. Now, it appears to have been a common practice at a VA hospital in Albuquerque too.

“The evidence for this new secret list may be hard to track down, however.

McDONOUGH ECHOES SHINSEKI, SAYS OBAMA’S ‘MADDER THAN HELL’, via POLITICO’s Jonathan Topaz: White House chief of staff Denis McDonough continued to do damage control this weekend over the scandal that’s rocking the Veterans Affairs Department.

— AMERICAN LEGION IS NOT IMPRESSED: “This move by VA is not a corrective action, but a continuation of business as usual. Dr. Petzel was already scheduled to retire this year, so his resignation now really won't make that much of a difference,” American Legion National Commander Daniel Dellinger said in a statement after the news broke Friday.

JAMES MILLER TELLS POLITICO’s SHAUN WATERMAN THAT CYBER RED TEAMS ARE ON THE RISE AT DoD: “Most certainly, DoD is red-teaming both the architecture overall and the operations.
