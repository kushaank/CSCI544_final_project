
Now the U.S. Department of Agriculture has confirmed that the same CBP office recently made a first-in-the-nation pest discovery when they intercepted a moth, Nemapogon gersimovi, while inspecting a shipment of bulk organic soybeans from China.

This moth could pose a significant agriculture threat because they are known to feed on seeds and grains, reducing farmersâ€™ yields.

The moth was discovered in a 50,000 pound shipment of bulk organic soybeans from China destined for Pennsylvania and intended for animal feed. CBP then forwarded the specimen to a USDA entomologist for identification.

CBP issued an Emergency Action Notification to the importer requiring the shipment to be re-exported or destroyed. The importer chose to re-export the shipment.

CBP agriculture specialists have extensive training and experience in the biological sciences and agricultural inspection. On a typical day nationally, they inspect almost 1 million people as well as air and sea cargoes imported to the United States, and they seize 4,379 prohibited meats, plant materials, and animal products, including 440 insect pests.
