BISMARCK, N.D. – A major campaign is being planned to restore North Dakota’s dairy industry.

Meeting in Mandan, N.D., the North Dakota Dairy Coalition, together with representatives of crop commodity groups and the dairy industry, discussed how more farmers can be attracted to dairy production.

“Rebuilding of our dairy industry will give crop and forage producers more local marketing avenues, as well as an opportunity to explore the possibilities of dairy farming themselves,” said Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring.

The number of dairy farms in North Dakota has fallen to fewer than 100.

Hoff said Wednesday’s meeting demonstrated the importance of bringing additional resources into the effort to regrow the dairy farming in the state.

Goehring pointed out that North Dakota has three dairy processing plants, largely dependent on locally-produced milk.
