
ICT veteran Henry Ferreira will join Pinnacle Holdings' board from next month to increase its capacity and assist in managing the company's future growth.

In a statement issued to shareholders, the listed company says Ferreira held the role of CEO of AxizWorkgroup, a major subsidiary in the Pinnacle Group, for the last two years.

He has been appointed to the position of executive director: head of distribution for Pinnacle.

Ferreira has more than 30 years' experience in the ICT industry, says Pinnacle. "He is well known in the South African market for his roles as country GM for Hewlett Packard SA, and MD of Compaq Africa."

Before joining AxizWorkgroup as the CEO in February 2012, Ferreira held the position of country GM for Lenovo Africa, where he was responsible for managing and growing the Lenovo business while maintaining and growing relationships with key enterprise customers and business partners.

Ferreira took over at AxizWorkgroup, Doug Woolley, who left the company, after more than a decade, to take up a position at one of its clients, Business Connexion (BCX).

Woolley was the fifth senior manager out of 25 to leave the company within the past six to seven months.

Ferreira has also held executive positions with Microsoft Southern Africa, Nokia Networks, Unisys Africa and Hewlett Packard UK & Ireland.
