
Preatoni, a European property developer, has set up a subsidiary in Dubai to advance and grow its portfolio in the Middle East markets.

"We have built high-class tourism and residential complexes, hotels and leisure centers worth 2.5 billion euros in the Mena region, such as the Domina Coral Bay Resort in Sharm El Sheikh Egypt," said Ernesto Preatoni, Founder and Chairman of Preatoni Real Estate.

By opening its headquarters in Dubai, Preatoni aims to expand its portfolio of residential and commercial complexes, as well as hotel and touristic developments, to add to its number of hotels around the world, some of which are their own properties, while others fall in ‘management’ and ‘management and franchising’ categories.
